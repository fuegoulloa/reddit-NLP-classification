t3_1fv4vli,Just how many people have been scammed by edreams? ,"I recently found I was charged 60 euros by a travel company called edreams. I had never booked a flight with them, so I contacted them via email, and they were kind enough to answer that they would help me identify the transaction.

After one month of back and forth emails, they apologized and let me know that while they DID charge me for a subscription, **there was NO account under my name, email or telephone number.**

The story should have ended with a refund then and there, but they also let me know they would NOT be refunding the money. They were also unclear on how or where they got my credit card information.

This is where I started digging, and I found **they have been doing this for years!**

Any google search for edreams will immediately bring up hundreds of social media posts with the same fraudulent charge disguised as a ""subscription"".

At this point, out of personal interest, I'm interested in collecting names and testimonials from other people with that have unknowingly ""subscribed"" to an edreams membership. 

I think there's a clear case for consumer fraud, and I'm sending this to a couple of European consumer agencies!"
t3_1fv4z6a,Required to carry significant amount of cash to Thailand,"I was told by my tour organizer that we are required to carry THB 20,000 per adult when visiting Thailand and is not just sufficient to show this as a bank statement.

t3_1fvgocr,First time in a hostel,I am heading out to London and Wales next week. I am staying in a hostel for the first time and am going to be alone in London. I am staying with friends in Wales.

And convince myself the hostel is going to be fine and I am not going to regret staying in one. 
t3_1fvaxy8,What is it with every business begging for Google or TripAdvisor review?,"I’m currently in Egypt (spoiler: I love it), and I was wondering why is it that every business asks for Google or TripAdvisor review? They also ask for the waiter/tour guide/contact person’s name to be mentioned in the review. I kinda can understand that tour agencies need it to boost their sales, but an established 5-star resort? It feels a bit off-putting. And this is not in Egypt only. Last year in Jordan, a dude literally waited over my partner’s head for a Google review in a 5-star hotel. 

Can anyone shed some light on this?"
t3_1fueq0d,Ten days in Brazil 🇧🇷 ,"Recently I had the chance to visit Brazil and wanted to share some of my picture and experiences.  I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

Thanks for being a great host Brazil, Obrigado!"
t3_1fvhpl2,International Driver's Permit for Vietnam,"I'm looking to rent motorbikes while in Vietnam. I have a valid U.S. driver's license for passenger vehicles - but I don't have a motorcycle license.

Do I need an IDP for motorcycles to rent one in Vietnam? If so, do I need a motorcycle license in the U.S. to get the IDP?

I've heard Vietnam only recognizes the 1968 IDP, how do I know if I'm applying for the right one?"
t3_1fv9dcs,14h&amp;2h or 7h&amp;10h flight combinations? Which would you prefer? ,"I am flying from the east coast of the United States to Windhoek Namibia. Which would you prefer or recommend?

8:55P NWR to JNB 6:36P local (14h) &gt;&gt; 16 hour layover &gt;&gt; 10:40A JNB to WDH 12:50P local (2h)

5:50P NWR to FRA 7:25A local (7.5h) &gt;&gt; 14 hour layover &gt;&gt; 10:00P FRA to WDH 9:15A local (10h)

I am torn. First about me: (1) No business class (2) I sleep on flights. Not necessarily well but I can pass out for an entire 7 hour red eye flight. (3) I have been to Frankfurt before.

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

Some people say just get it over with and do one really long flight. Thoughts?"
t3_1fvavhr,Where to take a train from Amsterdam?,"My wife and I are planning a two-week trip to Europe in early December. I've never been, and she's been to Catania and London.

I have a large bag I will be using for paragliding that I will not need on the second half of the trip to Egypt.

t3_1fv6tud,"Looking to take first ""nice"" trip with wife after recent family tragedy. In US, late October/early November. Looking for: quiet, peaceful, nature, hot springs and/or warm weather. I guess a resort? This is all new to us, as we usually do more budget trips, hiking, etc.","Edit: HUGE thank you for the very thoughtful responses. We're going to do a more local trip this year, and take all of this info and start looking at a big trip for next year. This has been super helpful!!



We lost my wife's father this year and have both been doing a lot of work on ourselves, our relationship, and finding peace. I don't even know where to begin, but I kind of have a picture in my mind. I'm intentionally leaving price and region vague as I'm curious what comes to mind when you read what I'm looking for, and we are flexible in these departments. We are not wealthy, but are dual-income, no kids, and never treat ourselves. Mid-30s.

Must haves: Quiet, beautiful, access to nature/hiking trails, either warm weather or moderate, hot springs or hot tubs outside, good food, everything we need on-site. We're looking for romance, privacy, healing. A day spent reading, strolling a trail, and having healthy food would be the perfect day.

Would also love: horses or other animals, no kids, yoga

Do not want/need: party vibes, stuffy, corporate, cell service, internet, TV, alcohol

You know that show *Intervention*, at the end when they send people to these rustic places out in the desert to put their brains back together after years of hard living? It might sound funny but that's what I keep thinking of!"
t3_1fv2ci5,2 month train loop of France,"Hi everyone, I am in the beginning stages of planning a 1-2 month trip around France next September entirely by rail. I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille. 

This is a lot, so thank you very much for reading it and any advice you have for me!"
t3_1fudlmf,Trip to Hongkong🇭🇰,"Hong Kong can be describe like state in state. Even tho It’s officialy part of China, this special administrative zone have their own parliament, currency, army and even visa policy. You can travel here visa free. Hong Kong was for a long time part of British empire and you can see british influence everywhere (architecture, food and even language). Unlike the most of China, people in Hong Kong are more fluent in english which can be really helpful when you can’t find specific location. I can only recommend you to visit. 

Places on the photos:
1. Nan Lian Garden
2. Central Hong Kong
3. Tian Tan Buddha 
4. Viewpoint from Victoria peak
5. Statue of Bruce Lee
6. View from Avenue of Stars

11. Chi Lin Nunnery"
t3_1fvi4bm,Should we visit Krakow or Wroclaw?,"Hi all,

Me and a group of friends are organising a trip to Poland in late November and are trying to decide between Krakow or Wroclaw.

The one bit of extra info I’m curious to hear about (besides all the basic stuff like which is better, is one cheaper than the other etc) is one of the group mentioned that Krakow is conservative and slightly homophobic, can anyone speak to this one way or the other?

My personal preference is to go to Krakow but curious to hear people’s thoughts.

Thanks "
t3_1fvejry,"International trip soon, needing luggage advice for Christmas gift","
Hey, looking to get my hubs luggage for an Xmas gift for an international trip i am planning. We have never bought rolling/360 spinner luggage before and I'm wondering for international flights would a checked roller or a carry on roller make more sense? Our gift $ limit makes it where i might not be able to find a 2 piece set... so im asking if you could ONLY choose ONE what makes the most sense? (We are not the type to overpack)

Also in my research I keep coming back to travelpro brand. is this a sturdy/good brand? Anyone swear by any another brand (moderately priced)?

t3_1fvhkll,Which Eastern European city to start with?,"So, we're planning a trip to Europe in next few months. We are a family from usa which has already visited Western Europe and now we want to visit the other side of Europe to see what it has to offer and also to save money. We're wondering which country would be perfect for our criteriums - has something to offer for family, great cuisine, interesting landmarks for reasonable prices. Guess all of them are cheap. We've already been to Greece, Italy and France and liked it all, but now we want to see something different.

Which country would be perfect for us? Which is like the best to start exploring Eastern Europe?

Edit: Mistake in post name, wanted to write a country, but also we want to visit a city in that country for sure :)"
t3_1fvcw14,Visiting Cotopaxi in Ecuador without the hike ,"I'll be visiting Ecuador for about a week coming up.  I'll be in Quito for a couple days and then descending down to the amazon for 5 days.  I then come back up to Quito and was looking at going to Cotopaxi for the day. 

  
My only concern is the hike up the side of the volcano will be very difficult because of the altitude and I will not have time to acclimatize in Quito beforehand.  

Has anyone done the Cotopaxi hike without acclimatizing beforehand?  

Are there any ways to visit the national park and base of Cotopaxi without doing the hike? "
t3_1fvbygf,From Laos to China with train?,"Hello everyone!
I'm traveling in Southeast Asia for a few months soon. I'm currently planning my approximate route and have seen that you could theoretically take the train from Laos to South China (Laos-China-Railway). 
Of course, I first checked what the conditions for a visa are and it seems to be relatively easy at the moment (visa-free entry). In other words, German nationals can enter China for tourism purposes for up to 15 days.
Unfortunately, I can hardly find any experiences or reports on the internet...

Have any of you had experience with the train and entering China with this visa and/or by train from Laos? 

I would be super grateful for any advice 🫶🏽"
t3_1fve0i2,"Best Value Short Beach Vacation location for a couple... Mexico, Colombia, Dominican Republic, or other?","I'm an American, looking to vacation somewhere warm. I'd be taking my gf (we are in our mid 30's)

Ideally, somewhere that the weather is warm, the beer is cold, and is relatively safe. I don't really want to travel around and sight see. I mostly want to wake-up, go to the beach and drink, then go somewhere to eat. 

I speak a bit of Spanish, so a Spanish speaking country would be ideal compared to say a Portuguese speaking country. 

I've been to both Mexico and the D.R. (Punta Cana) and enjoyed both.

Any advice/city recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Again, trying to minimize cost without sacrificing much safety/good weather.

My goal would be to kill some hours at the Mall of Asia in Manila and then return to the airport. The alternative is to fly in the evening before and spend the whole day in Manila before heading to the airport in the evening. 

I look forward to reading your input. Will I run the significant risk of missing my international flight in the evening when my domestic flight is delayed? Will Manila drive me crazy without a hotel room to relax? "

t3_1fvfh47,Vietnam Itinerary Suggestions ,"Hi all! Early next month (November), we will be traveling for two weeks in Vietnam. The trip has come up quite suddenly, so I haven't had a ton of time to do research yet. I would appreciate anyone's comments, additions, or suggestions regarding the interary I've put together.  At the moment, I only have a flight into the north and out of the south booked, but I need to submit an address for my evisa, so I'd like to have at least my first hotel sorted out soon. 

I've never been to Vietnam, so all I know about now are the main points which I read about online. The buses looked interesting, but considering the low cost of domestic flights, and the long distances, I think we will just plan to fly between the major cities. I am not sure if it is best to spend so long in HCMC, or if we should spread some of those days to a different city. We are interested in historical places/museums, shorter hikes, beaches, and good food. Also, any additional tips about day trips from the big cities would be awesome!
Thanks in advance!

2nd/3rd - Hanoi
4/5th - Ha Long bay
6th - fly to Da Nang
7th - explore Da Nang
8th - day trip to Hue
9th - day trip to Hoi an

t3_1fv8yyh,Help my expand my Asia trip,"Hi, I am a single 36M from the UK and I have booked my first solo trip (hurray!) to Japan some weeks ago. Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

Also happily take alternative itineraries! Other countries I find interesting are Vietnam,  China and Indonesia. 

Many thanks! "

Currently thinking the budget for food/shopping/activities will end up being an average of ~100£/day for the both of us. 

Was also thinking of applying for a no fx fee credit card and using that for day to day/shopping expenses. 

Not sure which option is better or if it really just comes down to preference. 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks for reading!"

t3_1fvboxg,Late December trip suggestion ,"Hello everyone,

I’m planning my winter holidays and need some advices

contexte : I am a 30 French woman from Paris and I have some holidays from the 19th till the 1st of january 2025, I might extend them till the 13th as the 13th is my bday i want to be away for this. So its between the 19th till 13th January.  
i’ll travel solo and have a budget of \~2500. My non-négociable is : nothing COLD, for me winter holidays are to go as much as possible from the gloomy weather, a little break from the winter depression.  
i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

Sorry for the long post, I welcome all feedback/ suggestions. Any help welcome !

Thanks!"

t3_1fvauvm,4-Day Trip in Late October - Iceland or Tromsø Without a Car? Need Recommendations!,"Hey fellow travelers!

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

Any thoughts or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much!"

2) Gwangju or Gyeongju, still haven’t decided yet

3) Busan

I moved out from my home in New Orleans to Phoenix for some work that is coming to a close around mid-November. Afterwards, I’m planning on driving home, BUT with a twist! This time, I wanna take a bit of an adventure around the West Coast since I’m not out here a lot, and because it’s apparently beautiful around here for the last few months of the year, so I figured I’d have a drive around here for a few weeks before I head on home!

For details, I’ll be driving all the time, so no flights, but budget also shouldn’t be much of a gap to worry about since I came out here for work anyway. I enjoy all types of stuff, from the outdoors to historical stuff and the more fun activity type places, and my top priority is to do some awesome experience, see some amazing things, and have a blast before I head back home!

t3_1fv6h7f,VAT refund Barcelona Airport Experience ,"I’m traveling with my mother in barcelona. I’m flying home earlier than my mother while she continues her travels. She placed all of her purchases under my passport and I am planning to attempt a VAT refund by myself (I will not be taking all items purchased with me, they’re all smaller items and can also claim they are items I already have if they do ask) She said some airports are more relaxed and did not need to show all items when submitting for the refund. How has your experiences been in the past with the Barcelona airport? Did you really need to show all of the items? I’m just planning on checking the items that I’m bringing with me so will do this prior to security. 

I’ve also read some threads that said there are locations in barcelona that stamp the receipts before the airport so you do not need to check the items there. Can you do this before your day of departure and how does that work? Would you suggest this instead?

t3_1fvdalx,Colorado trip?? Advice needed!,"THE TRIP IS SOON NEED ADVICE PLEASE- 

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting. Again, we are really wanting Colorado but I just worry about the altitude sickness. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! "

Im very young obviously so money is scarce, i’ll have enough for the flights, and i’ve made the budget of $1000 for accommodation/food. I plan on staying in cheap hotels / hostels most of the time, with thailand being the only exception as it is so cheap there to book a decent airbnb.

With the months in consideration, i know i might have to remove/add some destinations i just havent thought of yet. Thats were this post comes in!

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
t3_1fv2xqr,Has anyone from outside Germany ever processed a paper DB (Deutsche Bahn) compensation claim?,"So long story short DB owes me some €300 (cancelled trains and overnight stranding). It's been 2 months and all that has happened so far is this:

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point)."

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? "

Planning a trip to Ireland / Scotland.  First time to either country but from the YouTube research, I'll probably be back to see more of the scenery lol.

I was planning to rent a car.  

So my questions are this - which country would you do first?  What are some drives or loops that you would recommend to see the scenery in either country?  Is there any self-led audiotours that someone can do for either country? (Ie like guide along tours or action tour guide apps)

Also, how would you recommend traveling between the 2 countries - from my research, it looks like plane or ferry (if I did ferry, it looks like you can catch a bus between belfast-galway which goes from city center to city center via the ferry)

I haven't done European travel since before CoVID but is there Uber/Lyft/(European equivalent) for taxi service?

t3_1fv2tyc,EU and Schengen travel ban with travel thereafter ,"Hi there. 

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen? 

Exhausted google searches and relevant sites. Any information would be appreciated.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

PS: We are residents of Whitehorse, Yukon and the closest Japanese Consulate Office we have is either Vancouver or Calgary.

t3_1fvcgne,Anyone else notice that Southwest leaves the seatbelt sign on for basically the whole flight? ,"In the past I’ve almost exclusively flown Southwest but lately for various reasons I’ve flown on several other carriers both within the US and internationally. I’ve noticed other airlines like American, United, BA, and Lufthansa all turn their seatbelt sign off before even reaching cruising altitude. This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence. Anyone else notice this?

Edit: for everyone replying “you should keep it on anyway when seated” I 100% agree with you and do that myself. I’m only talking about getting up to use the restroom, grab something from the overhead bin, etc. "

t3_1fumo9j,Thoughts on this - starting your career early vs travelling the world whilst your young,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been pondering this question a lot lately and would love to get some diverse perspectives: Is it better to start your career early or to travel the world while you’re young?

I see the value in both sides and am struggling to decide which path to take. On one hand, I’m keen to establish my career and secure my future. On the other hand, I feel like I might miss out on incredible experiences and personal growth opportunities that come from traveling.

What are your thoughts? Have any of you chosen one path over the other? If so, how did it impact your life? Any advice or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot!

I have a ticket to Bangkok and must go through immigration; however, I am not staying. I am moving onward to Laos. I will be back in Bangkok a week later to go to other parts of Thailand, so I made my main airfare from the US to BKK roundtrip. My other ticket is separate.

I'm not sure which places Ill want to stay in more than others in order to keep my options open. I know you can book open flights but they always seem pretty pricey and I'm not experienced with booking flights last minute. Every other multi trip I've had was rigid. As I'm planning on travelling for 4 months I want to be as flexible as possible. EDIT: Thanks very much for the advice everyone, much appreciated! I think I'll book flights in advance in NA then when I get to Mexico/SA I'll do last min bookings between the countries.  "
t3_1fun8lm,16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

t3_1fuh6qq,Three weeks in Taiwan this November,"1. Is November a good time to go?  Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

Thank you for any advice you are able to give!"
t3_1fueo5c,"Travel Plan from Santa Maria CA, to Las Vegas, to the Grand Canyon","I have this travel plan set for February. I chose this month because in my occupation that's the slowest work month and leaving at that particular time wouldn't be a big burden on the company. And the state I live in gets extremely cold and depressing during that month, so I figured this would be an ideal time to escape. I have this travel plan set for an entire week (Monday through Sunday). 

My plan is to fly to Santa Maria, California. Get a hotel and a rental car. Stay there for about two days, and then drive on out to Las Vegas and stay there for about two or three days, and then end off the trip in Arizona at the Grand Canyon.

t3_1fu7vaf,"Mainly for European travelers but, has anyone had an experience where they are asked for Identification by police or other institutions and could only provide a Drivers’ License?","
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;
Paying for a parking ticket in Verona (through post office);
Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened? Were you fined? Jailed? Were you refused admission or services to something? How were you able to correct the issue?"

Do I go via Shanghai PVG with China Eastern, or via Beijing PEK with Air China? Same price pretty much. But not going via either of these options is more than £500 more.

Main thing I care about is not being delayed and stuck there, and getting my baggage. I'm especially nervous reading how long transit takes in China itself, and apparently delays are more common in Beijing. Has anyone had experiences flying with either on this route? I've searched the sub and found some experiences but not totally on these routes, they vary a lot, and are quite old. How long do I need for transfer? Also, I've heard long transfers of 10hrs or so cause problems with check in, has anyone encountered this?

Also, can you select seats easily? Flying is 6000x more tolerable with a window seat for me."
t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place"

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you."

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

I am relatively inexperienced in the world of Christmas markets, but looking at flights it seems doable.


Has anyone been to Prague Christmas market before? Is there any better timewise? Are the evenings/nights better than day time? 
Is that essential to the ambience/experience, in which case an overnight is needed?

Or is it doable and worth it if only for a day?

(Money and work will make an overnight hard but not completely impossible)



Any other markets that come highly recommended, for a day trip, or at a push a single overnight?

t3_1fv1pgt,British Airways’ lack of Class in Business,"It's always been a bewildering fact that British Airways and other European carriers just use the exact same seats for Business Class as in Economy. It's extremely uncomfortable, very tight leg room, no tv, no entertainment, no extra comforts, and on flights 3-4 hours long it's quite astonishing. They are getting away with a lot here, by charging so much more, basically for nothing, (except for maybe a sandwich or coffee in the lounge if you make it on time there).

t3_1fujtnq,Rabbie's Tours versus self-guided Highlands Roadtrip to see Scotland - experiences?,"My husband and I (both 30, from the US) are planning a late April/Early May trip to Scotland next year for about a week. We're debating on doing self-guided highlands roadtrip, renting a car and everything. I typically enjoy this type of planning but am mentally spent, and open to leaving it in the hands of experts. I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

t3_1fuj9po,Looking for Advice on my Rough St. Lucia Itinerary,"Hi all, my partner and I (man/woman) are planning to do a 7 day trip to St. Lucia this December. The rough plan is as follows:

Arrive at Hewanorra Airport, take a taxi or some form of transport to Castries. Stay for 3 or 4 nights. Couple of beach days, exploring Castries, trying the different food, museums, etc. Maybe a night out at a bar/club if that's even a thing. Possibly take the ferry to Fort de France for a night in Martinique, not sure if this is worth it or how it would work.

Take some form of transport to Soufriere to stay there for the remainder of the trip, so 3 or 4 nights. Beach days, exploring the town, and we want to hike the Gran Piton. Then fly back out through Hewanorra.

Does this make sense as an itinerary? Is there any challenges we may face to look out for? What about lodging and transport? Thank you all for any help."

- chill vibes, but not excessive party vibes (maybe like a Spanish folly beach)
- family friendly (traveling with a 1 year old)
- great food
- safe

Could be anywhere south of the States

t3_1fui5e7,Hawaii Trip Advice,"Hey folks,

I'm traveling to Oahu this Saturday for a wedding. I'll be staying about 10 days, and I was looking for advice. I'll really take any tips and tricks about visiting the island, but mainly I wanted to ask what I should do to be social. I'm a 24 year old guy and will be alone for about half the trip. Are there any places/things I should visit or do to meet people my age? I think I'm pretty good in social situations once I'm actually in them but engaging in that first part and actually putting myself into those situations is always the hardest part. My hope is that I don't default to my usual hermit loner self for the trip. Bars/drinking is usually not my scene, but I am willing to step out of my boundaries if I need to. Any advice is welcome! Thanks!"

I’m a 23-year-old guy planning my first solo trip and trying to decide between London and Manchester. I’m particularly interested in catching a Manchester United game at Old Trafford and checking out some good house music DJs while I’m there.

I’d love your thoughts on the following:

Which city has more to offer for a solo traveler?

Is one city generally cheaper than the other for accommodation, food, and activities?

How easy is it to get around each city and what’s the transportation like between London and Manchester?

Any areas or things to avoid in either city?

Looking forward to your recommendations and insights! Thanks!"

I’m currently living in the Netherlands (since past 7 years), and I’ve renounced my Pakistani nationality few years ago. I’ve traveled to about 35 countries across Europe, Asia, and America, and one destination I’ve always wanted to explore is India. I’ve heard so many wonderful things about the cities, culture, and landscapes from my Indian friends here in the Netherlands, which has made me even more eager to visit. I’ve actually wanted to travel to India for quite some time now, to experience everything I’ve heard about firsthand.

I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into how difficult or easy it might be to get a visa for India as someone of Pakistani origin? Are there any specific restrictions or places I might not be able to visit because of my background?

I’m just looking for any helpful information or experiences regarding the visa process and any potential travel limitations. I would really appreciate your advice. I’m approaching this with the utmost respect and a genuine desire to explore and learn.

Thanks so much in advance for your help!

t3_1ftl7an,Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world."

t3_1fu4hfm,Solo traveler planning Alsace wine + foodie trip 12/2 - 12/5. Recommendations please!,"I'm a 38/F planning a solo trip to Alsace in early December and am trying to figure out my itinerary including where to stay, eat, and the best options for visiting wineries! I'm hoping for some recommendations on how to cut costs where possible and spend more where it counts.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne. Historically I've done semi-private tours but I'd definitely be open to saving money if I can get around by myself either via car or the Kut'Zig - I'm not sure if there are wineries that are easy to access/open to the public or by appointment to someone outside the industry.

I also would love to hit up the Strasbourg Christmas market for maybe an afternoon, but wine, food, and wandering/exploring are higher priorities for this trip vs. more ""touristy"" activities like visiting castles, etc. 

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access. Wherever I stay, I'll mainly be there just to sleep but it's important that it's safe and clean, but would flex for the right experience (again as long as I can make up for added costs elsewhere!) Equally open to hotels or airbnbs.

Thanks in advance!"

* Is Midtown the best to stay for convenience?
* I've got a long list of things to see and do for NY, what about NJ? And can we get there on public transport of should we hire a car?
* I was going to book for February/March time. We're quite comfortable with it being on the cold side and would rather it be chilly with less crowds. I was wondering whether as it is out of season will stuff be closed? Or will we be okay?

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days? 

Budget: im hoping to get the price under 2.000$ just for this week for hotels, food and daily activities.

Since we are probably not going there anytime soon anymore we would like to add as much as possible.

Thanks!"

t3_1fu7qpc,Iberia Missed Connection and Cancelled Flight ,"Hello Everyone, 

Long time lurker and first time poster looking for some guidance please. 

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

t3_1fucwpf,Boarding pass not assigned at check in (online),"Is it just me or have others noticed that there airlines seem less likely to assign a boarding pass when you do online check in? Seems like I always used to check in online, get my boarding pass, and then show up at the airport ready to go.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass. But that means having to go and line up at the  bag drop line and that can take an hour at least. As I have no bags to drop that makes for a very frustrating experience!

  
Edit: this is flights to/from US, UK, France, Netherlands.

This seems like a new frustration and has happened on BA, Air France and KLM on my last few flights.

Is there a trick I am missing here? Let me know if this is just normal nowadays or or if there's something I am doing wrong.

Example airline email:

Dear passenger, 

You have successfully checked in! Please note: We cannot provide you the boarding pass online now, you need to obtain it at the airport.

**How to obtain your boarding pass:**

* Come early to the airport on the day of your flight to make sure you have enough time to obtain your boarding pass.
* Go to a check-in counter, even if you travel with hand baggage only.
* Once all necessary steps are taken, one of our agents will provide you with a boarding pass to go through security checkpoints and to board your flight."
t3_1fu4vb5,Replanning Winter Trip-Virginia? ,"I had a trip booked to Boone NC the week between Xmas and New Years.  I don’t think that will be possible and trying to replan the trip.  There will be 2 kids (5 and 7) that want to play in the snow and do snow tubing.  No one on the trip will be skiing.

We have flights already booked to Charlotte so ideally someplace driving distance.  I’m not familiar with Virginia so maybe someone could point me in the right direction.  

We could change our flight$ if needed but the catch is it has to be someplace that my in laws can fly to direct (they live outside US) so it limits it to Atlanta, Charlotte, NYC, Chicago, Denver, LA, SF.  I know Colorado is a good option but all the big ski towns will be super packed so open to other suggestions not Breck, Vail etc.   "

t3_1fu4o30,What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible. 

I posted on my Instagram story what happened and had 13 ppl reaching out that they went through the same thing with AirSerbia :(((((/ one of my friend who is originally from Belgrade sent me an email address that is at their LOST AND FOUND office door in Belgrade ( ???? ) and after I sent an email there, they responded that my baggage was still in Belgrade ( ???? ). When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!! "

t3_1ft24dp,"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

t3_1ftt2wn,Is it worth staying in a hostel in Kuala Lumpur?,"Hey all,
I'm kicking off a solo adventure around a few spots in SEA with a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and was wondering if its worth staying in a hostel or if I should just go with a regular hotel. Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

To travelers who have been to KL before, is it worth trying to stay in a hostel or should I just play it safe and start off in a hotel? 

Thanks in advance for all your input."

t3_1fu03t7,Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?"

t3_1fst66x,"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me."
t3_1fso6rm,12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

I am looking to use up some vacation time by the end of the year, and am thinking of a november or december trip to scandinavia. I am from canada, so i dont mind the cold (know how to dress for anywhere down to -40C.) i love the idea of visiting old cities when they are blanketed in snow/ christmas vibes.

I am feeling a pull towards the scandinavian countries, would love to see both cities and nature (coastlines, fjords, etc). 

i was wondering how well the infrastructure is maintained in the winter for driving/ trains? ideally i would fly into a main city and rent a car. 

any recomendations?

t3_1fsu2ec,Hotel / Resort fees getting out of control?,"
Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

Anyone have advice about how to avoid getting ripped off?"

We'll have our jogging stroller, which even when folded is likely longer than the dimensions.

My only requests for this trip are trying a NYC hotdog and a slice of pizza (LOL), seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, going to the American Museum of Natural History, and finding some good dessert spots/other eateries. He is not a sweets/sugar person so he has left me in charge of that.

Dates: January 10-12, 2025. We are planning to arrive between 9:30am-10:00am on Friday and depart around 2:00pm on Sunday. 

Stay: we have yet to book the hotel but we will be staying right in Times Square 

What he has discussed booking so far: going to MoMA, American Museum of Natural History, two evening shows (a play off Broadway and the blue man group), either Little Italy or China Town, shopping on 5th avenue, and a few restaurants he really wants me to try as they are favorites of his. 

As this is my first time going, we’re trying to hit some really key spots while also not overwhelming either of us since we really only have 2.5 days there.  If anyone can give any recommendations given the time of the year or other tips, I would greatly appreciate it!

I am looking for tips on some less common but game changing items I can pack to make the trip as good as possible, also things that women might end up needing that they didn't think to pack / would be pleasantly surprised if it magically appeared

t3_1ftqdb8,"I've searched a lot, to arrive Spain (Tarifa or Algeciras) from Morocco (Tangier), still got some questions.","Hi travelers and dear local fellows,

I am planning a trip to Morocco and in my plan, I'll take the ferry from Tangier to Tarifa, then local transportation to Malaga. Simple answer to this route, rather than just fly away, is that I wan to try something fun, and the Strait of Gilbralter is on my checklist as well. The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

However, I'd like to consult your experiences if I should do Tangier-Tarifa or TangierMed-Algeciras. For now I choose Tangier-Tarifa since it's 40-60 min ferry plus 30-50 min bus, shorter than TangierMed-Algeciras with 20-30min ride plus 2.5hr ferry. I will be staying in the town of Tangier, for the eve.

Besides, I am a bit uncertain about the local transportation between Tarifa and Algeciras. Rome2Rio tells me that there are regular bus routs operated by local transportation company. My concern is that what about the fare and how should I pay the ticket? Does it take credit card? or I should buy the ticket somewhere?

After arriving Malaga, I will be staying Malaga for 2 nights and then fly back. Should I book my day tour to Granada and Alhambra?

TIA for all of your sharing."

I wanted to get any feedback on our high level itinerary. We will be arriving Sunday Oct 13th and travelling by train (Swiss Travel Pass). 

We have a pretty good idea of our daily activities but honestly I've tried to avoid planning TOO much which removes free time for exploring. My girlfriend and I like planning the next day the night before, talking to concierge for local recs, etc. Here is what I have: 

Day 1 (Oct 13): PM - arrive late to Montreux from Geneva, dinner. 

Day 2: AM - Walk to Chillon Castle, boat tour if time/weather line up. 
PM: Lavaux vineyards walk (Cully -Saint Saphorin). Dinner there/Montreux. 

Day 3: Gruyeres - chateau du Gruyeres, HR Giger Museum (we are Alien fans lol), etc. Train back to Montreux/dinner 

Day 4: AM - train to Zermatt 
PM - Stellisee lake weather permitting/Zermatt bopping 

Day 5: AM - Early Gornergrat, Riffelsee, proposal 🥳. Matterhorn glacier if time/weather 
PM: BEAUSite spa. Dinner at Omnia. 

Day 6: AM - train to Wengen. 
PM: Mannlichen-kleine schedegg if weather permits/lauterbrunnen valley option 

Day 7: (all options) Murren North face hiking, gimmewald, Eiger Trail, schilthorn, jungfraujoch

Day 8: see day 7. Mix/match accordingly 

Day 9: AM - lauterbrunnen valley 1 last time. Train to Lucerne. 
PM - bop around Lucerne 

Day 10: Lucerne City exploring. Old village, museums, boating weather permitting, etc. 

Day 11: rigi/pilatus/stoos ridge (still deciding - open to suggestions). 

Day 12: AM: train to Zurich (maybe stop in Zug for lunch??). 
PM: bop around Zurich 

Day 13: Zurich exploring, museums etc. 

Day 14: depart 

Weather may dictate some of these days. Have thought about training to Bern on any rainy days or other locations. We are pretty flexible and enjoy both hiking and city exploring. Have lived in Colorado for many years and understand October hiking will be layers, beanies, gloves. 

Any advice is welcome!! "

I’m in a bit of a stressful situation and would appreciate any advice.

However, their applications were denied because I mistakenly answered a question about their health conditions incorrectly.

I’ve since learned that I can reapply for their ESTA applications after 24 hours, but I’m really anxious about whether this will work out.

	1.	Can I submit new applications for them with the same passport numbers, or will their previous denial affect the new applications?
	2.	How can I ensure that I provide the correct information this time?
	3.	Is there a chance that the system will still show them as “not authorized” when I try to reapply?

Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!

Something that's important to me is possibly being able to get assistance. I'm autistic, I can take care of myself so it's not a necessity but it'd help a lot. I know the sunflower lanyard is known with KLM but TAP doesn't seem to be trained with it. I'm not sure if it's known with the domestic airlines in Brazil.

I also have some questions about the São Paulo/Rio airports. What's it like having to switch from international to domestic flights? Do I have to check in all over again, is it far away? Is it easy to find English speaking personnel? This is one of my boyfriends' worries since I don't speak PT very well.

I saw I'd possibly have to do a ""self-transfer"" in Lisbon, what is this like? Also, does anyone know if TAPs prices ever lower again? The price recently got raised and hasn't gone down again.

To me the TAP flights seem easier, times are perfect (good layovers too!), but I'm not sure how reliable they are. I read a lot about baggage rules, but I don't mind putting in extra effort to make sure I'm not going over the limits. To be honest, I'd do that no matter the airline. What would be the best choice in my case? TAP or KLM?"

My mother is traveling to India for an emergency. I looked this up online and the website I posted above popped up.  Very poorly designed, by the way. Looks like it was designed by a 12 year old. 

Anyway, I created her application, uploaded her photo and passport page and paid the $40 USD fee. Less than 24 hours later, saw the visa was granted. 

Is this too good to be true or a scam? I don't want to book her ticket, have her show up at the airport, and this isn't even legit. The Indian embassy is useless here too, as there is no number to call, and if you make an appointment, they can barely speak English or convey anything properly.

So I said great I'm in the right spot. However, both those lines were going on 2 separate buses to the same place. When it came time to scan my ticket the driver said ""this isn't your bus"". I said how? I was told to come to this line and it's going to my destination. He said you missed your bus. And no, I did not come late. I was an hour in half early, my bus literally left minutes before. I asked can he please let me on the bus he said ""how much you got"" and was saying other very rude stuff to me but I digress. I lied and said I only have $20 so I gave him cash for him to let me on the bus. 

I contacted greyhound only wanting to get a partial refund of $20 on my ticket but they are of course saying it's nonrefundable. How is this my fault at all? Their app clearly said get in line D or E and the employee told me line D. The employees didn't even do calls for which bus is going where. You just had to assume what like to get in. 

The bus I got into by minutes managed to get to my destination so I was able to get onto the connecting bus. Which is why I asked for only a partial refund. But do I have grounds for a charge back? "
t3_1ftlx9l,Good hotel chain for solo travelers for collecting benefits/points,"Im thinking of doing some solo traveling in the next year, mostly focused in Europe and USA/Canada.

What hotel chain would you recommend for solo travelers, where you benefit for staying with the same hotel chain over time (like collecting points for free breakfast or discounts), and that they also have decent coverage around Europe and N. America. Also, maybe not too expensive :)

t3_1ft7yj7,Guide for Marrakesh and desert tour,"Hello,

My girlfriend and I are traveling to Marrakesh soon. We were wondering if anyone has a good guide for the city. In addition, we found recommendations here for a 3 day tour from Marrakesh to Fez through the Sahara Desert, but they require 4 people to join and haven't met that minimum yet. If anyone has suggestions for an alternative company I'd appreciate it. Or if anyone wants to do this tour starting on October 7th, let me know. 

If anyone has tips on finding other people to do tours with you, I'd love to hear that as well. "
t3_1ftt5um,Hotel images ,"
I recently traveled to a luxurious hotel in Dubai and booked the room through a well-known OTA application. However, when I arrived at the hotel, the room was completely different from the pictures. I believe they used hotel images that were over a year old. Why don’t these OTAs update hotel images regularly, maybe once a quarter or even monthly? I keep facing the same issue and it’s frustrating to trust hotels through these platforms."

t3_1ft5pl2,7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)"
t3_1ftofd9,Reasons not to fly with Iberia/level as per my recent experience,"
- [ ] No free blankets/headphones/pillow. (Normally this was always complimentary)
- [ ] No water???
- [ ] Kicked and rebooked my flight and sent me a bone chilling “we canceled your flight” email
- [ ] Separated me and my family
- [ ] Spent $20 on unlimited WiFi and booted me after 5 minutes. (Flight attendant says there’s nothing that he could do, many reported the same issue)
- [ ] Website didn’t work much for a refund. Never loaded
- [ ] The free WiFi for messaging didn’t work either
- [ ] Breakfast, lunch, and dinner had to be prepurchased. No complimentary meals
- [ ] Screen displays don’t work on my flight to and from destinations (mind you different planes entirely)
- [ ] When I would press help button to get a flight attendant. 1. It took a whopping half hour and 2. When he came by he didn’t ask us what we could be helped with rather he walked straight passed us and turned off the button without a word exchanged. 
- [ ] 5 hour delay to and from. Ended up spending 10 hours at the airport.
- [ ] Check in booths didn’t start until half hour before boarding even with the 5 hour delay. Still had to rush through the whole process

t3_1fthuuc,Help - Where do I stay if I’m under 21?,"I’m going to New York for vacation, but I’m 20 years old and I recently discovered on Expedia that basically every major hotel in NYC requires you to be 21+ to check in.

The thing is - I’ve been a frequent traveler ever since I started college (18yo), often going on weekend trips and vacations during breaks. I’ve almost always stayed at major hotel chains for these trips (Marriott, Hilton, etc.) and I’ve never once had an issue checking in. How does that work? 

I asked a bunch of other people at my university and they’ve never encountered this before either and just checked in while they were under 21…

t3_1ftju3z,Travel and tobacco question ,"Hi,

I have a question regarding a recent flight I got
From Hong Kong to Melbourne, Australia. 

I attempted to purchase 100 grams of tobacco from Hong Kong airport, well aware of the 25g limit when entering into Australia. 

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

Sincerely,

Highly anxious Male, 26, currently smoking their cigarettes. "
t3_1ftqahj,Is a 5 hour flight then 4 hour train journey doable?,"Hi there.  Is a five hour flight and then a four hour train journey doable without becoming exhausted?

I am suppose to be flying (from Istanbul at 11:50am) to Casablanca Mon, 28 Oct, arriving **14:50** (5h flight duration) and was planning to take a train from Casa airport to Fez (four hours), where I would check-in to a hotel for three nights.

However, I'm now wondering whether this is a bad move.  Should I check-in at a hotel in Casablanca for one night, then travel to Fes the next morning?

Alternatively, if it's during the day (and it is) and I can travel first class by train (and no need to pre-book - just turn up and get the next train - there's one every hour), then should I be okay?

I'd rather go straight to Fes (have nothing to do in Casa), but I don't want to exhaust myself either.

Arrival: BCN 

Direct flight   A300-200 

  
**My parent's flight to Barcelona**

1. they purchased a ticket months ago. One way ticket.

**Problem** 

1. Cancelation  A day before the flight, the initial flight was canceled, and they got re-assigned to a different flight day later. 

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. "

I went to Japan last year and Google Fi was a nightmare. The 'unlimited data' quickly became very, very limited. Very spotty. Very bad overall. On top of this, I have been having a LOT of issues with google support, my support being dropped every single month on renewal so I need to keep reaching out to re-activate it, and it's such a complete bother and mess.

So what I am looking for is:

* A switchable plan to which I can have full unlimited global data support should I need it. A plan that ideally will have fair or really reliable international support.
* A steady plan to use for simple calls and texts, with either cheap or pay-by-use data plans. Or if there's a cheap option that still has data, that's good too.
* A good customer service that's easy to work with.
* A plan that will actually not have these disconnection/renewal problems every month.
* The ability to carry over my number.
* eSims (ideally but not necessary)

I just need to get away from this Google Fi shit. There were too many times I was afraid of being without internet overseas. I want this addressed long before I get another trip planned."

I get that its a level 4 travel advisory and honestly a huge part of my brain is screaming at me to not go but I also don't know if its something I can avoid. My grandmother who spent years in the united states and played a large part in raising both my sister and me moved back to Caracas in 2012/2013ish. She was not here legally and I don't think there is likely any chance of her being allowed back into the united states. She is mostly blind and has a hard time moving around so I also don't think it would be feasible to have her travel elsewhere and meet her somewhere outside of the country. But I am also in tears thinking about not being able to see her at least one last time and I really don't know what to do. I'm scared of being kidnapped or falsely imprisoned or worse. I am white as hell and barely speak Spanish (understand a bit just cant speak much) which absolutely doesn't help. Am I overreacting, or should I try to stomach the fact that it is just not reasonably possible to see her again given the risks?

t3_1fsu1jf,Vienna or Amsterdam as a female solo traveler (in July)?,"Hi! I’m a uni student who’s planning on solo traveling next summer - early July to be specific. 

I would like to visit Vienna or Amsterdam but can’t decide… I need to fly on Lufthansa so it would be Munich-Vienna or Frankfurt-Amsterdam. 

(I’ve been to Munich and Frankfurt and will only spend a day or two so both doesn’t really matter)

I’ve been to Vienna (and other cities in Austria) as well but it was when I was younger, and I think the familiarity would help me on my first ever solo trip. 

I’ve never been to Netherlands, so it would be nice to have a new experience. Plus I will visit Rotterdam as well if I choose this. 

Things I have to consider:

Accommodation - I want clean and safe hotel. Novotel or other 4 star business hotels. But I heard Amsterdam is more expensive than Vienna…

Racism &amp; Overall Safety - I’m an Asian woman so… I never had unpleasant experience in any part of Austria but was wondering about Amsterdam. 

Sightseeing - My visit will be about a week long and won’t move around the country so it would be nice if the city is filled with tourist attractions. 

Any suggestions? Thanks!"

I’ve lost my passport (Canadian) and am still looking to make this event in Spain next week. So would there be alternatives? Train? Police report and other ID?

Thanks!!!"

t3_1ft2ekq,Which of these U.S. cities should I visit for a weekend trip? ,"Hi! 

I'm looking to go with my partner on a weekend trip. We're in our mid twenties. We'll be leaving from the Atlanta area and want to go to a city that is no more than a 4-5 hour drive away. I'm looking for somewhere that has a good amount of things to do; we like to hike and do outdoors thing, good restaurants, cool bars, museums. I'm also looking for a place where an Airbnb or hotel would not be absurdly expensive. I'd also love to see some fall foliage. We really wanted to go to the mountains of NC but I think the hurricane damage might prevent that. 

The places I'm choosing between right now are: 

-Chattanooga TN

-Charleston SC 

-Charlotte NC (not sure if this option is out because of the hurricane damage) 

-Dahlonega GA

-Savannah GA 

Also, if anyone has any recommendations that I haven't thought of, feel free to let me know. Thanks!"
t3_1ft1991,Question on Argentina Tourist Visa entry requirements ,"I plan to travel to Argentina in December and got a tourist visa from the consulate. I hold a passport from India. The validity is from Sep 27 to Dec 26 and maximum stay is 30 days as mentioned in the visa.

My question is: If I enter Buenos Aires on Dec 15th, is the period of allowed stay 30 days from the date of entry (as long as my visa is valid when I enter) or no matter what, my last day of stay in Argentina will be Dec 26 which is the last date of visa validity and I need to leave Argentina on or before Dec 26.

t3_1ft10f6,Mendoza Argentina Recommendations!,"I will be traveling to Argentina this November with my fiance, and we will have 4 full days in Mendoza.  We are debating between two options:

Option # 1: Stay at a vineyard/resort that has a spa and activities like wine tour, horeback riding, etc. all on the resort. More expensive option

  
Option # 2: Stay in a hotel in Mendoza city and take day trips to thermal hot springs, horseback riding, wine tour, etc.

The resort option sounds nice, but I worry about limiting ourselves to the resort itself and not being able to experience some of the more well known restaurants in the city or other activities.

Has anyone traveled to Mendoza before and have any input on whether we should stay in the city and be open to any restaurant/activity we'd like or if it would be better to book one of the resort type options?

  
TL;DR : Should we stay in Mendoza city and take day trips to activities or book an all inclusive resort?

Thank you!"

t3_1ft0zrv,Delayed luggage with LOT in Warsaw,"I wondered if anyone here had experience with delayed luggage with LOT. 
I had a flight from Bucharest to London via Warsaw last night. The flight from Bucharest left late and I barely made the connection to London. I suspected my luggage won’t make it though, which became clear once I got to Heathrow and the luggage wasn’t there. I put a claim immediately. Today, I have tried to speak to someone about it, assuming it’s a simple matter of getting the bags on the next flight.
Everyone at LOT has been extremely unhelpful, they tell me to contact a different number every time and all they say is that the bags are being traced. 

It’s soon 24h since I got to London, and I have no idea where the bags are. I was coming back from a long trip with lots of clothes and personal items in there. 

What are the chances of my bags appearing once we’re past 24h? 

What do I do if they don’t show up in 2-3 days? I have travel insurance but I want LOT to pay as they have been so unhelpful about making the connecting flight or trace my stuff. "

t3_1ft0qw1,Maldives Mafushi dinner at hotel or outside?,"Hey, weird question but Me and my GF (vegetarian) together with her and mine parents are going to Maldives at the end of november for 6nights. We chose Mafushi because it is easy to go for trips from there. We are staying at Kaani Palm Beach hotel but there is option with breakfast or Breakfast + Dinner and we cant decide what to choose? 

From the site i am booking it, it is approximately 30€ per person for the dinner at the hotel (idk if its buffet or Á la carte), but I heard that it is not so expensive in restaurants so we should eat in restaurants outside hotel. I checked few on google and it was around 25€ when I chose most expnesive meals. But maybe someone was there recently, especially in the same hotel maybe, and could give me better info on whats better?

t3_1ft00p7,"8 days in Spain, starting and ending in Madrid - is that enough time to visit another city or should I just stick to Madrid and its surrounding towns?","I’m planning some solo travel around a work trip to Madrid next week and I want to use my time effectively. This will be my first time in Spain and I’m currently torn between two options:

1.	Split my time evenly between Madrid and another city - I’m thinking Barcelona, Valencia, or Seville, or even crossing into Porto (though I’ve been there before)
2.	Stay in Madrid for the full week and take day/overnight trips to surrounding towns (Toledo, Sergovia, Salamanca).

My first day off will be next Friday (11/10) and my flight home from Madrid to London is 3pm the next Saturday (19/10). I’ve heard that 8 days is too much time for Madrid but I’m worried that things will be too rushed if I visit a second city but only spend 4 days in each.

Because of the flight schedule, I must start and end the trip in Madrid. I like walking and street photography, and I can speak basic Spanish. I also want to keep costs low so I’ll probably be staying in hostels for the entire trip.

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations?"
t3_1fszsve,Madeira or Azores (sao Miguel),"Hi Reddit! 
Looking for some insight on where to go in late Dec/early January. Got a group of 8 adults that are an annoyingly difficult mix to plan for.  Half the group can’t swim and want to hike more / adventurous excursions. The other half wants to chill by a heated pool and do nothing basically (they’re not into hikes but would probably be fine with some tours that drive to beautiful views). Also mostly a vegetarian group, not sure on food options for both but assuming Madeira has more variety. The trip would be about 8 days

t3_1fszcqk,Do I Need a Transit Visa for a Long Layover in Frankfurt (Over 24 Hours)?,"Hey everyone,

I have two flights booked for my upcoming trip, and I’m trying to figure out if I need a transit visa for Frankfurt. Here are the details:

* **Flight 1**: Cairo to Frankfurt, arriving at 5:25 AM on October 29th.
* **Flight 2**: Frankfurt to Haneda (Japan), departing at 11:30 AM on October 30th.

That’s more than a 24-hour layover in Frankfurt. Both flights are part of a single itinerary/ticket, not two separate tickets.

I have an Egyptain passport.

My final destination is Japan, and I already have a valid Japanese visa. I’ve checked some visa rules, but it’s still unclear whether the long layover means I need a transit visa.

Has anyone had a similar experience, or can someone clarify if a visa is required for this kind of long layover in Germany?

t3_1ft4exz,Is it a good idea to visit Tbilisi as an East Asian family in late Dec? ,"Hi! Me (F23) and my parents (\~60) are looking to go on a trip for the holidays \~Dec 23-Jan 1 and are really curious about Tbilisi/surrounding areas. Thank you for reading over this slightly long post as I would love to hear from locals/people who have visited before. Would love some pretty honest/frank responses if it isn't a good idea to visit, for whatever reason.

* I haven't really seen a lot online about East Asians visiting Tbilisi, so was wondering if there's any air of hostility towards visitors who are Chinese. We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year. We only speak English (and Chinese but obviously won't be helpful in Georgia!)

Thanks in advance and blessings!"

t3_1fru0rh,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come."
t3_1fswfii,Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia. 

I would love any feedback, location suggestions, or just to hear your favorite places to spend a week! Thanks!!"

Admittedly, I've fallen a bit behind on planning something (I get married in May 2025). My fiance and I have another trip planned in March 2025 (Mexico), so I'm looking at either February or April for when to travel.

Among my friends, we've already done Vegas, Destin, Nashville, Charleston, hometown, and many who have elected to do nothing (multiple elopements and a Covid wedding). It's a group of roughly 10-12 guys. We are all in our early 30s. We're into good food and drinks, games (any kind, I've seen them turn a bottle cap into a drinking game), professional (and unprofessional?) sports, beaches, pools, and water activities. Not big clubbers, golfers, or hikers.

Personally, I love to cook, I like a boat and a lake, to visit an art museum, I tend to be nerdier, and my games of preference are card and board game.

Things that have been batted around in conversation: Ireland (too far for the dads), Montreal, Banff, Lake Tahoe, All Inclusive Resort (don't know where), Lakeside Cabin (don't know where), Austin, Chicago. Not sure if those primers help!

* Dates: February or April 2025
* Locations: Canada, USA, Central America, Caribbean
* Group Details: 10-12, 30ish yo Males, located on East Coast USA
* Vibes: Beers, Good Food, Games/Group Activities, Water (a plus, not necessary)
* Not Vibes: Clubs, Golf Courses, Appalachian Trail

t3_1ft45ni,Where to solo travel for 5 nights in late October for some type I fun?,"I have a week off between jobs and want to make the most of it, but my husband won't be able to join me. I have done some solo travel before and have learned that I'm happiest with small group tasks/activities during the day, otherwise I get a bit aimless and lonely. I am outdoorsy but more into type I versus type II fun. I'm fairly competent on bikes and horses and hikes, but I don't want to summit any mountains and I get lonely camping alone.  I live in a city and prefer nature when I travel.

  
Given all of this and my late October timeframe, any ideas on where to go?  I am on the east coast of the USA and would prefer to remain within a reasonably easy flight (while avoiding any areas that are at a high risk of a hurricane).  I am seriously craving sun after the recent weather here, post Helene.  I can comfortably spend 2-3K on this trip.

We’d love to take a proper break of ca. 3 weeks, but looking for ideas. We’re from the UK and the thought of going somewhere else cold to just “hunker down” sounds awful to me.. I already trapped at home and don’t want to be trapped indoors somewhere else slightly more cosy.

Ideas are either:
A) Somewhere super relaxing but hot so it’s a change and we can go in a pool / chill outdoors. 
In my head this would mean going quite far to say Bali or Mexico…

B) Say f*** it and be those people that take a baby to Japan because I’m dying to go.

C) Road trip round the states
Can’t decide if this is stupid given we can only drive 2 hours before taking breaks with the baby… 

D) Alternative ideas in Europe that avoid a longer flight?!

t3_1ftfa1m,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome."

t3_1fszza8,Anniversary trip - northern lights or safari or ???,"10 year anniversary is coming up and can't decide on a destination. We're leaving our 3yo at home with the grandparents and this might be one of our last kid-free trips. I'm torn between wanting to make the most of it and actually relaxing. Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

Feedback please. Would you choose the northern lights trip knowing that you might not see anything? I think the safari is doable with a teenager but I don't think I would take my kid on a northern lights trip."

I've read that I need approval to bring a drone into Zimbabwe. I think the process is to get approval from the CAAZ and then use that to get a temporary import permit from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.

I have tried several times to contact the CAAZ to get approval and pay the registration fee but have gotten nowhere. I've contacted the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and they've advised me to ""bring all relevant paperwork and apply for an Application for Temporary Importation Privilege"" at the port of entry.

The drone will be in my carry on and I'm not even sure they scan carry on bags on arrival, that said I'd still rather abide by the regulations but they're not making it easy.

My original plan was Argentina but it's so big I don't think I'll be able to do much without feeling like I'm wasting days travelling. But would do Buenos Aries, Iguazu, El Calafate and maybe Barliloche.

However I've also been looking at Nicaragua or Guatemala and Costa Rica. Where would be best to go for the middle of Nov? 

I'll be travelling solo and like a lively atmosphere but also like walks and exploring. Open to all suggestions tbh!"
t3_1fst9w7,3 week US road trip ideas,"Hey all, am hoping to get some route suggestions for a 3 week road trip in 2026 from Chicago - New Orleans/Dallas or Kansas City (at a pinch). 

Firstly, I'm travelling with 2 women who insist we take in the bridges of Madison County - I see these are best visited in Spring . Was thinking of doing the Indy 500 as well and also want to try to squeeze in Memphis/New Orleans and either Dallas or Kansas City (probably prefer Dallas?) for the Fifa Football World Cup (games in these cities scheduled around 14-17 June). Would love to make it to the F1 grand prix in Austin, Texas on 21st June but this may be pushing things.

  
Will most likely hire decent size SUV for the trip and stay in bnb's or the like along the way. Not necessarily attracted to big cities - happy to go off the highway to find local gems along the way. 

  
After the 3 week roadie we will be flying to Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon on the way back down under. 1 male and 2 females in our 50's for context.

  
Hope that's not too long winded of me 😊

  
Any ideas/thoughts/suggestions?"
t3_1ft6jwx,"Help with Expedia, delayed flight by Delta","I'm quite confused, I have an upcoming vacation I booked through Expedia, as it was cheaper. Delta Airlines postponed the flight back to a day later.

Called Expedia and they told me, I'll need to pay to extend the hotel, pay to change airlines. Or pray and hope that Delta will make flight available where it was before.

Feels kinda scummy, shouldn't Expedia cover those type of things? Otherwise I'll need to say in airport for 24 hours on the last day. Which is quite frankly, shitty.

t3_1fsoc62,Vietnam Itinerary Help (13 Nights),"Hi, we will be in Vietnam 13th-26th October (13 nights), we had an idea on where we wanted to go and how many nights to spend in each but when it comes to actually planning it, I am not sure if we should drop Hoi An so it doesn’t feel rushed. We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)
17th: Overnight train to Ninh Binh
18th: Ninh Binh (arrive in morning from train)
19th: Ninh Binh
20th: Return to Hanoi (for Ha Long next morning)
21st: Ha Long Cruise (overnight) 
22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa
25th: Hanoi
26th: Flight home (evening)

This results in a total 5 nights in Hanoi, 2 nights in Hoi An, 2 nights in Ninh Binh, 1 night in Ha Long, 2 nights in Sapa, and 1 on a train. Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

Thanks.

t3_1ft0ar7,"I need some ""comfort"" advice and some ways to up my travel game","I have been travelling a lot the last few years ( 5 cities in canada, Cuba twice, Italy, Portland/San fransisco, Greece, Germany and this coming april, France) and have learned a LOT about efficientcy in packing, my personal travel style and what I need and dont need when I travel.  I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.  Even if I pack clothes for almost every day I am travelling its inevitable you wear something more than once so I figure why even worry about having so much?"

t3_1fsqxf2,Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!"

t3_1fsme5l,NYC itinerary suggestions —no budget,"I’m hoping people can give some suggestions on what activities they would do in NYC if there was no budget (within reason). 

My mother-in-law went through an extremely difficult divorce and lost her house and will be going to NYC with my wife and I this December and we want to make it the most memorable trip possible (and covering all the costs). 

Although I said no budget, we don’t actually have unlimited money so it would only be one of each archetypal activity (museum, play, fine dining, tour(?)). I just don’t want options excluded automatically on the basis of expense. We’re open to something like spending 50% more on the margin for a 10% better experience. 

I was thinking about one fine dining experience, one live show (broadway?), some local cheaper eats (una pizza napolita), one of the art museums (met) but open to any ideas that aren’t usually circulated on the sub for cost reasons. 

Edit:
Adding some suggestions below that have piqued our interest so its easier to track. 

Day 1:

- Dumbo + Brooklyn Bridge
- 2/3 star dinner ( MIL choice)

Day 2:
- Tea service at plaza hotel (near us)
- Spa day on governors island (or shibui spa TBD)

Day 3:
- Museum (transit in brooklyn or met)
- Lunch / offtime pizza at L’industrie
- Rockettes (2x rec so going with it)

Day 4:
- display windows on 5th ave ahead of opera
- Opera (magic flute)

t3_1fsz3l2,What's the 'appropriate' number of photos to take?,"I just got jokingly accused of 'not even traveling' by a coworker after she saw how few photos I took of a recent trip to Atlanta. I was in town for Dragon Con and I took a lot of photos of different booths and lots and lots of the amazing art and even got some taken of me and my travel pal with some amazing actors! But I took very few photos overall. Very few of the city on the two days I went sight seeing and eating at different places. I didn't even get a picture with an online friend who went out of their way to see me :(

I know she said it jokingly, but now I feel a bit of regret. Should I have taken more photos? I'm well-traveled, around the US at least, but I just never really take photos. I know its not important to me to have these photos, but they might actually mean a lot to those I visit or to people who want to see what my trip was like.

So, I need advice! What is the appropriate number of photos I should be taking?? Any particular subjects I should be capturing??"

t3_1fsm1qw,Compare Flighty Vs Tripsy,"Hello everyone,

  
I'm an avid traveler. I usually like to keep my flights tracked through apps. I'm not too concerned with tracking hotel stays or car rental stuff, but it's good when I need it. I usually stay at Hilton hotels and use Avis for car rentals. Unless something unusual makes me deviate from either brand, I'm sticking to them. Flights on the other hand, are usually across many airlines. I like to keep a history of my flights too, just to see where I've been, so I do like the passport feature from Flighty.

I recently discovered Tripsy, I like the UI and I like the general itinerary record. I see that there is a flight/visited record feature, so that's a nice feature. This app reminds me of TripIt. I've used TripIt before, I didn't like the UI though. I didn't like the feel of the TripIt app, but I did love their website, which I ended up using far more than the app. One really great feature, although it's a pro feature, is the expense record keeping of Tripsy. It's really nice to see that immediately and not have to do that on the budgeting app.

I could go on and on about both apps. Again, I've used TripIt, I'm favoring Tripsy out of those two. But what are your thoughts of flight/itenarary keeping of both Flighty and Tripsy? Specifically, I'm thinking of getting a pro membership, so which one feels like you're getting your monies worth?

Look forward to all your responses."
t3_1froz5i,Money comments on having just returned from a trip to the UK.,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks in the UK, mostly touring by train and car. Wonderful trip but I noticed two things I didn't expect.

The UK was expensive! I would rank it right up there with Switzerland. We stayed in three star hotels and B&amp;B's, rated 8.0 or higher on Booking. We paid US$350 per night in London and Edinburgh, US$250 or less in the countryside, breakfast included. Restaurant prices were high too, we paid pound for dollar. Meaning that a pasta dish would cost GBP20, which is US$26. A burger might be GBP16 = US$21. Gasoline cost around US$8.50 per US gallon. Entrance fees for attractions were high, up significantly from the Rick Steve's prices we saw in a four year old book. Like US$40 to see Stonehenge. Museums in London were still free.

British restaurants have caught the tipping disease. They use hand held. point of sale devices for card payments (normal) and the bill almost always included an ""optional service charge"" of 10%. The server would point out that it's optional but there it was, already added into the bill. Incidentally, quite a few restaurants, pubs and deli's are cashless. It was payment by card only. If you go make sure you have a chip card. (Pay toilets in the parks cost 20 pence to use and no longer accept coins. You have to tap your credit card -- chip -- and you're in. It shows up as a 27 cent charge on your CC bill.)

Transportation: The train was expensive too, although we didn't try to book ahead to save money and did walk-up ticket purchases. London to York cost US$94 per person, second class. Car rental was a pleasant surprise. We reserved with Enterprise from the US five months before the trip and were pleased with both the price and the service. And you don't need an Oyster card for the London underground anymore. You can use a chip card in the same way and you get the same fare as with an Oyster card. You just tap in and tap out. No muss, no fuss."

t3_1frdbjj,Brussels is Terrible,"Brussels was... underwhelming 

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels. 

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.  

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert. 

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck. 

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? "
t3_1fslll4,Anyone who has an “M” Visa for China…looking for some advice.,"I’ve been seeing mixed things and want to make sure I do not get denied entry to China or anything when I get there.

On the visa application, it asks if you have ever been convicted of a crime in China or any other country. 

I have an underage DUI charge (misdemeanor) from over ten years ago. 

Initially, I was going to check “Yes” and try my best to do the requirements to get a Visa if I don’t outright get rejected right away. 

Then, after talking to multiple people, the advisement is to check “No”. There is no background check to submit, and China cannot check.

t3_1fsnq7t,Charging US Phones in a Country with 220V Electricity Supply,"I have heard some contradicting opinions. Hoping to get a more clear answer here.

I am travelling to a region where the electricity supply is 220V.

I have a Samsung Galaxy phone. The OEM phone charger is dual voltage 100V - 240V. So no problem there. All I need is a suitable plug adapter so I can plug the OEM charger in their wall socket. 

Then I find a plug adapter on Amazon that has also a built-in USB port in additional to the regular US receptacles. The seller makes it very clear that this is just a plug adapter but not a voltage converter. 

Some people say because the adapter doesn't convert the voltage from 220V to 110V, I should plug your phone into the OEM phone charger (which take either voltage) and then plug the OEM phone charger into the wall socket via the plug adapter.

However, other people say you can skip the OEM phone charger and plug the phone directly into the USB ports using just the USB cord. They claim that even though the adapter isn't a voltage converter but the USB port will only output 5V, so the phone is safe.

Who is correct? Any real life experience?

Another related question:  How about the USB charging ports in the wall plates in the hotels in 220V regions? Is it safe to my US phone directly into these ports?"
t3_1fsjkpr,Destination indecision - thoughts wanted,"Hoping for some insight! Talking a two week trip at the end of November but can’t decide where. Getting close to being too late.

About me:

Traveling alone, single mid 40s male.

East Coast USA based.

Generally I love big cities but I also lean much more towards relaxing more than adventure. Beaches are ok. Hiking does nothing for me.

Which also means I generally don’t like more than 2 cities. 3 at a push. 1 is even fine if there are a bunch of day trips.

Museums are ok. Love street food and foodie stuff (non gourmet) in general.

Love things like replica markets. Love places like Akihabara.

Love animals so something like a town full of deer or monkeys or seeing elephants etc sounds great.

Pretty tall so long haul is hell unless I get a bulk head seat. This makes flights more expensive for me due to buying upgrades to get those seats.

Safety is huge for me. Hence why Colombia or Brazil or something doesn’t really interest me.

Would enjoy some dates while on vacation. At the very least mingling with locals. I love meeting people from different countries.

Destinations I’m considering most:

Asia:
Usually prefer Asia. 

Have been to Japan 3x already. Over a month in Tokyo, couple weeks in Osaka. Have been to Yokohama, Kyoto, Nara, and Kyoto already. I could spend a year in Tokyo honestly. But also feel like I should go see more places which would be Hiroshima, Nagoya, or Hokkaido next, preference wise. I also am conversational in Japanese and have a friend I might be able to see a couple days there. It also feels like a waste to learn Japanese and then not go to Japan. But it also feels silly on the other hand to only ever go to Japan. Catch-22 I guess. 

Philippines. Beaches! Manila looks chaotic but fun. People seem insanely friendly. Cebu area couple be cool. I’ve kind of been scared off of the infrastructure there but I don’t think that’s a huge deal just sort of an annoyance.

Thailand. 3 messages a day sounds great. Easy metro in Bangkok. My favorite type of food is Thai. Amazing looking old ruins and temples. This was my first plan before I started second guessing myself.

Vietnam maybe. Love the food.

However, SE Asia in general is about 30-35 hours each way which one, is insane (Japan is only around 17) and two, I lose two to three days of vacation to planes and airports. I also don’t sleep almost at all on planes so i might be going days without more than a few hours sleep and lose even more vacation time.


Americas:

Costa Rica. Just seems nice. I don’t know.  But is two weeks here too much?

Europe:

Portugal. Have always wanted to go. Looks great. Affordable.  Great food. Also I have a friend who would come see me for a weekend here which could be fun. 

Spain? So many great cities to see like Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastien, etc.

Italy. Would love to see Tuscany and Rome and Naples. Pompeii is a major bucket list place. Great food. Bucket list in general it’s freaking Italy. The ruins, the museums, the food, the countryside, it all just seems great. Same friend that would meet me for a weekend in Portugal would also be willing to meet for a weekend in Italy. 

But I’ve been hemming and hawing for like six weeks now. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m annoying friends by constantly talking about it and changing my preference even multiple times a day. I just cannot make my mind up. So figured I’d get some advice from people that have done a lot of traveling on here. Or even people that haven’t and just have opinions! I have to make a decision soon or I’m gonna screw up and see nothing but way overpriced flights. I’m already getting close to that I feel like.

Any thoughts or help making a decision or advice on the act of making a travel decision, which never used to be this hard I’m not sure why I’m torturing myself this year, is appreciated!"
t3_1fs67vq,How to plan South Africa safari?,"I'm overwhelmed looking at these all-inclusive trip options. Mostly by the cost. We're talking like $10,000 per person from the entry-level ""luxury"" options from the U.S. I really think I just want to do a 3-4 day safari in Kruger or Sabi Sands (or nearby) and would like to do a few days in Cape Town, maybe like 7 - 9 days total. Does anyone have recommendations? I'd be fine with an all inclusive, all out luxury safari option for 3-4K per person for 3 days, but I think I can probably do Cape Town on my own. Am I looking at this wrong or do you really need to budget 7-9K as the minimum to even get down there?

  
I don't even know where to start."
t3_1fseezq,Looking for ways to travel while I work remotely,"Hi all,

I’ve been working from home for a few years now. When I started working remotely the goal was to travel to different places while also working during the day, then explore on weekends and after work. My current remote job is based out of a hospital in Boston. We are allowed to encrypt our personal laptops but we are told to not use them for long periods of time.. they don’t give us work lap tops, I only have a big monitor which I cannot travel with. I’m curious to know how others may be doing this. I feel like giving us the option to be remote but then not let us have the freedom that comes with it defeats the purpose a little bit! 

I do have a little black box that plugs into my monitor (not sure of what to call it lol).. is there a smaller more portable screen I can buy and plug that into? It’s a Dell! 

Please let me know if you need me to clarify anything further!! Thank you! "
t3_1fsmxui,Did I screw up on my Vietnamese visa application?,"I have applied for my Vietnamese tourism visa, and I feel it's logical to apply for the visa before booking a flight into the country. It's my understanding that you are required to show proof of plans to leave the country upon entry. On the visa application I wrote that I would be leaving the country via Ho Chi Min city airport, however, I'm now realizing that I'd rather take a bus into Phnom Penh, Cambodia because it is less expensive and not an insanely long bus ride. Will this be an issue for me?"
t3_1fsmw2g,What to do with about three extra weeks in SE Asia?,"I am going to be solo backpacking around SEA from January to April, starting by looping northern Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. I'll be getting back to Bangkok in mid March and then I'll have about 4 weeks before I fly to New Delhi (from wherever I end up at)

I was initially planning to go down to Phuket briefly to check out Khao Sok for a few days and then use Koh Lanta as my base to check out the Thai islands for about 10 days since Phuket just doesn't sound like my thing. Afterwards I would go to Singapore for a few days and then Malaysia for just under 2 weeks.

However, Western Malaysia is supposed to be super wet in April and I've already been to jungles in central America and will in Vietnam and Thailand as well, so I don't know if it will be worth it. I'm also not sure if there will be enough to do without breaking the bank to spend 10 days on Koh Lanta, so I may have anywhere from 8-16 extra days to do something that is a cheap plane ride from Phuket/Singapore/KL.

I'm currently only going to be spending about 7/8 days in Cambodia between Siem Reap + PP and their surroundings, so I could theoretically add some time here. I'm also interested in Bali (less so after hearing about how touristy it is), eastern Malaysia, anywhere I can climb big mountains without having to pay for a guide, nice beaches (preferably with  waves of like 3-6ft, but I'm happy with anything)

Any recommendations for places to go or things to check out?

Would Teman Negara/Cameron Highlands be worth it when wet? Would 2/3 weeks of (cheaper) islands get boring? Any advice would be appreciated!"
t3_1fsdqyz,Icelandair vs British Airways for long haul flight?,"We’re taking our three kids (10, 8, and 5) to Italy next summer to visit family. We live on the west coast of the US so unfortunately there are no direct flights. *edit: point of origin is Seattle.

I’ve flown to Europe a number of times, but never with my kids. Flight prices are going to be high (around 9k for the five of us). Icelandair will be a little less expensive, and with a shorter layover in Reykjavik (1.5 hours).

Any thoughts/opinions on flying on one airline vs the other for a family would be appreciated!"
t3_1fsaeqn,CA to Vietnam to India in 2.5 weeks? Is this too ambitious? Or not ambitious enough?,"I need to be in Mumbai/Pune (India) for work for a week.

On the way there, I am planning 5-6 days in Vietnam (flying into Ho Chi Minh City from San Francisco). I have friends (of friends) there and in Hanoi, but because of the many other stops involved in the trip, I'm considering only staying in the south.

From Ho Chi Minh City, I'm planning on flying into Kerala (specifically, Thiruvananthapuram / Trivandrum) or Goa (or another rec you all may have?) for 3 days. Then flying into Mumbai/Pune for the work trip for 6 days, maybe an extra day in Mumbai for sights.

I might do a 1-2 day layover in Japan on the way back, or just fly from Mumbai to San Francisco directly. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed at the thought of either.

Altogether it would be about 2.5 weeks of travel. Does any part feel too ambitious? Or not ambitious enough? I'm getting mixed advice from the two people I asked."

We’re open to flying and some travel from an airport via rental car to a secondary destination, but would probably stray away from a road-trip. We’ve entertained the idea of renting a large house together or staying in a hotel with separate rooms; really, anything is on the table!

t3_1fs9ju6,Visiting Miami from Ireland at the End of October – Any Tips/Suggestions for My 6-Day Itinerary?,"\*\*Dia duit mo chairde!\*\* (That's ""Hello my friends!"" in Irish)

As the title suggests, I will visit your fine city at the end of October. I'm really looking forward to the trip as it will be my first time in Miami, albeit I've been to Florida (Daytona, Tampa and Orlando) when I was younger.

Although there's a small group of us travelling, we each arrive on different days, which has given me plenty of time in advance to draw up a plan of things I'd like to see and do. I've also booked some activities in advance.

If you'd be so kind, I'd like the people of this subreddit to review my itinerary, offer some suggestions of things I should add or remove, provide some general advice about the city and overall, provide some constructive feedback. This trip wasn't cheap, and Miami is a city I've always wanted to see, so I want to ensure it goes as well as possible! The primary reason I'm travelling is to see my favourite NFL team (The Arizona Cardinals) take on your Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.

I've reviewed some tourism posts within this subreddit over the past few months and have also come across some fantastic suggestions from users, so thank you for that!

Below, I'll try and go into as much detail as possible regarding what I plan to do over the six days. Please also forgive me in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors I may have mistyped. I've been reviewing this post for about an hour to make sure it's perfect (This is my third read-through..). Anyway, I hope this post doesn't end up too long, boring or deleted by the Mods. So without further ado, please see below:

# Day 1 - Coral Gables

I arrive at Miami International Airport at 5:30 PM and will have to go through immigration. I hope this doesn't take too long! From there, I plan to take an Uber or Lyft to my accommodation. This should only take about 15-20 minutes according to Google Maps.

Once checked into my hotel in West Flagler, the plan is to take an Uber or Lyft to the Coral Gables area to explore some bars. Clubbing isn't my scene, so dive bars where I can watch sports and talk to people are right up my street. (Is this called a 'Dive bar?')

I'm going to a bar called... ""The Bar"" followed by John Martin's Irish bar. If I have the time, I might go to Tap42 bar. I also think I'll stick to bottles of beer while in Miami, as I don't want to end up a sloppy drunk. I like Miller and Bud Light, which I think most bars in the city provide.

After, It's another Uber/Lyft to Se7as bar, which looks like great fun according to Google. Since I'm Irish, I then plan to visit Duffy's Tavern - which looks like such a chill spot.

And that's about as exciting as Day 1 gets! It will probably be after 7 PM by the time I get to leave the hotel, and I'll probably be tired after travelling by air all day. As for food, I'll eat in one or two of the bars.

# Day 2 -Little Havana and Downtown

If I've time, I'll visit a grocery store to pick up a few snacks. The hotel provides plenty, but I'll still make the visit for a basic shop.

I'll then head to Little Havana (I'll walk if I'm okay for time) as I've booked a Walking Tour which embraces you in Cuban Culture. It also brings you to places where Cuban Cigars are made, Cuban Food and a lesson on some historic Cuban sites. Looking forward to it!

Once this is done. I might stick around the neighbourhood to explore it a little more, but eventually, I need to get to the Downtown (I'll most likely walk) area as I've booked a Cruise from Sunset to darkness. This should last about an hour.

Once done, I'll explore downtown. I've noted that I should visit Over/Under, Mama Tried and The Lost Boy venues for a drink and some food. Thankfully these are located near to each other.

Once tired, it's an Uber/Lyft home.

# Day 3 - Wynwood, Biscayne Bay and Miami vs FSU in Hard Rock

Uber/Lyft again, this time to see the Wynwood walls. I booked a tour for about $15 and it takes about an hour. Looking forward to it! I had considered buying a ticket for the Buggy Tour, but it was $50, maybe it's worth it?

I'll then visit Gramps Bar for a bite to eat and a bottle of beer.

Walk to the Museum of Hip-Hop. I'm a big Hip-Hop fan, so getting to visit this should be great! I haven't bought a ticket yet, I think it's about $15. I'm also considering visiting the Museum of Graffiti. I'm undecided since the walls will already contain plenty of artwork.

Uber/Lyft to Biscayne Bay and visit Flannigans, which I know is a meme on this Subreddit. I think it's the Rib Rolls I have to try. Anyway, I'll watch the NCAAF games while I'm there as it's not too far from Hard Rock Stadium and have a beer or two.

Uber/Lyft to the stadium. I'm banking on this game being a late kickoff, but FSU doesn't look good at all, and the Miami Hurricanes do. I've a feeling it may be a 3:30 PM kickoff which means I'll have to alter my plans for the day entirely. My seat is at Midfield, in the nose bleeds, but close to the front of the section. It's the Hurricanes' sideline, so no sun issues regardless of kick-off time.

I was at the Georgia Tech and FSU game in Dublin, Ireland and purchased an FSU T-shirt. It's Irish branded and has the team's logo, will I be okay wearing this T-shirt or will it cause trouble? I'm hoping it'll be a conversation starter with people on the day. I'm looking forward to seeing the Miami team, the QB Cam Ward has impressed me over the past 2 weeks.

Once the game is done, I'll have to head back to the hotel. This might be an issue of traffic, but I have an early start on Sunday.

# Day 4 - Dolphins vs Cardinals in Hard Rock

It's an Uber/Lyft to the Miami Dolphins Tailgate near the stadium. A friend who lives there has kindly invited us along. This means I'll need to be there from around 10 AM to 10:30 AM.

Meet my buddies at the tailgate, enjoy it and enter the stadium for the game.

Here's the kicker, I'm on the side where the sun beams down. I read so much advice that I shouldn't do this, but I got a great offer on a seat at midfield so close to the field and I'm on the Cardinal sideline. Other options were in Row Z of the Dolphin sideline and cost more money. I am not sitting with my buddies, but that's okay.

After the game, the evening is wide open. I'm going to do whatever my friends want to do, which means probably going to Mid-Beach or South Beach to watch the evening games in a bar. This will be costly, but it's only one evening.

When it's home time, Uber/Lyft of course.

# Day 5 - South, Mid and North Beach, followed by Heat vs Pistons

When I decide to crawl out of bed with probably a hangover, I plan to visit the island. I plan to start from the bottom (South Pointe Park) and walk northwards for the day. Google Maps says this is doable in a few hours, but I have until 7 PM with pit stops here and there, so I'm in no hurry.

Maybe I'll rent a bike to explore South Pointe Park?

So, I've drawn up a list of sights I should see along the way on my walk, starting south and moving north, please see below:

1. South Pointe Park
2. Visit Ted's Hideaway
3. Miami Beach Boardwalk
4. Ocean Drive and Art Deco
5. Flamingo/Hummus
6. Mac's Club Deuce
7. Espanola Way
8. The Abbey Bar
9. Collins Avenue
10. Holocaust Memorial
11. Sunset Harbour (Maybe?)
12. Lost Weekend Bar (Maybe?)

Once that is all said and done, it's an Uber/Lyft to the Kaseya Arena for the Miami Heat and Detroit Pistons game. I'm sat pretty high up and far back, but hopefully I enjoy the game. Basketball is a sport I loved when I was younger, I even supported the Heat because Dwayne Wade was my favourite player, so it's a pleasure to get to see the team, live!

After that, it's home to bed.

# Day 6 - Advice Needed, No plans made as of yet

I'm considering either travelling to Fort Lauderdale or to the Miami Everglades, but honestly I am totally undecided. I'm open to any other suggestions from you locals, as well!

The Everglades was my original plan, but 2 people have told me it wasn't that good. I'd be doing the typical tourist thing - boat ride, a wildlife show etc.

Fort Lauderdale looks fabulous from the pictures I've seen online. I will have to travel there by train, though. When there, I think I'll do a cruise which lasts an hour or two.

# Day 7 - Hop on/Hop off Bus Tour, Airport and Home to Ireland

I've decided on going with the bus tour so I can take in the sights one final time and stop off at some places which I never got to see over the 6 days. I'm lucky that my bag will be stored away somewhere safe, so I won't need to worry about it until it's time to go to the airport.

My flight is at 10PM, so I have the entire day to see everything one final time.

# Other things I feel I should add

I've stumbled upon a list (Sorry, I've saved this post as a draft twice now) I curated with questions I'd like to ask locals. Please see below:

* What food should I get in Flannigan's? Rib Rolls or something else?
* I'm not a big beach guy, meaning I won't be going swimming. However, I will of course take a trip to the beach for the sights, to take photographs and all that.
* I wouldn't mind trying Argentinian food. Are there any good spots? I don't want to break the bank either, just try some Argentinian beef!
* Could someone recommend a good sports store? Basically, a big store which sells MLB, NHL, MLS and to a lesser extent NFL merchandise but not limited to Miami based teams... If such a place even exists!

I really can't think of what else to add right now. I just want to make sure I get this post to be right (Please don't delete AutoBot..). I'm not stressing about the trip or anything, I'm just looking to make sure I see/do as much as I can while there. If you've made it this far into the post, I sincerely thank you for reading and hopefully you have some feedback for me.

Looking forward to visiting!"

t3_1fsde26,Road trip in November,"Hi travellers, I would appreciate your advice! :)

I am planning a trip to Europe at the end of November. I want a trip that will involve being in nature, taking a car and travelling distances, occasionally visiting cities and staying there, but mainly being on the road and remote. Europe in winter is cold, rainy and very wet, but at the moment this is the continent I can visit, therefore I was hoping to get your advice on places that one can go to, and manage around the cold and generally gloomy weather. 

  
I was thinking of Scotland and Ireland, but I am afraid it could be too off-season. I am honestly open to other suggestions, I just wish someone with some experience could let me know if road trips are feasible and enjoyable in Europe around wintertime and if so, where?

  
Thank you so much for your comments and advice.

t3_1fs51lk,1 week in Peru: MP and Manu NP? Budget-friendly trip,"Husband and I have one week in Peru. I'll be in Tambopata for work for a week, and then we're meeting in Cusco and have a week together. We wanted to see Machu Picchu and Manu National Park (since I'll already have been in Tambopata region and he really wants to see the Amazon.)

We will meet at Cusco airport around 15:00 on 9 November, and then we have a flight back to Lima at 18:45 on 16 November (to then depart back to the US). Neither of us will be checking any bags; just carry-on size (\~40L) backpacks.

Some folks from my work thing are booking a Cusco - MP - Cusco all in one day tour, but at $400 USD pp, it felt pretty steep to us. I'm hoping to put together a more budget-friendly plan.

Does it make sense to:

* Book ahead and take the 16:30 Bus + Train from Wanchaq to Aguascalientes (""Machu Picchu station"") on 9 November ($52pp)

* Book a ho(s)tel in AC for 9 Nov
* Try and find a guide in AC on the day, to take us up to MP on Circuit 2 on 10 November
* Book transit ahead and go back to Cusco on 10 November
* Book accommodation in Cusco for 10 November
* Try and find a tour, in Cusco, on 11 November to take us to Manu, likely leaving in the early AM 12 November and returning 15 November?

Any recommendations on tour companies for Manu?

The last one is notable for being about $200 cheaper pp than most of the rest of them, which is great but also curious...

Is it feasible to see MP and Manu in one trip?

Are we missing something critical if we only do those two, if we only have a week?

t3_1fsd0za,Transfer time for LAX,"Hello,

In a few months, I will be flying internationally for the first time. On December 28th, I will be flying out of SMF and into LAX with my brother via Southwest to transfer to terminal 7 and leave LAX on my international flight.

My SMF -&gt; LAX Flight is scheduled to be from 6:45AM to 8:20AM, to which then my second flight leaves at 11:30AM. These two flights are booked on separate tickets, and in every other connection I have more than enough time to transfer without any worry (the LAX to SMF return flight has a 6+ hour layover).

I'm aware that the terminal I would be arriving in LAX at, Southwest, is at the opposite side of where the United terminal lies, and that I additionally will need to collect and recheck baggage in my 3 hour window. Regardless, is this enough time to make it to my flight?

If I estimate that the flight is \~40 minutes delayed (meaning I am off the plane around 9AM), baggage collection takes \~30 minutes, and we take the \~15 minute walk outside of the airport to cross straight from Southwest to the United terminal (Both my brother and I are able to walk pretty quickly, there's no concern over exhaustion or anything), that would get us depositing luggage around 10AM (+15 minutes accounting for anything else). Then, we would have to get through security and be at the terminal within the remaining time.

I understand that this is a pretty optimistic timeline, and it should also be considered both that this will be early/late morning as well as extremely close to New Years where travel is likely going to be more frequent. With all that in mind, how risky is this decision? This is the earliest direct flight to LAX from SMF we could get.

Thank you!"

Most my question is in the title. Essentially i am going on a trip with several family members in 2 weeks. We have booked the flight some time ago, but unfortunately one of my family has broken her leg recently and probably won't be able to come along with us.

I am not salty about the money and don't need a refund here. I just want to know for sure how best to proceed since i am worried we might be stuck waiting for a passenger who is not going to show up or something.

Also another question, if her leg does recover until our trip, she will still need to take some injections daily for another 6 or so weeks. She takes them herself. 

We have already spoken to our doctor about getting a note for them, but i don't know if they need to be in some sort of special packaging or if they have to be checked in or if they can be in cabin luggage etc...

Does anyone have some experiences or answers for me? Flight would be inside schengen area.

t3_1fs6nwq,"Barcelona, Seville &amp; Lisbon with 4 month old in November ","
Hi everyone!

Me (29F), my husband (30M)  are headed to Spain and Portugal with our daughter(4 months) in November (approx Nov 9-18 depending on flights). Though I know Spain and Portugal could easily be over 2 months each, we are hoping to do both in the 9-10 days we have, spending just a few days in each city we stop. 

I have searched through google and various threads for ideas and inspiration, but keep running in circles, especially re: ensuring activities and itinerary is baby safe. 

Few notes before I get into the itinerary and questions: 
- we are trying to keep the number of cities to a minimum, this way we have adequate time in each and don’t have to subject baby to too much extra travel
- Not sure if we should do Seville or Granada (or both?)
- We chose Barcelona and Lisbon as our entry and exit countries as they are significantly cheaper for us to fly in and out of.  That said we are open to switching to starting with Lisbon and ending with Barcelona if that’s better.  Willing to shorten time in Barcelona to lengthen time in Seville/Granada
- We greatly prefer culture experiences over general touristy things. Similarly, though we’d love to look at a museum or two, after awhile they all start to look very similar, so would like to keep the general sightseeing of museums and similar things to a minimum
- We would really like to do at least one wine tasting likely near Barcelona. 
- Prefer small tour groups (private or semi-private), and may not be bringing a car seat, so will need to either have a company provide one or not need it 
- baby is breast-feeding, but will take a bottle. I will bring my pumps this way I can enjoy the occasional glass of wine, especially on the winery tour. Will need to pick up more diapers and wipes along the way though
- We also want to try to dip our toes in as many oceans/seas as we can :)

With that out of the way, our current itinerary looks as follows. Please let me know what you think for things to do in each area if we should change and add another city between Barcelona and Seville, and hotel recommendations or places to avoid. Also open to any suggestion suggestions for bringing 4 month old to each of these cities and travelling in general. Thanks in advance!

days 1-3 - Barcelona
- Hoping to do a day tour up to Montserrat for a wine tour
- Would like to dip our toes in the Balearic sea (swimming not required or expected given it’s winter)

Day 3 or 4: train from Barcelona to Seville or Granada

Days 4-7: Seville or Granada
- Maybe a cooking class?
- Would like to dip our toes in the Alboran sea if possible

Day 7 or 8: travel to Lisbon

Days 8-10: Lisbon
- maybe a wine tour or ceramic tile class

* Varanasi

Less pain pulling them due to wrist location. I end up pulling the 4 wheeled ones like a 2 wheel anyway so wheels wear down quickly. 2 wheeled are more stable when stationary too.

Don't see any benefit of a 4 wheeled unless it's small and around an airport."

t3_1fs7nzs,What kind of tap water filter should I buy? (under 20€ if possible),"Hello guys,
I frequently travel to Spain to visit my long distance boyfriend and their tap water is known to not be very good for oral consumption. I have a set skincare routine to wash my face morning and evening due to me having oily and acne-prone skin and I am afraid that the quality and/or hardness of the water will disrupt my skin barrier in the long run.
So what kind of water filter should I buy? I am thinking about those that you can attach onto the tap itself so that the water will be filtered as it comes out, the ones you see on the skincare side of TikTok for example.
Any recommendations? _(should ideally be 20€ or below, as mentioned in the title)_

Thank you in advance! :)"
t3_1frxftu,Contact info removed from luggage tag?,"Hi, all! I tried googling this to minimal success but it struck me as odd enough that I figured I’d ask here.

I had a United States domestic round trip (SAN to AUS and back, both nonstop) in the past week on Southwest. I checked a single bag through the kiosks, quick and painless, nothing in there except for clothing and toiletries. I have a luggage tag on the bag, and you have to fully undo the luggage tag to put the piece of paper with the contact info on it into the tag. When I picked it up from the baggage carousel in AUS, the contact info paper was missing, but the luggage tag was still attached, which means someone had to take the tag off, take the contact paper out, and put the tag back on. There was no TSA inspection slip in the luggage. 

Is this normal? Does anyone have any idea on why/where this would be done? I can’t think of a reason for it, and nobody except for me and airline/airport/security staff had the opportunity to touch it. Sorry if this is silly, it’s just a persisting curiosity."

It looks absolutely beautiful and we really want to go, however, I’ve read a few things online saying it’s not necessarily ‘safe’ to travel to. Says theft / burglaries are common, we wouldn’t wear any expensive clothing or draw attention to ourselves. Also says that SA is common - but I’m travelling with my boyfriend so I hope we’d therefore be ok? 

I just wondered how true this is? We’d obviously be safe as we can, diligent etc, and I’m going with my boyfriend so it is a different sort of holiday. We would be at the hotel most of the time, but we would want to venture out and see the beautiful Jamaica too!

t3_1fs67vc,Flight Cancellation - Re-imbursement of Expenses and Compensation Question,"I am a Canadian traveller who was in Venice.

On September 21, 2024, I was informed by email at 7:00PM that my flight was cancelled with RyanAir flight number FR782. The flight was supposed to flyout September 24, 2024 which is less than 7 days notice. The flight cancellation was due to a third party strike.

As I am a Canadian, I was unable to phone RyanAir to find a new flight without incurring roaming charges and when I saw the cancellation email that same evening, RyanAir customer service was closed. I then rebooked a flight using an alternative airline that costed double the price of my original flight as this was the most reasonable flight out of Venice that I could find under short notice.

I have read the EU airline passenger regulations. I understand that the flight was cancelled due to a third party strike so I am not entitled to any compensation, however, I am unclear if RyanAir is required to reimburse me for the new flight booked. I have not requested a refund yet from RyanAir. It says that RyanAir is supposed to find alternative arrangements, but if they are unable to, then I am required to find the arrangements and submit expenses for reimbursement, however, as I did not contact RyanAir first, am I only entitled to have a refund of the original RyanAir flight?"

I booked accommodation at a 5 star hotel down there and I've received a message to say that I must provide advance payment a day before travel otherwise I'll have my reservation cancelled. 

They've sent bank details for me to transfer to and although they are a known and established hotel (Roseate House in Delhi Aerocity) , this makes me a bit nervous. 

I know that if anything goes tits up in any manner, I'm going to struggle to get the bank to help me / have no protection because I made a bank transfer and didn't use a debit card/credit card to make the payment.

Travelling to the USA (Boston, Ma) in a couple of days and I am a bodybuilder, I'm doing my trt shot the day I leave so no concerns with taking in testosterone as I won't need it. However I take telmisartan/cialis/arimidex all with no prescription. I am travelling from the UK. 

I wondered if the 3 medications listed were okay to bring in or whether I am gonna land myself in hot water. Telmisartan is a BP med, cialis is for ED but I use for BP management as well and arimidex is in case of increase in estrogen. I am only taking enough for the 14 days I'm there but like I say I am concerned if they are prohibited or not? Remembering I don't have a script.

t3_1frt84d,7 Nights for San Francisco and Los Angeles?,"Hey,

I am undertaking a multi-city US tour from Toronto and I was hoping to add San Francisco and Los Angeles to my itinerary in this particular order:  

Boston (2 nights), NYC (7 nights with a day trip to Washington DC), Las Vegas (5 nights with trips to the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam), San Francisco (2 or 3 nights), Los Angeles (4 or 5 nights), and Chicago (3 nights).

I will be flying from NYC to Las Vegas and then, hopefully, from Las Vegas to San Francisco. 

How many nights should I allocate for San Francisco and Los Angeles? I'm thinking of the following:

**San Francisco:**

Day 1: Arrive from Las Vegas, hotel check-in, city tour including the Golden Gate Bridge, dinner somewhere with a view of said Golden Gate Bridge

Day 2: Yosemite and Giant Sequoias Hike Group Tour

Day 3: Road trip. Rent a car and drive towards Carmel-By-The-Sea and Monterry or undergo a Napa Valley tour. 

**Los Angeles:**

Day 1:  Fly in from San Francisco, pick up a rental car from Los Angeles airport, hotel check-in, scenic drive to Malibu and Santa Monica

Day 2: Hollywood Heights, Beverely Hills, Venice Beach, Sunset Strip  

Day 3: Theme park visit (what would you recommend picking?), along with other LA attractions (Griffith Obsevatory, Warner Brothers Studio Tour)

Day 3: Road trip to Irvine for a family visit

Day 4: Road trip to San Diego (I enjoy driving)

What are your opinions on the above? Should I exclude either or both San Francisco and Los Angeles? It would be a waste to do so since Las Vegas is so close to both cities.

t3_1fs5tqz,Wine in Europe - summarize some differences for me!,"We all know about how some countries are “known for their wine”. Italian wine, French wine, Greek wine, Portuguese wine to name some of the big ones I’ve heard of.

Is there something fundamentally different region to region about each country’s wine? I am very much not a wine connoisseur but I do love almost every wine I’ve ever tried! But for example: French wine vs Italian. They’re both known to be good but with sooooo many variations of wine styles, is there anything to actually distinguish them from each other in terms of what they’re known for in the region? Like one is known for more earthy tones, one is better for more citrus flavors etc (?)

Can someone more well versed in this summarize what to look for in each region?"

We are 4 friends, two couples, who wants to do some island hopping tours, see best places and occasionally get drunk. 
I am currently doing some research and I see Bohol and Boracay are mentioned as overrated and some people who visited Boracay even left early. I figured two weeks is not much in Philippines so I am thinking about spending quite some time in El Nido and Cebu. Coron is also mentioned as very similar as El Nido but maybe to reduce travel we could visit it with the boat like a daytrip.

t3_1fr1w7q,What US airline would you pick to build loyalty?,"Hi all, I started a semi-new job a bit ago and have been traveling semi-frequently, averaging 2 RT per month.  This year I've bounced around on different airlines, but haven't earned any status since I spread out the flights across different companies.  Looking into next year, I'd like to establish a primary airline and suspect I'll be able to earn at least the first level/tier of status. 

With that being said, I'm curious what US airline you would choose to build loyalty with?  I understand that this can vary based on your home airport and where the majority of your travel is to/from so I have the below:

* My home airport is LAX - So Delta, AA, United, and SW would all work.  These are the primary choices for airlines I see for my flights and flew this past year.
* My work travel is 95% in the lower 48 with the occasional trip to Canada.
* My travel destinations vary, so that isn't a primary deciding factor.
* My work travel is in Economy, primarily booked through Concur on a company card, so no CC perks to maximize.
* About 1x/year, I make a vacation trip to Europe.  Ideally this is in Business class for the long haul.  If I have status with an airline/group, it could be helpful.
* I have the regular AmEx Platinum, which gets me some benefits for lounge access at Priority Pass, and at Delta lounges.

Then went to Battambang via bus, which even though is the second largest city in the country, is ignored by most tourists. Spent a couple of days there and it was wonderful. A lot of culture, some gruesome history (killing caves) and wonderful nature! Watching thousands and thousands of Bats flying out of a cave was a one of a kind travel experience! 

Then took a bus to Phnom Penh, the capital. Spent about 3 days there. Pretty nice! The temples, grand palace and the museums were the highlights. 

Before flying out of Phnom Penh back to India, visited the Koh Rong Sanloem Islands which were so vast and empty! Few tourists and nothing else. Some of the most secluded beaches we've ever been to. 

Overall, one of my favourite travels across 10 countries till now! Hope more people visit this beautiful place. Open to any questions 😊

t3_1frqh1a,Which airline app to check in on?,"Hi all, would especially love input from any United or Air Canada ticketing agents or folks who flies Air Canada and United with similar segments regularly.

My partner booked a reward round-trip flight via Amex Travel to Edinburgh on a combo of United and Air Canada aircraft. Every flight outbound and home bound on the Amex Travel site shows only the United confirmation number and flight numbers. I was able to get the Air Canada confirmation number by looking up his reservation on United.com

Flights to Edinburgh:
IND - EWR (Operated United Express)
EWR-EDI (Operated by United)

Flights home:
EDI - YYZ (Operated by Air Canada)
YYZ -IND (Operated by Air Canada Jazz)

We know he can check in online and get boarding passes in the United app for the outbound part, but was unsure if he would need to check in on the Air Canada app instead for the flights home since they are both operated by Air Canada.

Is anyone able to provide clarity?

t3_1fs0yyx,What's the allure of the golden triangle of India besides Taj Mahal?,"As an indian, who has done it all I found it very anti-climactic and exhausting. The golden triangle represents the worst of Indian tourist traps. I understand the perspective of poverty porn for some people who wish to feel better about themselves and visit the old part of delhi which is imo a horrible place for travel unfit for international tourists. However, it seems incredibly masochistic to subject yourself to the torture. Furthermore, people get discouraged by their bad experiences and get so demotivated that they leave halfway without seeing the more beautiful parts of India. Delhi belly is not even something that only happens to international tourists. I got the runs within 4 days of arriving in Delhi. I am genuinely curious because there are established tourism infrastructures around the other parts of India as well. IT'S not like the golden triangle is the only well connected route for travel. if you go to the South you have the Nilgiri hills, Malabar coast and the religious temple route. If you go to the Northeast you have tea gardens and various nature spots. if you go further North you have the Srinagar, Kashmir; Leh, ladakh and the Dehradun, Uttarakhand route. Similar routes for East and West. These routes literally take less than a week to travel through and are quite easy with a good agency to take on. 

If it is air travel then Mumbai or Bangalore have almost equivalent if not the same level of connectivity as Delhi. with two new international airports opening near Delhi and Mumbai respectively it's going to be a cut to cut connectivity comparison anyways.  "

Are there any other cities that we should consider outside of Budapest? We’re interested in seeing a town with Christmas markets and some initial research suggested that there were some good ones in Budapest. But this is not a trip dedicated to seeing them. We are set on Rome at this point but open to hearing other suggestions - particularly if Venice is best seen during other seasons. I think we’d prefer to keep this trip pretty touristy as my parents prefer site seeing popular destinations and we’ll keep the more in depth travel experiences for separate trips. Greece, Portugal and Spain are not options as atleast one of us has done one or more of those within the last year. 

How does the length of time look for each city? We are fine with being on the go and spending the days sight seeing. We are also open to adding maybe one more city even if it’s for 2 days. Originally, I had baked in Florence but I’d prefer to spend a longer trip there and really enjoy the art (my family is not into art). 

Any other suggestions or commentary are welcome!!

t3_1fs65w0,Does anyone else feel like travel is dying?,"It just felt much more exciting between the years 2012-2018. It was much more affordable, tourists traps were less prominent and people were friendlier. I would meet people in the country I was visiting and create long lasting bonds and friendships, we would have cultural exchanges and the experience just felt more authentic. Now, no one wants tourists to visit (including people in my own country screaming no more tourists), the price of Airbnbs and hotels have sky rocketed and their are endless tourists traps everywhere.

Does anyone else feel the same?"

I periodically get a message that tells me to connect to the internet to use it. I don't know if the shift to AI-based translation means it's now too cloud-reliant to work sans connection?

t3_1fr6bdo,Experience with AirAsia,"So I am currently on a few month long trip in SEA. While doing my research, I read A LOT of horror stories about AirAsia. Especially regarding cancelling, delaying, and weighing bags. 

Let me preface this post with the context that I have now only flown twice with AirAsia, so obviously, it is very likely I just got lucky. But my flights were completely fine.

I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar, and Denpasar to Labuan Bajo. I have a 42 L backpack (not very small by any means, but also not giant) and a personal item. They never even asked to weigh my bags. The flights were on time, the boarding process was fine. The seats are a little uncomfortable, but the flights weren’t very far. 

I feel like I should update this post at the end of my trip after flying more with AirAsia, lol… 

BUT I wanted to make this post for the worry warts like myself who read every bad review and horror story before doing something 😅 odds are you will be fine flying AirAsia!!"
t3_1frizt6,Has anyone done a ski vacation in Switzerland? ,"Having decision paralysis due to so many ski resort options! 

We’re a couple, intermediate skiers, used to skiing in PNW (eg Whistler), we would stick to groomed runs rather than exploring off-piste. 

Would love to experience riding trains to go skiing, and beautiful views of mountains or the village. 

We’re also big foodies, so access to good food is a priority. Not that interested in a big party or clubbing atmosphere, but it’s ok if that’s what comes with villages that have great food. 

Does anyone have advice on which Swiss ski resorts to visit? So far I’ve been researching:

- Crans Montana (included with Epic local pass)
- Andermatt (included with Epic local pass)
- Zermatt (seems like the obvious must-see)
- Verbier (heard good things about it from reddit)
- Jungfrau region (Grindelwald, Wengen, Murren - have been in the summer and loved it)

Budget is around $300/night hotel. Not looking for 5 star luxury but just decent clean and comfortable rooms in a good location. 

Open to any advice or tips on where to go!"

I can't find any info online, it seems Air Japan is quite new still.

There is no way to check in &amp; download my boarding pass on their website. They state on their website, from Narita (my airport, going to Seoul):

Airport
Check-in is conducted automatically no later than 4 hours before departure time and a Boarding Pass will be sent to the email address you registered at the time of booking.
If you do not receive the email, please come to the check-in counter.

Can anyone advise when they received their boarding pass? It's so vague. Was it days before the flight? Hours? Did you have to do something to prompt it? I have already added passport details to manage my booking.

Thank you. "

I am from New York City and I was considering San Francisco (maybe include Yosemite, Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas along the way) or south of Cali (maybe San Diego and LA) but I am not sure how cold it would be and whether all these places would be a good idea. I wanted to get recommendations and wisdom from the community on these places or other places that might be worth it before I book flights. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!

* Outdoor activities - we love walking, open to try kayaking, paddleboarding, padel, something new...
* Some natural beauty
* A little bit of nightlife / music - but not absolutely necessary"

Things I don’t like are places which are difficult to access, driving, and honestly I don’t care for art museums.

Countries that seem to fit the bill for some of these items and I would love to one day travel to are:

France, Spain, Greece, Switzerland, Iceland.

t3_1fqkx5e,Denied Boarding - boarding pass was still valid,"Hi everyone,
My original flight was from LIS to MAD to DFW to IAH. 

Sept 26
I arrived at the airport at 9am for my 12pm flight. My boarding pass got me through security just fine. 

My LIS -&gt; MAD flight got delayed by 2 hrs, which would’ve caused me to miss my flight from Madrid to DFW. I didn’t think too much of it, and assumed I would be rebooked on the next available flight out of MAD.

I show up to the gate to board, and when the gate agent scans my boarding pass, an error shows up. 

Turns out Iberian (or American Airlines) had changed my itinerary completely to a new flight with United…that had already left 2 hrs ago, so I was denied boarding. 

I was confused since I had not been notified through the app, and my booking confirmation was still valid through American. Everything remained the same. I called American and waited on their callback list and never received one. I also called Capital One Travel, and everything looked the same on their end. I finally talked to Iberian, and they said they couldn’t just rebook me for another flight since American was responsible for the flight.

I checked my spam email randomly - didn’t even think too much of it - and found that Iberian Airlines had sent me a pdf file stating I needed to check in for my new flight (the flight i was supposed to be on).

Email was sent at 7am.

Because I needed to go back home, Capital One booked me a one-way flight for $1400 the next day. :(

I’m just confused since I have yet to talk to AA - what happened? How did my pass get me through despite not even being registered for that flight? Why was my original itinerary not updated? To add I still kept receiving updates from AA regarding the last two flights of MAD -&gt; DFW -&gt; IAH…wouldn’t it already have been negated?

Would appreciate some insight.

Update: Am currently trying to file a complaint and realized that Iberia didn’t even issue me a ticket # for the original booking, just the new one."

So now I'm wondering if my current visa would also be valid for 90 days but with the wrong exit date?

Agent of MH wasn’t responding and dropped the chat after realising that it’s a complaint. 

Second agent confirmed that he couldn’t check in himself. 

We flew with Ryanair. The staff saw us struggling and confirmed that the MH used a different email (the reason i couldn’t check in) and still applied charges.

Thing is that im kind of planning my trip to see what my options are, and i could use a little help i think...

  
My plan now is celebrate new years in Copenhagen. I did that as well last year and it was so much fun. Back then i had the same idea to go to the pole circle by train but found Copenhagen so much fun that i didn't go any further north. Anyway, after Copenhagen i want to visit Stockholm, because that is where the night train to Narvik in Norway departs. After that im a bit lost. I would really like to visit Narvik because a friend told me its nice and its in the polecircle.  From there to Haperanda where i can take the bus into Finland to Kemi where a train runs to Helsinki.  

Have you guys got any recommendations for my trip, some nice cities (especially nightlife and i know thats a bit hard to find in Scandinavia haha) or some nice rail routes. I would also like to know a bit more about trains and good train connections, and if they are punctual and reliable during winter.

t3_1frapec,Schiphol Airport Porter Service (Amsterdam) – Won't Lift Bags Off Belt,"Hey everyone,

I recently contacted the Schiphol Airport Porter Service (Amsterdam) to arrange assistance for an elderly family member who needed help with their baggage. To my surprise, they told me that the elderly person has to collect their bags from the luggage belt themselves because porters are not allowed to pick up luggage from the belt.

Honestly, this seems pretty useless. If an elderly person can lift their bags off the belt, how hard could it be for them to push a trolley afterward?! The whole point was to provide assistance where it's most needed, but it seems the service doesn't cover that crucial part.

Has anyone else experienced this or encountered the same issue with them? Any advice on alternative services would be greatly appreciated!

t3_1fqwpft,Help with Honeymoon to Vietnam,"Hi everyone! 

I am reaching out for some help planning our honeymoon to Vietnam. We will be there for 15 full days and while we want to see as much of the country as we possibly can and are okay with travelling via car or plane between in-country destinations, we are trying to avoid feeling like we are completely rushing from one place to the next. For some context, we are 32 and 36. We are not much of ""hang on the beach for hours"" type people and are looking for a honeymoon that has a mix of culture/history, city life, maybe a couple of days on the beach, and then of course some more romantic time immersed in nature. While we definitely want to see some tourist destinations, we tend to enjoy the more ""off the beaten path"" places. Here is what we have so far and would definitely appreciate feedback as far as places we may want to spend more/less time in - places we maybe SHOULD have on here that we don't - really anything we may want to be aware of. Our flight flying in and out of Hanoi have already been purchased.

  
Thank you in advance!!

11/19 - Travel day

11/20 - Travel day - arriving in Hanoi at night.

11/21 - 11/25 - Hanoi (4 nights - day trip to Ninh Binh somewhere in here?)

11/25 - 11/26 Pu Luong (1 night)

11/26 - 11/29 - Hoi An (3 nights)

11/29 - 12/1 - Quy Nhon (2 nights)

t3_1fr0xth,"Hiking towns near Santiago, Chile",A buddy and I are looking at flying into Santiago and then taking a rental car into the Andes. I was wondering if there are any towns that are known for being used as base camps where we could go do day hikes for about 3-4 days in a row where we’d be able to stay in a hotel/hostel and not have to drive more than 45 minutes each day. I’ve seen ‘Baños Morales’ as a possible town but was hoping I could get some input from others. We’d be going in December if that matters and are hoping to see snow peak mountains.

t3_1fr3zl1,Traveling to Tijuana from San Diego,"Hi Reddit,

I'm planning a road trip from Seattle to San Diego along US101, and I'm considering taking a detour to visit Tijuana, Mexico. However, I've come across several stories about people being stopped and allegedly extorted by police while driving cars with US license plates (which would be my case as well). I'm originally from Eastern Europe, not a US citizen. I'm a bit concerned about the potential for issues with local law enforcement.

Is it still a good idea to visit Tijuana, or should I avoid it? I'd really appreciate it if anyone could share their recent experiences driving in Mexico with US plates.

Update: I am also have a Global Entry card, interesting how does it work there. Is there kiosk or something when I can go back without lines?

Thanks in advance :)



Update: I did it. I parked car near San Ysidro Public Library, then took a train to the border (2.5$), then crossed the border in 5m (before that I filled the immigration form online). Then walked about 30m to downtown. On the way back in 5h, the US border officer spend about 5m checking all my stamps in my passport"

A friend of ours recommended the Hotel Catalonia Plaza Mayor. Is this a good place? It was about $212.00/night or  $850 usd total for a city view room. While it's in the budget to go that high, it's a bit of a stretch for us and we were hoping for something a bit lower cost, but still good and not sketchy.

Question #1- What method of method should I use when in DR? I’m not going to use my debit card because the currency exchange would be a lot. I heard someone mention a travel visa, but I’m trying to avoid Visa cards and I obviously don’t want to carry loads of cash on me. 

Question #2- what’s the process like when you departing an airport? (Customs, security etc) is there a specific order you need to go in? 

Question #3- do you recommend layovers or a direct flight? 

Question #4- If I did a layover, would I have to grab checked baggage or would the airport move the checked baggage from first airplane to my next? 

Tips from someone who visited DR before would be greatly appreciated as well! Thanks in advance. "

t3_1fpzvg3,Travel companions and learned helplessness?,"Have you ever traveled with someone who’s well-informed and confident in their everyday life, but becomes weirdly complacent as soon as they go somewhere else? For example, not looking up basic stuff like time zone, cash vs card use, electrical outlets, and currency(??) before they leave the country? And they expect to just be kind of carried along like a kid whose parents are taking them to Disneyworld, or else they are shocked (shocked!) when things don’t operate exactly like they do at home?

I have a feeling that because everyone has smartphones, we feel like we don’t have to prepare a lot in advance because we  can always look it up if we need to. The problem is when some people feel so secure in this that they just…don’t. 

Anyway, it’s ultimately a very low-stakes complaint, and it’s also on me for not asking more detailed questions in advance about how my companions like to prepare for a trip. If people start treating me like their unpaid trip coordinator/mom in the future, I think I’ll just shrug and pretend and pretend I’m out of data."

t3_1fqs0g7,[Netherlands] Anyone does short weekend/day trips around europe?,"I live in the Netherlands(Eindhoven) and I am considering doing short weekend/day trips around europe.

I know of two options. One is flixbus. Second one is NS international.

Yet another option is to take the train from Eindhoven to Amsterdam and then I would get more options.

I want to do short/quick trips every other weekend. And want to avoid the long waiting times at the airports.

When I am there I might stay the night at a hotel or return the same day.

The only one I have done so far is Eindhoven to Antwerpen via Ns international. Although there arent many Eindhoven to X city possibilites. I guess I need to first travel to Amsteerdam always?

Flixbus is good too and it guarantees a seat. Although maybe slower than NS international.

Need advice from anyone who has done this before.

What mode of transportation do you use? Do you use anything to save money?"

t3_1frgwm5,travel in Europe ,"You know, for years, people have been romanticizing the whole “Eurotrip” thing. Yeah, the dream of hopping from one postcard-perfect city to the next, with a backpack and a camera, living that carefree, bohemian lifestyle. Sounds great, right? Well, let me tell you something – *fuck that*. Seriously, *fuck* traveling across Europe.

Don’t get me wrong – I’ve done the whole damn thing. I’ve been to more countries than I can count, from the beaches of Spain to the fjords of Norway, from the overpriced croissants in Paris to the *way-too-sober* mornings in Berlin. Hell, I’ve even hitchhiked through Eastern Europe with nothing but a packet of dried noodles and a head full of optimism. But after you’ve spent months traversing jungles in Southeast Asia, dodging drug dealers in Colombia, or climbing mountains in the Andes with oxygen levels low enough to make you rethink your entire life, Europe starts to feel like a monotonous joke.

Let me give you an example. You’re in Poland, you book a train to Italy. Sounds nice, right? Wrong. That ""quick train ride"" is a goddamn *nightmare*. Polish trains are never on time. You’re standing there, waiting, cursing the damn thing, freezing your balls off in winter or melting in the summer heat. When the train finally arrives, you’re packed in like sardines, everyone avoiding eye contact like it’s a national sport. Then you get to Germany, where the trains are a bit better, but the prices? They’ll have you selling a kidney just to make it to the next city. And God forbid you accidentally sit in a reserved seat! The death stares you get – you’d think you just insulted someone’s grandmother.

And don’t even get me started on the airports. Europe’s airports are an exercise in frustration, particularly if you’ve ever experienced the beautiful chaos of places like Bangkok or Mexico City. In Asia, shit just *works*. Somehow, in the madness, it all flows. Sure, you’ve got tuk-tuks, street vendors, and honking taxis everywhere, but it’s a *vibe*. It’s alive. You feel like you’re part of something. In Europe? You’re standing in a mile-long line in London Heathrow, some passive-aggressive staff member shouting at you to remove your shoes, belt, laptop, dignity… whatever else you might be holding on to after security. Then there’s the *constant* delays – oh, the weather, the staff are on strike, or the pilot’s just having a bad day. And when you finally board, you’re greeted with a rock-hard sandwich for 15 euros. *Cheers*.

It’s not just the logistics that make me want to scream. It’s the vibe, man. I’ve done long stretches in Southeast Asia, Central America, Africa – and what’s different is, people are open. They talk. They want to hear your story, even if it’s just broken English. You can be sitting on the back of a rusty pickup truck in Vietnam with a bunch of locals who can’t speak a word of Polish or English, but somehow, you’re all laughing at the same shitty joke made through gestures and grunts. That’s *connection*.

In Europe? Try talking to anyone on a tram in Prague. Just try. You’ll get a raised eyebrow, maybe a grunt, if you’re lucky. Everyone’s glued to their phones, earphones in, like they’ve got this invisible bubble around them that says, “Stay the hell away from me.” And I’m not even talking about just the locals – the travelers too. There’s this weird competition in Europe – “Oh, you haven’t seen the *real* Croatia until you’ve stayed in some backwater Airbnb for 200 euros a night and posted about it on Instagram.” It’s exhausting. Like, buddy, I’ve slept in bamboo huts, bathed in a river with locals in Laos, and watched the sun rise over the Himalayas. I don’t need your overpriced tapas and fancy hostel recommendations.

And the fucking tourists. Jesus Christ, the tourists. You try going to Florence or Barcelona in the summer and you’ll swear off traveling for life. Hordes of them, following around some poor guide waving a flag in the air, taking the same pictures as everyone else, clogging up every single picturesque alley with their selfie sticks and matching hats. It’s like a dystopian zombie movie, but instead of brains, they’re after *“authentic experiences”* that they’re going to forget the moment they fly back home.

Look, I get it. Europe has history, beauty, and all that jazz. But you know what? After living out of a backpack for years, roaming around places where people *actually* live in the moment, Europe just feels… sterile. Controlled. It’s like you’re going through the motions of travel, but without the soul. There’s no edge. No real danger. I miss the thrill of getting lost in a country where you can’t speak the language, relying on the kindness of strangers, eating food you’ve never heard of, and just *being* in the chaos of it all.

So, yeah, Europe is pretty and all, but after you’ve had your fair share of real, gritty, life-changing travel experiences, it’s hard not to see it for what it is – a neatly packaged, overpriced, overhyped playground for tourists who think they’re adventurers. Give me the wild jungles, the sketchy bus rides, the street food that might give you food poisoning but tastes like heaven any day over another €8 croissant and a “hidden” piazza full of influencers."

t3_1fqp7lb,Bolivia: will Uyuni tour with transfer suffice for proof of onward travel?,"Im traveling to Bolivia tomorrow from Peru over land, crossing near Puno. U.S.passport. I’ve read horror stories of people being turned away or rung out at the border crossing and I’m trying to make sure I have everything in order. I tried to get my visa at the consulate in Cusco, but they “ran out of stickers” (🙄) and told me that I’d need to apply at the border, so here I am. I have everything that’s listed on the U.S. embassy site, plus a few things that aren’t just in case. For the visa fee, I have preciously flat USD bills fresh from an ATM and pressed inside a large book for safe-keeping.

My one remaining question is whether they’ll give me a hard time about onward travel. I have a Uyuni tour booked that includes a transfer option to San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, which I plan to take. It’s a private transfer arranged through the agency, so I don’t have a formal bus ticket to show and can’t get one. I printed out the tour itinerary from the agency website and can point to where it mentions the transfer. Will that suffice? I thought about booking a dummy ticket out of the country as a backup, but since they ask for a detailed itinerary of my entire trip and I do plan on going to Chile that day, the dummy ticket would contradict that.

Relatedly, does anyone know why Bolivia makes it so incredibly difficult for people to visit their beautiful country and spend a bunch of money? Is this a tourism control measure?"

My health is good, and I've got plenty savings. I do live with my parents, but they say I can stay as long as I want. 

I can't think of a reason not to go, but is five or six weeks going to be enough time to get ready? What are the main things I should be prepared for in Costa Rica or Brazil? Would it be better to just wait a year?

t3_1fqbzuw,"Avis/Budget Rental - Fraudulent Charges Post Rental &amp; ""Nora Henry""","I recently rented a car from Budget near LGA airport and paid the rate for a hybrid. They gave me a mid-size SUV and refused to swap me into another car because ""you pre-paid and there's nothing we can do here since you paid Budget.com"".  Annoying enough but I figured I can contest with HQ. 

Issue is after the return. They tried to hit me with not one but two (so far) charges saying I damaged the car. First one was a ""spoiled"" interior claim. Second was a ""dent repair required"" claim, a full 1.5 weeks after the car was already returned. Both I had to get Budget HQ involved to waive because I had picture proof of no such damage - and the local franchisee apparently did not document the supposed spoilage/damage at all. 

I noticed that both letters came from ""Nora Henry"", working different positions every time (first was just some specialist title and the second time, she was magically with roadside assistance).

A google search tells me I'm not the only one who this has happened to.

So I was just wondering if more people had this happen to them? Should I expect more of these baseless accusations? How is there not a class action lawsuit against Budget/Avis for this bullshit they are pulling? It's taking us time and not to mention the mental energy to fight these fake charges they are trying to pull on consumers. 

To anyone thinking of renting a car to travel - **steer clear of Budget/Avis**!"

As the title suggests, I'm planning to do a road trip, preferably in south of France, where I explore a larger area of France and travel between medieval feeling villages. I'm looking for places which have a similar vibe to Saint-Antoin-Noble-Val. It is a bit hard to choose my destination and what villages, areas are worth seeing. I was thinking of flying to Toulouse and then starting a road trip from there, but I'm also open to any other suggestions it that's not the best starting point.
Where do you think I should start? What's the best area in France where I will find a lot of villages, towns with this vibe? What specific villages would you recommend me to go to?
I'm not looking for big touristy places and fancy stuff, they can be random villages with old buildings and the medieval feeling. 
Regarding the length of the trip, I'm planning to rent a car and spend between 4-10 days in the area, depending on how large the list of stuff I want to visit ends up being."
t3_1fqhyd2,Traveling from Canada to the Philippines with 3 months of medication.

We've been trying to research this and nothing is coming up with a straight answer. I know it's possible to enter the Philippines with the medication as long as the proper paperwork is presented. The question is whether it's possible to travel through Singapore, or Korea, or the other common layover destinations. Internet research is turning up inconclusive answers, and the phone number to the Singapore embassy seems to be non-functional, giving a busy signal. There's a direct flight, but it's almost $400 more than the flights with layovers. I'd love to know a trusted source for this. She's stressing about it a lot and at this point I think she's prepared to spend over $1,000 to just make this problem go away and take a direct flight. If you think that's the best idea, please feel free to chime in.

t3_1fqhxm5,1 week mid-December trip: London or Mexico City?,"Hi everyone! I am deciding on taking a trip with my partner this December. We are having trouble deciding between CDMX and London. We are in NYC and in our late 20s. We like the usual with exploring local neighborhoods, great restaurants, museums, coffee, history, bakeries, parks, etc. We are not into nightlife or drinking. Of course, both CDMX and London have all of these in spades, which makes it that much harder to decide. I’ve been to London but when I was a teenager and neither have been to CDMX. We don’t speak Spanish. 

The biggest deciding factors for us are probably the options for day trips/short trips away, weather, crowdedness, and cost. 

- Is the weather that bad in London in December? I know the sun sets around 3-4pm which sounds bad but does it actually feel dead and miserable? I am a bit intrigued just because I feel like regardless London will have a cozy vibe. But the weather and greenery in CDMX seems spectacular. 

- I know food scene seems like it should go easily to CDMX but London’s food scene seems so interesting and diverse. Especially because we are very into pastries and desserts

- How crowded is each city in this time of year (around Dec 13-20)? We would prefer a less touristy time relatively. 

- London seems like there are more neighborhoods to explore for tourists while I sense that the tourist friendly area in CDMX is mostly in Roma Polanco Condesa etc. Does that start to feel like too little for a week?

- Is London that expensive for the USD worth? We are from NYC so we are okay w high prices but would not want to go somewhere that is significantly even more expensive. 

- Lastly, day/side trip options are a factor. We are interested in some English villages or towns (Bath seems lovely) but also all of the nature and Aztec history around CDMX seems so cool. 

Which would you recommend? Thanks!!"
t3_1fqe9oe,December upstate NY travel ,"I’m looking for some assistance with upcoming travel. I’m looking to do two nights/three days in a new part of NY I haven’t been to (live in Jersey and will drive 4-5 hours). I found two spots that look pretty and are at the top of my budget (under $500/night with hotel taxes and fees). As a note, I had looked at Mohonk mountain house but just cannot justify the cost of staying there, though I see rave reviews (it’s also close enough for us to do a day pass, but just giving perspective on where I’ve looked).

Right now I’m considering the lake house at canandaigua in the finger lakes region. I like the idea of having wineries nearby and there’s a few close by restaurants. Inns of aurora also looks nice but it’s slightly more and being that I’m already at budget I’m not sure it’s worth it.

On the other hand, I looked at mirror lake inn over in the lake placid region. They have a spa there (which I like but isn’t a priority) and also great reviews, including food etc. 

I’m not a winter gal so I’d really just like a nice cozy atmosphere, good food and drinks, and some warm fireplaces. (One luxury resort in PA offers snow shoeing and that’s probably the most wintry activity I’d want to try out.)

Any recommendations are appreciated! "
t3_1fqzuc9,We are back from 10 days in the Czech Republic and Austria.  Here is a short list of tips and/or annoyances.,"Both countries use coin op bathrooms (WCs) in the public bathrooms, including the train stations.  So be prepared with some 50 cent (Euro) coins.  It will give you change if you put in one Euro.  I think it will give you change if you put in a 2 Euro coin, but don't count on it.  Czech Republic uses Czech Koronas (sp?).  I don't remember exactly what they charge.  Perhaps 20 CK?

Be prepared if you don't get a luggage locker at the train station.  Sometimes they run out of lockers.  One time there were none available for us.  Other times it was not a problem.

If you have a PIN for your credit card, take it with you.  Multiple times we had trouble getting cash from the ATM.  Maybe it was a machine problem or a card reading problem.  In any case take multiple cards (debit and credit) with you if you are counting on those for cash.  I did not have trouble with the Tap and pay with my credit card when buying things.  But to get cash out, it was not as easy,

Smokers, smokers, smokers.  Every building entrance had smokers hanging out.  And not pot smokers.  All tobacco smokers.

One time we took the wrong bus.  And that was after we asked the driver where he was going.  Bring up your train/bus ticket up on your phone and show it to the driver so he can see exactly what the destination is and any transfer connections.

I don't have strong feelings about which city or coast.

- When i booked through expedia I made sure we had 3 seats on both flights for my sons comfort. What I don't understand is why they took this away and made me pay for an infant seat on top of the child seat I paid for, effectively charging me double.

t3_1fr0wff,What's the logic for vegetarian special meals on flights??,"After yet another flight with a subpar special meal, I need to understand once and for all the logic behind how the airline (or is it the crew?) decides what meals to serve, specifically for lacto-ovo vegetarians.

I don't eat meat or fish, but I very much love eggs and cheese. Yet, time and time again, despite requesting a lacto-ovo meal, I get what closely resembles vegan food. It's usually some grains with veggies, vegan-friendly desert and sometimes even vegan butter. I have tried getting the Indian meal and that's been hit or miss with the quality too.

What's interesting, though, is that most airlines now offer a choice of at least 2 dishes during their regular service - one of which is usually vegetarian - with much better-looking starters, mains and desserts. I'd say I regret ordering the special meal 8 times out of 10 these days and only do it on the off chance that this specific flight won't have a veggie option.

My question is - why do they even bother giving someone who has requested an LOV meal something different to what's served in the standard service in this situation? I'd totally prefer just eating some pasta and real cheese instead of a dry bed of rice and some steamed veggies. It just seems not worthwhile for the airline to go through the trouble of giving someone a special meal that's more restrictive diet-wise when there's a meal that perfectly fits their criteria already available.

I'm sure everything has a reason, but it just seems so odd to me!

EDIT: to clarify - I don’t feel entitled to the exact meal I ordered or any special treatment. As someone with a dietary restriction who travels to many meat-heavy countries, I’m very used to finding something I can eat and enjoying it. I just wanted to see if there was a rhyme or reason to why special meals are the way they are so that I could adapt better.

t3_1fqc5qe,Japan first timer / first time overseas / looking for advice,"Hey guys! My partner and I are planning to travel to Japan next year 2025 for the first time. Actually it's our first time overseas ever. I feel fairly prepared. I've been talking to a lot of people and I've gotten a lot of information from them. I also listen to a really good podcast called sightseeing Japan on Spotify if anyone is interested. 

I just need advice mostly about the cherry blossom season. We really want to see this of course as does everyone it seems haha. But I'm really concerned about the crowds and whether it's going to ruin our trip. Obviously I'm prepared to deal with crowds, but does anyone have any experience during Cherry Blossom season versus outside of the season? The other time of year I was thinking of going was during November which is Autumn. It looks beautiful, and nice weather. However, I'm being a bit greedy here and I don't really want to wait until this time next year haha. So I might just have to deal with the crowds. As you can imagine being our first time overseas, I'm very, very excited but also very overwhelmed and a little scared.

Our basic plan is to fly into Tokyo and go to Disneyland as well as many other attractions and districts here. Then we'll go to mount Fuji and may stay closer to the mountain or travel by day from Tokyo. However, I think with the crowds the travel by day may take too long and may chip into too much of our time around the mountain. So I'm not really sure what to do here. I've heard the buses can line up for hours and hours but during Cherry Blossom season, it may be worse or course? Or is it busy regardless? I was also interested in climbing mount Fuji or hiking from station 5. However, obviously we would need to go during climbing season, but that's summer and it seems too hot. My birthday is in July and waiting till July isn't too bad so perhaps we could. However, how's the weather around this time? Does it make it unenjoyable? 

The next plan is to travel on the on the shinkansen to Osaka and go to Nara and Hiroshima for day trips. From here we would also visit Kyoto. I think I'd still like to book some accommodation in Kyoto so we can enjoy the peaceful side of it. And not worry about lining up on buses for hours to get there. I've heard in the podcast I listen to that if you're doing day trips to Kyoto from Osaka the buses into the town can take about 4 hours out of your day, which really chips into your time to explore Kyoto and really get the most out of seeing the temples. So I'm considering staying in Kyoto for 2 to 3 days to really enjoy the experience and not worry too much about public transport. Thoughts?

I don't really know where else to go from here. We want to spend 3 to 4 weeks in Japan. Rough idea was one week in Tokyo one week in Osaka a couple of days around mount Fuji and a couple of days around Kyoto. Obviously with day trips to Nara and Hiroshima thrown in. What else would you do/where else would you recommend going?

We would love to see the snow in Japan and try snowboarding at some point. However, this may be a separate trip during winter time, as this time around, I think we're going to want to see majority of the culture of Japan in all different cities and the snowy weather may hinder this. We are from Australia so are used to hot weather.

We are big nerds and gamers so obviously looking forward to experiencing that culture in Tokyo and Akihabara, and Universal. But we're also into fitness, so hiking and exploring the outskirts of Japan would also be exciting and have a nice contrast to the cities where we can enjoy the peaceful culture. So we're really open to anything. Of course in Osaka will go to Universal studios and all the main attractions. But during cherry blossom season who has experience here and do you think we should wait a bit longer, and go outside of the season? Is it really so busy that you can't enjoy it? Or can you just plan around it and stay closer to the attractions/book ahead so there's less crowds/bus travel, etc?? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you 😁"

We are willing to spend up to four (rather three) nights depending on how much there is to see. 

Most of the following places have similar priced flights from our city so the price difference of accommodation, food, activities etc. is more relevant to us. Being affordable is definitely an important factor. 

We are a young couple so would love a place where we can spend an exciting day out and about and also get a drink in a lively bar at night. We are reasonably interested in culture but will not spend all day visiting museums. Also big foodies! 

These are our contenders(however also open to any other suggestions):

- Edinburgh
- Copenhagen 
- Lisbon
- Budapest

I want to note that we are not necessarily looking to escape the winter and do not mind some bad weather, but do want to be able to enjoy our destination. (This comes from family members insisting that Edinburgh will not be enjoyable AT ALL during that time. Would love other opinions on that)"
t3_1fq8309,Eastern Turkey advice,"I'm planning to travel solo to Turkey for about three weeks in April or May. I'll arrive in Istanbul and intend to spend a good amount of time there since I've never visited before. The main reason for my trip is to explore the eastern regions and to experience Kurdish culture.

I'm a bit uncertain about travel logistics. Since I need to fly back from Istanbul, I'll be travelling eastward and then returning west. Normally, I prefer travelling by bus, but I'm open to renting a car -perhaps starting from Gaziantep- and then taking a flight back to Istanbul.

Do you think it's feasable to visit Istanbul, possibly Cappadocia (not a must, but I'd like to if possible), and then head east to places like Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Mardin, and maybe Van (tough that may be too far), considering I have to go back to Istanbul? I don't want to spend most of my trip driving or on buses, I prefer to take my time in each location and explore each region thoroughly. I may be too ambitious.

Anybody had a similar trip?"

i want to visit for the churches mainly and would also be keen to visit the el chopo heavy metal market if it’s not too far out from more touristy areas.
would it be safe? only thing is that i’m not very well travelled, only ever been on holidays in berlin and amsterdam and around the UK (where i’m from). my friend hasn’t travelled much either, she lived in somalia for a few years when she was a kid to stay with family but that’s all as far as im aware.

t3_1fq63yp,Check In TrenItalia through Omio,"
Hello, I bought tickets through Omio (Milan to Varrena) and only received an email from Omio with a link to the tickets on the Omio app with a QR code, and pdfs with the tickets and it’s written to not be valid and without a QR code, am I supposed to get an email from trenitalia for the CheckIn?

On the Omio app I can go trenitalia and there on the bottom is written “Activation is automatic and occurs at the time of the scheduled departure of the train. To change it, click on 'Manage' before the ticket activation” so is the check in automatic?

Maybe I like being by myself more and theres more freedom in doing so."

1. **Japan Airlines** (2018, 2020, cream of the crop)
2. **EVA**, Taiwan (2020, also cream of the crop)
3. **Cathay Pacific**, Hong Kong (2018, I understand morale has taken a hit since COVID but my memories remain very fond)
4. **KLM**, Netherlands (2014, 2015, 2022, best European carrier)
5. **Air France** (2022, flight from France to US was amazing) 
6. **Qantas**, Australia (2018, great, but I understand they've taken a nosedive since COVID)
7. **Fiji Airways** (2017, 2018, *under*rated and very solid)
8. **Singapore Airlines** (2018, 2020, slightly *over*rated but still solid)
9. **Austrian Airlines** (2014, 2022, solid)
10. **Allegiant Air**, USA (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022, *never* had a bad experience and when they've canceled flights, they've been *more* than gracious and generous with refunds and credits)
11. **Jetstar Asia,** Singapore (2018, 2020, never a bad experience)
12. **Virgin Australia** (2017, 2018, staff at MEL weren't good but in-flight was great)
13. **Air New Zealand** (2018, staff at CHC weren't good but in-flight was great, want to give them another chance)
14. **Lufthansa**, Germany (2014, maybe things changed since COVID but I still remember this flight well)
15. **Emirates**, UAE (2017, 2018, 5th-freedom flights between Australia and New Zealand, decent but seemed quite overrated)
16. **LATAM**, Chile (2018, a 5th-freedom flight from between Australia and New Zealand, decent)
17. **United Airlines**, USA (2010-2023, rarely have had either a great *or* a lousy experience, but IAH is a terrible hub)
18. **Alaska Airlines**, USA (2013-2022, used to be great but have fallen from grace somewhat since COVID)
19. **WestJet**, Canada (2021, 2022, *could* easily be a top 10 product with some website and service tweaks)
20. **Spirit**, USA (2016, 2019, 2022, either wonderful or abysmal)
21. **Jetstar**, Australia/New Zealand (2017, 2018, either wonderful or abysmal)
22. **AeroMexico** (2016, 2018, very meh)
23. **Delta**, USA (2009-2024, used to be great but have fallen from grace since COVID, B18 lounge at ATL still great)
24. **TAROM**, Romania (2022, nice staff but filthy, aging planes)
25. **JetBlue**, USA (2015, 2016, 2023, used to be great but have fallen from grace since COVID)
26. **Air Canada** (2021, 2023, okay hard product but, very sadly, employees seem demoralized)
27. **HK Express**, Hong Kong (2020, quite late, quite unpleasant gate staff in HK)
28. **Hawaiian Airlines**, USA (2017, 2018, 2023, absolutely awful service, also treated my ex-partner like absolute crap, at least meals are semi-decent)
29. **Frontier Airlines**, USA (2014, 2015, 2017, 2021, liked them at first but counter staff at LAS and DEN are the worst)
30. **American Airlines**, USA (2012-2023, they deserve the dislike that so many have for them, at least DFW is a nice airport)
31. **Southwest Airlines**, USA (2014-2023, they sank to dead last with literal ***blood*** in my seat when I was last to board and couldn't switch seats, shattering contents within my checked luggage, and *them* losing my luggage and - no joke - blaming *me* for that.)

***Dishonorable mention:*** **Turkish Airlines** (2022, 2023). Booked flights to IST. Backed out due to scheduling conflicts (work, then a credible terror threat in Turkey/the ME). Calls to TA to ask for rescheduling or credits met with total hostility. Thankfully AMEX travel insurance had my back after some aggressive cajoling of TA.

**UPDATE #1:** The hate in the comments for KLM, Air France, and even Spirit is a lot more than I expected. But my list remains unchanged.

**UPDATE #2:** I've long said that Southwest and Turkish have damn near cult-like followers. Some of the more snarky, vociferous comments don't exactly give me a reason to change my mind.

I live in the US, hence the numerous US listings.

t3_1fq589i,"Winter Holiday Trip Suggestions for Siblings (F/28, F/26, M/18) – No Beach Cities, Open to Snow!","I (F/28) recently realized that due to corporate holidays, I’ll have two weeks off at the end of the year—first time in a while I’ve had this much time! My younger siblings (F/26, M/18) are also free, so we’re planning a sibling vacation. We live in Southern California and are looking to travel, but we’d prefer to avoid beach cities because we live close by and road trip to Monterey almost every year. We’re open to destinations with a manageable amount of snow (nothing extreme, though).

Budget isn’t a huge issue since I have a lot of airline and credit card points to use, so I can cover a decent amount of expenses. My main concern is finding a place with activities that are still available during the holidays, as we want to make sure things won’t be closed down for Christmas/New Year’s.

t3_1fq4z1j,Pensioner adventurer,"I’m fifty eight living in Japan and retired.

I used to love backpacking and inter-railing and would like to go again. In fact I have a few trips planned - Saigon to Hanoi by train, Calcutta to Darjeeling by train, Lhasa by train, Greek Islands (and in particular Spetses, the setting for John Fowles The Magus), also through the Balkans in the footsteps of Rebecca West’s Black Lamb Grey Falcon.

I don’t fancy sleeping out at stations or staying in hostels given my age (or at least not so often) - 2 star or 3 star hotels are fine. I’m keen to save money because firstly I can save money that way and secondly because I don’t want to stay in a tourist bubble - I’d prefer to spend more time in a country if I could afford it instead of staying in an expensive resort.

The problem is I can’t seem to find anyone else interested in this approach.

Is it only me? What do other oldies of Reddit think about this type of trip? I’m beginning to think I’m just odd.

Which brings me to my questions:

**What airport makes the most sense to fly in and out of?**  I'm going to try to use the same airport for both, knowing full well that's a lot of driving, but I like to use Turo for my car rentals as it's much more affordable.

**Is there anything between the two destinations that I should considering stopping and making a day out of?**  

**Have I alloted enough time?**  Assuming we get in early on the 17th and maybe even leaving late on the 24th for an overnight flight back to NY, that leaves me 7 days, assuming one travel day in the middle of the week and then driving on the way back on the 24th.

t3_1fq3f3o,Connecting through Singapore Changi. Diff airlines / bookings / terminals. Do we need to clear customs / immigration?,"Hello friends, 

I looked through the layover FAQ but it doesn't have much regarding self transfers so I hope I can ask here.

We need some help. So we just booked flights into and out of Singapore / Changi for the start of our big Asia trip but had to use separate airlines and book separately due to cost. Coming into SIN on Japan Airlines, into Terminal 1 and leaving on Singapore Airlines out of Terminal 2. We have US Passports.

The big worry is we have maybe 2.5 hours. First, does anyone know for sure whether we can go from T1 to T2 without having to clear customs? Second, if we don't have to clear customs, will we still need to re-clear security? Does anyone know how long you think this will take at roughly 8:00 AM on a normal day?

We don't know if we will be checking luggage. We probably will. If anyone has knowledge / experience, can you let us know what to expect in either case? Checked vs carryon only?

My wife is in a bit of a panic about this as we didn't take this into account when choosing flights. Changing flights to leave us more time in between will cost more than we have in the budget.

t3_1fqk98u,"Guest Canceled After Claiming Fraud, Now Demanding Refund","So, two days ago a guy booked a one-night stay at my place through Booking.com. We talked on the phone, and I explained that he still needed to pay cash when he arrives since Booking.com only held the amount on his card for confirmation. I told him he’d get a refund as soon as he paid me directly.

I'm new to the platform, but I travel a lot and this has happened to me many times with other hotels—where they hold your card and you pay cash when you arrive. It's nothing unusual, and the website even says I have to collect the payment from the guest.

But then he started getting really rude, calling us a scam and saying he’d report me to the police. I tried to explain politely (he’s a foreigner, by the way), but he wouldn’t listen and kept insisting we were trying to steal from him. After a long back-and-forth, I even offered to let him stay for free just to avoid any issues, since I didn’t want to deal with the police.

In the end, he insisted on canceling, even though it was past the cancellation period, but I went ahead and accepted it with no fees. Now, he’s asking for his money back and has already reported me to the police, but I didn’t get any money in the first place! Do I really have to refund him from my own pocket even though I didn’t earn anything from his reservation? I’m lost, what should I do?"

t3_1fq2dcv,Switzerland April Trip Advice ,"Hi, I am going to go to Milan Design week up until the 10th of April 2025, which is the day I want to leave to go to Switzerland. Some info: I want to buy a Swiss train travel pass and I want to stay in Switzerland till the 13th April (including) max. So around four days in total. I will not have a car during this time and I have no hiking experience whatsoever, which is why i think I should steer clear of doing that. I also need to go to Stuttgart to catch my flight back home. My final day and night in Switzerland (for this trip) i was thinking could be spent in Zurich. I can go two routes.
1. From Milan to Zermatt (I want to visit Matterhorn)  from their I want to go to Interlaken, where I was planning on booking a two night stay. Those two days I wanted to go to Oeschinen lake (however I heard that the cable car is shut during April?), the Jungfraujoch and Grindelwald. Whilst at Grindelwald I was thinking that I could go on a toboggan but I am not sure those are opened either? If not would there be a winter toboggan opened in the area?  Then I was thinking of going on the Lucerne Interlaken Express- hoping to site see a bit of Lauterbrunnen as well as Lucerne. I am not sure if this would be possible in just one day? So I was also thinking of staying in Lucerne for the night too before heading to Zurich 

2. Go from Milan to St Moritz to catch the Glacier express into Zermatt and then hopefully head into Interlaken all in the same day (does anyone know of a direct bus/train from Milan to St Moritz ? ) and then follow the exact same things as I mentioned above. 

A third option would be to go from Milan to St Moritz and then go on the Bernina Express to Chur. I heard that there was a winter toboggan there too. I could stay a night then make my way into Lauterbrunnen and Lucerne for two nights.
 
I think I would prefer to go with the second option but I am skeptical that I would have enough time in the day to go from Milan to St Moritz and then Zermatt and end my day in Interlaken 
Could anyone give me any tips/advice on any of the above mentioned options? 

Also if anyone has gone paragliding in the Swiss alps, how was it (place/time/cost)?

t3_1fpq71m,Solo trip to China or Japan (outside the main tourist areas)?,"
Hi all, 

I am planning a 2-3 week trip to either China or Japan. I went to both before in the past, this time I only have time for one. I’ve already been to Beijing, Shanghai, Huangshan, Hangzhou, Chengdu before in China and Tokyo, Osaka, Fuji, and Kyoto in Japan. I truly loved both and itching to go back and see more now that I’ve also experienced many other countries since then.

Roughly looking at:
Japan- Fukuoka (plus other parts of Kyushu), Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, then go up to Tokyo and see places like Nikko and Kamakura this time.

OR

China- I don’t know since it’s so big! Yunnan would be cool. Chongqing, Xian, Luoyang, Pingyao as well would be interesting. 

Do any of you have any recommendations for either? Any insights? I have lots of interest in both ancient Chinese history and modern Japanese history due to my studies in college but alas I can only pick one this time. "

We’re going to be staying mostly around Pula but I am DYING to see Dubrovnik and have booked my return flight out of that airport. I’m trying to figure out the best way to get there. 


Flying: Always an option but the times are somewhat limited, which isn’t ideal


Driving: Not a great option as I get very tired when driving long distances 


Bus: It seems like any bus from Istria would take multiple changes, which I prefer to avoid. It also looks like there may (?) be a direct bus during the day, which means losing a whole day of doing stuff. Are there any direct overnight buses I may be missing?


Train: From what I can tell it’s not really an option but please correct me if I’m wrong! It looks like the train mostly runs down the center of the country and doesn’t actually have a stop in Dubrovnik but it’s totally possible I’m missing something 



I’m guessing flying will end up being my best option but I’m hoping someone who’s actually been there may have some little gem to share that I have completely overlooked"

Planning a family trip with the wife, and 2 kids (7 year old and 9 month old).  Looking to do the summer...fairly open June-August, was originally looking at July and August, but I did read about how July is super packed with tourists, and August is European Holiday so no that much better.  So now I am looking at late June.  Also read that everything may be closed during midsummer, so looking to head over as soon as that is done.  Currently thinking:

Arrive Copenhagen \~ June 24th, 2025   
Travel to Stockholm - June 28th, 2025

Travel to Oslo - July 2nd, 2025

Travel to Bergen - July 4th, 2025

Depart for Home on July 7th (can fly direct from Bergen back to USA, via connection in Oslo or Copenhagen so don't need to account for another separate ticket)

  
Questions I have:

1) Would you make any changes to the routing?  

2) I know the weather won't be as warm as July or August, but will it be non-pleasant in June (I know nobody can predict it, just historically)

3) Do we need a car in any place, or can we get around with public transport?

4) To minimize the amount of hotel times, can we stay in Bergen and still do day trips to experience the Fjords?

5) Flåm Railway looks amazing, how would you work that in to the above?  With 2 little kids, I imagine we will have 2 suitcases + stroller, etc.

t3_1fpz3m3,Flixbus not honoring refund policy,"Had a bus get delayed by more than 2 hours, which entitles all passengers to a refund per their [policy](https://help.flixbus.com/s/article/PSSP-How-can-I-request-a-refund-for-a-bus-delayed-more-than-120-minutes?language=en_IE). They didn't honor it, stating that the bus still ultimately got to its destination. The bus was delayed because the driver hit a taxi and had to go all the way back to Nuremberg where it occurred, causing a three hour delay.

Anyone else have experiences with them not honoring their refund policy? Tried disputing the charge on my credit card, but they sided with Flixbus."

t3_1fpyv1s,Better data speeds (Europe eSim providers): Airalo vs. Orange,"Traveling to Iceland, the UK, France and Poland and plan on getting at eSim. I'm leaning towards the Orange Holiday Europe eSim since I'm more familiar with the company and the basic 1 Gb data-only plan is the same price as Airalo's. But, I like the 3 or 5 gb option that Airalo has. Mostly, I just want to make sure I have a fairly reliable data connection that's relatively fast.

Any insights about the data speeds for Airalo or Orange in any of those countries? Using it mostly for Google Maps and messaging and photo sharing via Whatsapp occasionally while on the go.

Or, is there another eSim data-only provider that's an even better option?"

t3_1fpppgk,New Zealand November Itinerary,"We’re traveling as an extended family of 6 -- 5 adults + 1 toddler -- to New Zealand for 2 weeks in late November and early December. So far we’ve only booked our international flights: flying into Auckland on day 1 and departing from Christchurch on day 16. One person is flying in from Sydney and the rest of us from the West Coast of the US. We’re going to rent an 8-seater people mover to get around. Since we have the toddler with us, long hikes or intense adventurous activities are out. We're also trying to avoid too many one-night stops/repacking with less driving in one day, since that'll probably also be rough on a toddler.

Seeking feedback on this itinerary: 

* Day 1: Arrive early, rest, and explore the city. Overnight in Auckland.
* Day 2: More Auckland or a day trip somewhere. Overnight in Auckland.
* Day 3: Do a Hobbiton tour. Overnight in Rotorua (or Matamata if it’s an early Hobbiton tour). 
* Day 4: Explore Rotorua. Overnight in either Rotorua or Taupo.
* Day 5: Long driving day to Wellington. Overnight in Wellington.
* Day 6: Explore Wellington. Overnight in Wellington.
* Day 7: Fly to Queenstown and explore town. Overnight in Queenstown.
* Days 8 - 10: Coach-cruise or fly-cruise tours to Milford Sound, day trips to Glenorchy or Wanaka. Overnights in Queenstown.
* Day 11: Drive towards Mount Cook and Lake Tepako. Overnight in Mount Cook or Lake Tepako.
* Day 12: Explore Mount Cook and Lake Tepako. Overnight in Mount Cook or Lake Tepako.
* Day 13: Drive to Christchurch. Overnight in Christchurch.
* Day 14-15: Explore Christchurch and day trip somewhere. Overnight in Christchurch.
* Day 16: Fly home.

Some outstanding questions we have:

* Any recommendations for an Auckland day trip for day 2?
* Any recommendations for a Christchurch day trip for day 14 or 15?
* For days 11 and 12, is it easier to find accommodation for 6 at Mt. Cook or Lake Tepako?

Finally, the activity we want to do but can’t easily fit into the itinerary is the TranzAlpine train. Some thoughts we had on how to fit this in:

* Do a roundtrip daytrip from Christchurch on the TranzAlpine on Day 14 or 15, which seems redundant. This seems the easiest, and not everyone in our party needs to commit to the train day.
* Go up the West Coast from Queenstown towards Greymouth, drop the car off, then train to Christchurch on day 12 or 13. This would unfortunately mean missing Mt. Cook/Lake Tepako or having to backtrack to visit it."
t3_1fpyc6j,Is it worth getting the Delta Amex and AA Mastercard for the lounges?,"Hi everyone 

I have been traveling a good amount for work - at least 2-3 nights per month and I wanted to check in and get opinions on these credit cards. 

I already have a Marriott Brilliant which has a $650 ish fee ever year, but I get upgraded at 9/10 Marriott properties I stay at. 

I’m wondering if it is a smart idea to get either the Delta Reserve card or the American Airlines Mastercard to gain access to their respective give lounges.  

They both have high fees associated with them but which sucks since I’m already paying for the Marriott Amex. But at the same time it’s nice to be able to go into the lounges at the airports for free food and drinks.  

Does anyone here have both cards? 

Is one better than the other? 

Is there another way to access the lounges without day passes or paying for a membership to the lounges every year?"

t3_1fq6muu,"Question about Border Control in Turkey; left country without stamping Passport out, will this be an issue?

I was living in the UK at the time; we were told that Turkey would be added to the ""Amber List"" so I planned on returning to the UK from Turkey. Turkey ended up staying on the Red List, so in order to avoid having to do a 2 week hotel quarantine I got off the boat on a Greek island and flew back to London from there. 

While I stamped in to Turkish immigration when I arrived, I never officially left or received an exit stamp. As far as I know, they still have me on record as being in the country. I really am not sure how important that is or if it will be an issue. I was planning on flying through Istanbul in the coming weeks but am concerned about this situation.

t3_1fozpwr,What is the first thing you noticed when abroad for the first time?,"
I remember my first two international trips, the first to Mexico on a cruise ship when I was a child, and the second to Paris as an 18-year-old.

During my first trip to Mexico, I was young, ignorant, and had grown up in a very homogenous state. As we approached Mexico, I noticed the TV in our cruise ship cabin started broadcasting in Spanish. The commercials were no longer in English, and I found that fascinating. I remember seeing what I thought was a giant peninsula with a wall as we neared Progreso, and in my naivety, I assumed it was the U.S.-Mexico border. I was very unaware back then.

Paris at 18 was an entirely different experience. Stepping off the plane, I walked through the jet bridge and saw small European cars zipping around below me. It immediately struck me that I was far from home. Inside the airport, I saw French police with their distinct uniforms, which reinforced how foreign everything felt. I was traveling alone and found myself in Terminal 2E—a giant red terminal. Seeing all the alcohol for sale, I asked if I could buy some at 18, and to my surprise, they allowed it. I had a vodka and orange juice at 8 a.m., legally, and I felt like a true adult.

Shortly after landing, I boarded a nonstop flight to Marseille. The plane flew low over rural France, giving me a view of the lush, green countryside. When we arrived in Marseille, I looked out the window and was met with the sight of cerulean waters and orange-roofed buildings—a striking contrast to what I had seen before. The city felt wonderfully eclectic and vibrant. It was an incredible  experience.


I'd love to hear your stories too!"

Purchasing the flight from Heathrow to Singapore seems straight forward but my concerns are around the Singapore to Bali and Bali to Heathrow flights.

When I visit the Emirates website and search for the flights, I receive this message:

“As you selected a departure point outside of United Kingdom (UK), you have now been directed to the Indonesia website to finalise this booking. Your booking will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Indonesia website, including those relating to consumer protections, which may differ from those of United Kingdom (UK). Please note that your booking will be charged in Indonesian Rupiah (IDR).”

So is there no way to pay in GBP if I’m flying from outside the UK? And would I not receive the consumer protection as if I were a UK citizen? Is there any way around this? I guess my best option is to pay with a credit card that charges no FX fees e.g. Barclaycard Rewards?

t3_1fpsmu6,Did we get screwed over by our hotel in Barcelona?,"We did a tour in Spain with additional hotel stays, our Madrid hotel experience was flawless, they provided a lot of services for us for no extra charge like getting us tickets to museums, but in Barcelona we felt we were getting constantly screwed over. They charged us a tax first thing, which I guess is a thing there, they also charged us to hold our luggage since we got to the room too early. We didn't have any of these charges in Madrid.

The biggest one is we asked the hotel to call a taxi because we couldn't see any outside the hotel. Everyone told us we could do this so we assumed it was not a problem. We told the front desk to schedule a taxi to the airport 30 minutes from now so we could go up and finish packing. When we arrived at the airport the price was really high, like double or more what it should have been for a 20 min trip. Turns out the front desk didn't schedule the taxi in 30 minutes, but told the taxi to be there right away, so we got charged for 30 minutes of waiting. The taxi driver also told us there was a fee from the hotel for calling the taxi, which they didn't tell us about. We couldn't really do anything to dispute the bill so we just paid and left.

Is this a normal thing that we just weren't aware of? Or was the hotel screwing us over? I find it hard to believe because they were so nice and asked us to leave a review."

And recommendations would be welcome, details below.

Flying from London with UK passports.

5-19th Oct (this can't be changed due to job commitments). It doesn't have to take this entire period, but would need to fall within it.

Interests: food, nature, beach would be ideal. Fairly active/adventurous. Not interested in nightlife. Can handle a few museums/galleries but not bothered either way.

Caveats: needs minimal planning as this will be a last minute dash. Ideally no driving... We can drive, it's just usually driving on the other side of the road being from the UK *internal scream*

Already been to: Germany, Spain, Gran Canaria, Portugal, France, Sicily, Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Crete, Cyprus, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, New York, Vancouver

t3_1fq1psy,You might be doing solo travel wrong…,"See a lot of posts here and r/solotravel about folks disliking solo travel because they’re spending their whole trips alone. 

If you want to be alone solo traveling, that’s great! But if you’re new to solo trips and like to socialize, putting in effort to make new friends is part of the experience. There are a lot of ways to do this, so I thought I’d spitball some of the things I do to meet both travelers and locals when I travel alone.

- Hostels: The most straightforward way to make friends, always loads of other solo travelers in these environments who are quite open to new connections.

- Food/walking tours: Most tourist towns have ‘free’ walking tours where other travelers congregate, and the tours are really conducive to conversation.

- Language exchanges: Very common at hostels (you don’t have to be a guest!) and restaurants/bars in many cities, language exchanges can be a great way to meet locals who want to practice new languages and for you to pick up some of the local lingo yourself.

- Couchsurfing: If you’re nervous about staying at a stranger’s house, Couchsurfing also offers meetups in public places where locals interested in showing travelers around come and hang out. I’ve been shocked how easily I’ve met local people who are really enthusiastic about inviting me into their lives, I think for some who don’t have the time or means to travel this is a way for them to experience some of the fun and spontaneity of travel in their home towns.

- Hobbies: Sharing your mutual interests is IMO the most organic way to make new friends. I love to draw and often bring my sketchbook to have a few drinks at the local bar. I’m almost always approached by other artists or laypeople curious about my art.

It’s not for everyone but I am an avid salsa dancer and currently traveling in Latin America where there are socials in most towns I visit. The dance floor is an intentionally open environment and a comfortable place to show up alone and come away with a bunch of new local friends who share your passion. 

Regardless of what hobby you love, there are always classes or meetups in most places; or you could try picking up something new while you’re on the road.



Curious if other Redditors have different approaches for socializing on their solo travels they’d like to share here for inspiration. I kind of shake my head when I see posts saying “I traveled to Kazakhstan and am staying in a hotel alone and haven’t tried to learn the language, I’m lonely and decided I don’t like solo traveling!”. 

It‘s ok that solo isn’t for everyone but if you want to share these trips with new friends you have to take an active role in cultivating that experience. Don’t knock solo traveling just cause you’re doing it wrong!"

t3_1fpdzxd,Singapore vs US/UK/Canada for a first-time solo female traveller. A matter of waiting a budget.,"I'm from South Africa, and want to start saving and planning for an international holiday. The only time I've ever left the country was in 2005 as a 10-year-old to go to Taiwan on a school trip. While my heart wants to go to the US or UK the most, there are so many hurdles to that. Firstly, there are staunch visa requirements for us, and as a self-employed freelancer with no kids or assets, visas are even harder to get for me. It's doable, but it would involve spending way more money because I'd have to go for interviews at the consulate, which would mean flights or long road trips in itself because I'm nowhere near any of those visa offices. So, money is obviously the biggest factor for that, coupled with our way lower exchange rate, I'd have to save for at least 2 years to go on a worthwhile trip. I'd want to be there for at least 2-3 weeks so I can explore as much as possible given the size of the country, but ideally a month. The same goes for Canada and the UK.

OR, I could go to Singapore (where I don't need a visa), and even though it's also expensive, it has a lot of western influence and I feel like it's as close as I could get to the US without visa requirements. I could spend a week in Singapore and only have to save up for around 6 months. It just kinda feels disingenuous to go to a culture-rich destination like that when I'm not really interested in the local culture, cuisine, etc. I'd be going to go to Universal Studios, try Five Guys and Shake Shack, visit IKEA, the zoo, super trees, sky walk, and their train system (I love trains) and maybe some sightseeing bus tours.

Which road would you take?"

t3_1fp66k4,What are some of your most recommended places when people ask you for suggestions?,"Not quite the same question as what your actual favorite places are.

I (probably like a lot of people in this sub) get asked for recommendations from people I know in real life,  usually framed as ""Gee you're always traveling somewhere! We were talking about a trip to somewhere in Europe in 2025 after Jeff retires! Any recommendations?"" or ""We want to go somewhere cool you're always going cool places where should we go?"" or ""I've literally never left the US but I've saved up 2k and 2 weeks of vacation where should I go?"" And it's fun to ask them what they've liked and find something similar-but-not-to-similar.

The first one from EDI to Stansted which arrives at midnight, and the second one from Stansted to Spain at 9am the next morning. I will camp out in Stansted airport for those 9 hours and was wondering if I have to leave the Gates and re-enter through security or if I can just stay at the Gates once I have arrived, like a normal connecting layover, waiting for my next flight? I won‘t have checked bags, just my hand luggage.
I know RyanAir doesn’t technically do connecting flights, but since there is so much time between my two flights and I‘m travelling with hand luggage only, I was wondering if staying at the Gates is possible. I have only ever been to Stansted once and that was a long time ago, so I don’t know the airport too well.

Please don’t tell me to book an airport hotel, I know that’s an option, I just want to save money and know the risks and the horrors of staying in an airport overnight, it won’t be comfortable but it was the cheapest and easiest option for me this time."

t3_1fpuvs1,Taxes on bringing liquor to Canada from Mexico,"It is hard to find an answer online so hopefully someone can provide some insight. I purchased a 1L bottle of mezcal as a gift in Mexico and I was not provided a proper tax receipt. I paid with card for 800mxn and I believe the lady who sold it to me said taxes would not be paid if I paid with card. 

As far as I am aware, I have not paid taxes on the bottle. It is 45% alcohol. If I cannot provide a proper receipt at customs in Mexico, will they give me trouble? Or perhaps they will ask me to pay the taxes at the border? 

I have to put the bottle in my girlfriend’s checked bag as I only brought a carry on with me, and I don’t want to deal with the trouble of having her stopped and questioned. 

I am considering just abandoning the bottle and buying one in duty free to avoid any hassle.

Can any frequent travellers to Mexico provide some insight as to whether I will be stopped for a single bottle of mezcal?"

t3_1fpf9a5,"Da Nang,Vietnam for 8 months ","Last year we have left the beautiful place called Da Nang where my boyfriend and I spent incredible 8 months.We decided to move to Vietnam just for a month and ended up staying longer than we thought we would.
The city itself has a lovely beach that has white sand and adorable little crabs that I enjoyed looking at.
It is less crowded than Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City which makes it perfect for people who like nature but also want to have some activities and modern city environment.
Together with that, Da Nang has a lot of foreigners and we ended up going to different events from Halloween to Holi festival where we had a great time and met new friends.Vietnamese people are also quite friendly and very kind,we felt really comfortable and welcomed there.
There are a lot of restaurants and cafes that offer a lot of different cuisines and dishes.We have tried Vietnamese and other cuisines,and there is also a night market in the city where you can try a lot of fresh seafood.
It was easy to move around the city since we rented a bike,so we were able to explore a lot of places in and around Da Nang.There are a lot of cool things to see,but for us the most memorable places were:
1.Lady Buddha 
2.Marble mountains
3.Hoi An(city nearby)
4.Monkey mountain
5.My Khe beach
6.Dragon Bridge
7.Hai Van Pass road

Stayed at big fancy hotel near Central Park last visit and found ourselves leaving almost everyday and while the spacious room was nice and the walkable distance to Central Park was nice we much more enjoyed the other parts of the city. Therefore we figured we’d invest less on a hotel and more on other things.

Ideally, we’d like to explore the forest/see the nature and wildlife but I’m not sure how viable that is without a car. I’ve seen people discuss renting bikes from Brokenhurst but I’m not sure if that’s just for transiting about the town or if that allows for exploration “into the forest”. 

I guess my question is what can we actually access by either bike or walking/hiking? Similarly, is Brockenhurst the *ideal* destination or would we be better served choosing one of the other stops in that area?

t3_1fpryur,Airline Refuses to Refund Return Ticket After Canceling Departure - Feeling Cheated,"Hey everyone,

I’m in the UAE and I'm feeling super frustrated and could really use some advice. A few weeks ago, I booked a round-trip flight package to Beirut from Abu Dhabi through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) on Etihad Airlines. The airline ended up canceling my *departure flight* because of the situation in Lebanon right now and initiated the refund for that leg of the journey. However, they did **not cancel my return flight** and are now refusing to refund me for it.

They claim that because the tickets have **different reference numbers**, the return flight isn’t eligible for a refund. But when I booked, it was a package deal – I bought them *together* and wasn’t given the option to buy just one ticket. Now they’re saying the reference numbers are what matters, even though I never got the chance to buy these flights separately in the first place!

I feel like this is some sort of cheating as I won't be able to be in Beirut to actually go back on the returning  Any advice on how to get a refund for the return ticket that I obviously can’t use now?

Thanks!

Departure flight: EY535  
Returning flight: EY582

EDIT: I know my problem is with [booking.com](http://booking.com) they are the ones who are refusing to refund me as they sold me the package. that's why I'm asking if there's anything I can do to sort it out with them if anybody had a similar experience of if filing a dispute works in this case since I didn't receive the initial offered service."

Would it be recommended to use the train and public transit or a car? It doesn't look like trains save much time, and sometimes it is faster to drive, depending on the destination. We can rent a car in Geneva and return it in Vienna, which would be convenient. I just don't know which would be better price-wise. We obviously can't predict the price of fuel in 8-9 months, but I also know that even with the Swiss Half Pass, the cost of trains and other public transport will start to add up, especially as we want to do some of the more remote hikes like Oeschinen Lake.

  
We went to Scotland in 2023 and we did not have a rental car, and it really hindered us because there was a massive tube strike going on. We were supposed to have a car, but got denied because we were under 25 at the time.

Whenever I’ve flown short haul with BA all we’ve ever gotten was a bottle of water and a chocolate biscuit bar.

t3_1fxnfj0,What countries or destinations do you think have the most tourism potential/are going to blow up in the future?,"I think China truly has a massive amount of potential for tourism. Excellent food, historical sites, and scenery. The market there at the moment is currently very focused on the domestic market, which makes sense when there is such huge domestic demand and a lack of English proficiency. As population decline hits China and it becomes more willing to accept foreign tourists, I presume it could become a huge market. Sichuan, Tibet, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhangjiajie have huge draws.

This is more of a fantasy of mine, that likely won't come true as it's so far away from Europe and Asia, but Chile has incredible tourism potential. Patagonia, cruises, vineyards, and great food."
t3_1fy2dpd,The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

Of course, I also want to hear about major events and festivals that are spectacular; I love the idea of La Tomatina or the Holi festival in India.

What are some great festivals and events in your country or in the world for next year?"
t3_1fxh1n0,Phone found in bag - scam?,"My friend and I are in Zagreb at the Museum of Broken Relationships, when we heard a phone ringing. We were wondering who didn’t have their ringer off, when she realized it was in her purse (a crossbody sling type bag). It was a strange phone ringing with no background on the Lock Screen and a plain case. It had a couple of notifications but they were not in English. She took it to the museum front desk and is now having an existential crisis about how this even happened and why. Has anyone heard of any scams that this could be or have any explanations? It’s such an odd thing to happen. "

My first purely personal (i.e. not for business) trip internationally.
I loved every single minute of it. From the food to the people, I couldn't make a single complaint. 
There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").
I wasn't sure what to expect but I had the time of my life."

Looking for other suggestions for and experience with ""theme-based"" US road trips exploring a bunch of sites all tied to a common theme (such as historical events, natural sites, culture, etc.) as opposed to exploring random sites simply following one road (e.g. Route 66, Loneliest Road, Hwy 101 coast, etc.).

t3_1fy23b7,Maldives - Best local island for snorkeling right off the beach??,"My wife and I are planning to stay on a local island for 6 nights February. We'd like to choose one where the house reef is great for snorkeling right off the beach. The idea is to spend most of our time snorkeling independently without needing to book snorkeling (not interested in diving trips. Looking for easier current, we can both swim but i am less water confident / fit.

The three other factors important to us are:

- At least a few Food options at reasonable prices

- island transfers not more than 1.5 hours from Male by speedboat (but we may take public ferries,)

- A laidback vibe (with a few bits to walk around see but not expecting too much)

We have already booked Dhigurgh for whale shark and those types of trips beforehand. This is for after that 

Our research is pointing us to Fulidhoo, or Dhiffushi, and at a push Thodoo, but i need to look at Ukulhas maybe too

How would you rate these? Any other islands I should consider, given the context?

Any thoughts and recommendations would be immensely helpful. Thanks in anticipation!"

Whenever I ask about all inclusive resorts, most people think of going to an island.  I’m looking for something easy and drivable from the Philly area -  Catskills, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia, etc. We do go to Woodloch Pines in the Poconos every year, just looking to mix it up with something different. 

I also want to make sure the teenagers are occupied. A lot of family resorts are geared towards little kids so I want to make sure there is enough for teenagers to do. My husband and I are easy, we just want to relax. I want to avoid getting on a plane (I travel a lot for work) and not worry about anything. 

Would love any and all suggestions.

t3_1fy4zyj,ESTA Denied (HU Citizen),"Hey guys,

I got my ESTA application denied today within an hour of applying. Probably less.
I checked my details and they are correct, apart from me putting down my Personal Identification Number as National Identification Number. That may be the reason.

Circumstances:
- I have dual nationality (Serbian by birth)
- I don't have Hungarian ID card

The latter relates to the National Identity Number issue, in case they need the ID Card Number. 

Any similar issues/cases?

t3_1fy4rhm,Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

t3_1fy48oo,Title: Planning a 1-2 Year Solo Trip as an Indian — Visa Advice Needed!,"Hey everyone!

I’m an Indian traveler planning to kick off a 1-2 year solo backpacking adventure starting early next year. My idea is to begin in Europe, hop around for a few months, then head to South America, and eventually explore parts of Asia.

# Here’s a bit more about my plan:

* **Where I’m starting:** India (currently based here).
* **When I’m leaving:** Hoping to start around late November to early December. Pretty flexible on dates.
* **Budget:** Trying to keep it around $1,000-$1,500/month, give or take.
* **What I want to do:** I’m all about meeting locals, exploring hidden gems, and experiencing different cultures. Definitely want to mix city life with nature, maybe do some volunteering or work exchanges along the way too.
* **What I’ve figured out so far:** I know the Schengen visa only allows 90 days in 180 in Europe, which is going to be tricky. South America seems a bit easier, but I’m still figuring out the specific requirements. And Asia will probably be a mix depending on the country.

# My question:

Anyone else dealt with the whole visa issue as an Indian passport holder while trying to do long-term travel? How did you work around the restrictions, especially in Europe? Are there any countries that are more chill with long stays? I’d love to hear from anyone who’s navigated this or has some solid advice to share!

Also, if there are any fellow Indians who’ve managed to make a trip like this happen, I’d be super grateful to hear your experiences and how you tackled the visa stuff.

Thanks a lot, and safe travels!"

t3_1fy42a8, Help with Spain Itinerary and Travel Timing,"Hi everyone!

The wifey &amp; I are planning a trip to Spain in either March or April and could use some advice. We’ll be landing at Madrid airport and plan to do the entire trip using train to commute from city to city.. Here’s what I’m considering:

**Timing:**

* Is March a better choice due to lower crowds and costs, despite being colder? I’ve heard April might be crowded due to school holidays and Easter. Is the warmer weather worth the extra expense? How about May? Will things be more expensive then?

**Itinerary:** 

* We’re planning to visit:
   * **Madrid (4 days)**
   * **Granada (2 days)**
   * **Seville (3 days)**
   * **Valencia (2 days)**

  
Does this order make sense? Are the number of days in each city sufficient, or would you recommend any changes? We would like to do the trip in 10-11 days.

**Day Trips:**

* How about day trips to Toledo and Córdoba? Are they worth the time?
* Should we include Malaga too?

**Other Tips:**

* Is there anything else we should keep in mind while planning? For now we plan to cover just the southern part of Spain.

Thanks in advance for your help!"

t3_1fy0s0c,Need advice on my Vietnam itinerary,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are planning a trip to Vietnam from January 30th to February 10th next year. We’ve already booked our tickets, which were a great deal, but I overlooked the fact that our trip coincides with the Tet celebrations. We’re feeling a bit anxious about how the first few days might go, so we’d love some feedback from anyone with more experience in Vietnam during this time.

Here’s our itinerary:

* **January 30:** Arrive at Hanoi airport, then take a private transfer to Tam Coc, Ninh Binh. We should arrive by 4 PM, so we’ll keep it low-key—grab a meal, walk around, and acclimatize after the flight.
* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

We’re wondering if we’ll be able to arrange private transfers during Tet and whether the weather will be warm enough to enjoy the beaches in Da Nang and Hoi An at that time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

t3_1fy3ah1,How to salvage a curtailed vacation ,"Say your vacation’s tomorrow, everything’s booked, you’ve checked in, you’re packing. Then domestic disaster strikes and you can’t go. 

A few days later, the problem is fixed. With a few tweaks, it’s still possible to go on the second half of the vacation. But booking new outbound flights at such notice is very expensive. The cost can be afforded, but not comfortably. 

What would you do?

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip. Hundreds of dollars have been lost on non-refundable flights and accommodation, with nothing to show for it, but at least you’ll effectively reclaim some of it through saved expenditure on meals and attractions whilst out there"

I have have more time available (26 days), than the length of the tour (18 days). So, I have arranged to arrive 4 days earlier and leave 4 days later than the rest of the tour group. In the first 4 days. I am flying to see iguazu falls. Should be cool and fine. So far so good.  
For the last 4 days... December 26-29.. I am contemplating flying to Salta to explore. This would give me  2-1/2 to 3 days there.. leaving out flying time. 

The tour itself will go to the parana' delta area , rocoleta cemetery area, explore one or two neighborhoods in Buenosaires and gives us about half a day that is unstructured and on our own. This doesnt seem like much time to see the city. before we the fly off to Patagonia.   

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool. In the later option I would probably lose a day due to flying.. (the flight is only 2 hours, but to get to airport and out of airport twice etc.. will shoot most of a day.

I also considered taking a ferry to Uruguay and renting a car, but I read that Uruguay is quite sedate.... So.. Uruguay? Buenos Aires more in-depth or Salta?  

BTW, this will be my first time ever in South America. and I do not speak Spanish.  
but, I am a relatively experienced traveller.

However, this brings interesting challenges. 

Without getting too far into it, my daughter is fed through a feeding tube connected to her stomach. She has to be connected to her pump for 20 hours a day. I understand her pump and medications can be carried on or even checked for free due to them being medical devices. 


One other challenge is she requires special formula we can’t buy at grocery stores and will need to bring a complete supply with us. Can this be considered medical or will we have to check a bag full of formula? 

I have a CPAP machine as well, could we have one large “medical bag”?

t3_1fxrmv5,sabbatical travel from Canada,"So next year I'm on sabbatical. When I say next year, I basically mean September 2025 to June 2026 (I'm a teacher...that's a year for me with summer being a bonus!lol)

I'm hoping to travel as much as my money will allow. We live in Montreal. My son is off one week in November and one week in April (Easter) so I'm looking for a destination with him. He will be 15 and obsessed with Disney. We have already been to the Florida and California ones. He wants to be an imagineer when he's older. Some ideas: Paris with Disneyland, a Disney cruise from Florida, Greece (he's also into mythology and Percy Jackson). He's not a picky eater which is good for traveling and loves museums. 

My daughter will have the first three weeks of January off. She will be 18 and is very easy going. Not really into museums. She wants to learn how to surf and is super into Asian culture (but Japan is a no no which will be explained later). I was thinking Vietnam, Costa Rica, a cruise, New Zealand, a cruise, etc. We can also do a group thing (Intrepid or G adventures). She will not travel somewhere where she needs an extra vaccine! lol!

At some point during my break I'm planning on going to Japan with my husband. Just the two of us. We aren't sure when, probably October or early March (before blossoms). I think we should add South Korea since it's close.

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I am not bound to specific vacation times like when I'm teaching. Usually I can only travel during the summer (which is too bad since we have great weather here and have a pool we like to enjoy), Christmas or March break.

Any ideas? "
t3_1fxyeul,Help with Mexico FMM,"Hey all! So the situation I’m in currently is this
I came to Mexico on a one way flight, stayed for  5 days (counting tomorrow when I’m supposed to leave), and am leaving on the bus tomorrow. Do I need to fill out the digital multiple migratory form in order to leave? If so how? 
There isn’t an option that I can find for entry by air. And the link on my ticket leads to a 404 error, QR code unscannable due to not being printed correctly."
t3_1fwo3rv,Croatia Road Trip 2024,"This summer I went on a trip to Croatia with my family. We rented a car and went from Zagreb all the way to Dubrovnik. Here’s a summary.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

t3_1fxxo14,A week in Vienna or a week in Catania??,"I am a 60 year old female who is used to solo travel and love it.

What should I expect/my mentality be going into this? I’ve always wanted to get to know with other people and idk if there are social circles for that.

The challenge is that we're forced to do it during Christman &amp; New Year's (I know, I know) because of scheduling. From what I can tell, we'll be paying 4x the amount, which sucks, but it's the only thing that can work.  So, if there's a way to balance keeping costs down wherever we can vs. might as well enjoy it since we're gonna pay too much, I'm all ears.  
The places that seem geographically viable are the Canary Islands, Various spots in the Carribean, or the south of Spain, but we're open to any suggestions within these places or beyond them.  Would appreciate any advice.

t3_1fxnfc4,How to setup a trip through the Pacific Northwest in August with a toddler,"We are a couple with a 3 year old kid and I’m in charge of suggesting an itinerary for a trip next August. 

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

t3_1fxje3h,Trying to protect myself but need some pointers...,"So I am flying to Japan from the UK for a week, then off to Korea after for another week. I am due to fly in 4 weeks time, but 2 weeks ago, I was informed my flight out of the UK was now going to fly later and therefore my connecting flight to Tokyo would have to be cancelled as I would miss it.

Initially I was offered a flight 24 hours later but I found one with the same airline that flies two hours later and asked if I could get on that one instead. 

Its been 2 weeks and I am still waiting to hear if that is ok, but there are no other flights available. So my question is, if they can't get me on alternative flights, can I claim the cost of the trip through my holiday insurance? I am getting very nervous I am going to loose a lot of money if I can't get out there."

t3_1fxiin4,Where to Travel in November,"I am looking for some advice on where to travel this November. I am coming from Canada and wanting to go somewhere in Western Europe from the 10th - 24th and have narrowed it down to five possible places: Scotland, Northern Spain, Germany (Bavaria specifically), Switzerland, or Austria. I am interested in hiking through mountains and being out in the nature in general, visiting Medieval towns and villages, visiting potential Christmas markets, and enjoying the cuisine/pub life of the locals. If weather permits, I am also interested in bike-riding, but I understand November may not be the best time of year for that and am okay with that fact. I also know that each of the countries I mentioned have different weather at that time of year, however I don't mind the cold/ a bit of overcast and rain at all, with Autumn being my favourite season. This all being said, I am hoping to get a bit of travel advice on where you'd reccomend I go. It would be greatly appreciated!"
t3_1fxib16,"2 weeks in India for a wedding in Bangalore, recs for another place to spend 5-6 nights?","Spouse and I will be in India for the last two weeks of December. We're flying in and out of Bangalore and we want to pick one other city/region of India to visit for 5-6 nights. 

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast. While sometimes we decide a full packed day is worth it, we often like to go out and do something, come back to the hotel and nap/chill, and go back out for the late afternoon/evening. So we're looking for a home base with lots of options for interesting things to do where it's easy to be a bit spontaneous. 

Right now Goa and Kerala have both piqued our interest for food/nature. Reddit, what would you suggest for us? Specific suggestions on places to stay/things to do would be super welcome. "
t3_1fwdjbg,Western NC ,"Do. Not. Come here. 

If you have a bnb scheduled for this fall/winter-cancel it. 

If you want to see the leaves- visit a state farther north. 

Want to hit the slopes this winter- they aren’t here anymore. 

If you want to come provide help- Thank you but please have it scheduled in advance with a reputable organization and do not plan on staying overnight as we need hotels/vacation rentals for displaced families who lost everything. 

If you want to come see the devastation with your own eyes- Fuck you

I have been living out of a backpack since Friday when me and my partners home was flooded. We are very fortunate and have a place to stay that enables us to continue providing support for our community. 

I am a social worker and my partner works for state government. For the sake of our recovery efforts do not come to Alleghany,Ashe, Avery, Mitchell, Watauga, Yancey counties as well as any counties adjacent to Buncombe (Asheville).

t3_1fxhv8m,"5 Day trip, is Medellin the right choice?","(23M) I have 3 remaining vacation days that I can use before the end of the year.  I want to do a Friday-Tuesday trip to LatAM in November (4 nights).

After analyzing flight prices and doing my own research, Medellin looks like the one of the cheapest options(from Toronto). And seems to be right up my alley in terms of what I am looking for, which is a big city, that also has some natural attractions to explore nearby.

Secondly, I have a couple language exchange partners that I have been speaking to from there, so I will (potentially) have some locals to help me.   


My question is, does 5 days (4 nights) seem like enough time for Medellin? Is there a better place you would visit if you were in my shoes? My second option was Buenos Aires, but this would be 30% more expensive and I would lose an extra 10 hours, with flying time. "

t3_1fxgsrz,Should I tweak my New Zealand Itinerary to add 1 night in Hawke's Bay?,"I am planning a return trip to New Zealand's North Island after doing a 2 week trip to the South Island last year. I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

I’m looking for travel recommendations, considering I’m based in Mexico and earn in Mexican pesos (MXN). I’ll be traveling with my partner, so we’re particularly interested in destinations that offer a great balance between affordability and amazing experiences. Our budget isn’t huge, so we’re hoping to find places where the cost of living, food, and activities won’t break the bank but still allow us to enjoy what we love.

Some preferences:

	•	We both love beach destinations and sporting events/places.
	•	Open to both domestic (Mexico) and international destinations.
	•	We enjoy outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and trying local food.
	•	Safety is also an important factor.

Any suggestions for cities, regions, or countries where the exchange rate or cost of living makes it easier for a couple earning in pesos to enjoy the beach and catch some sports? Thanks in advance for your advice!"

t3_1fxdr8n,2+ weeks in Guatemala and Belize,"Hi,

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

What doesn't make sense to me is the trip from Atitlan to Flores as it's a 10-12 hours journey. But then it makes sense to get from Flores to Belize.

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

Would you amend the time spend in any of the placea above? I hear mixed opinions about Semuc Champey so skipped it as it's a long journey.

What would be the best way to tackle this?"

t3_1fxgmu1,Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

t3_1fwwvac,Best country in African for Safari? ,"Looking for potential African safari vacation for my family.

Looking for my safari to be around a week give or take, in the summer months, so June or July. And really I just want to just see some nice wildlife. I’m also wondering if there’s any recommendations for certain national parks or game reserves. Or for specific tour guide companies/agencies. Additionally after the safari we want to go somewhere coastal we were thinking Zanzibar if we go to Tanzania, or Cape Town if we go to South Africa. I’ve heard the crime situation in South Africa is pretty bad, but I’m not sure how bad it really is because I know people (especially tourists) tend to exaggerate. I’ve been to a few third world countries already and am by no means one of those people who will avoid a country because of the crime factor, unless it’s truly really bad, (think like Syria, Somalia etc). Anyways, any recommendations will be appreciated!

t3_1fxk4un,Babymoon ideas for the Caribbean,"My husband and I are looking to go to an all-inclusive resort in the Caribbean in January. I will be between 25-29 weeks pregnant depending on when we end up going. I’ve already cleared it with my doctor, and she sees no issues with going. We went to the all-inclusive Sandals resort in Antigua last November and was not happy with it. Loved Antigua as a country and the views, water, etc. but not happy with the value of the resort for what we paid. 

We were looking for something not quite as expensive as Antigua for this next trip. We were thinking maybe Aruba, Jamaica, or Punta Cana. Any other suggestions? I love the pretty, crystal clear water. We are going to be focusing more on relaxing rather than excursions (since I won’t be able to do many). I hated having to rush to the beach/pool early in the morning in Antigua to get a chair for the day. I know not all resorts are like this. The food was also terrible in Antigua. We would just like this one to be special since it will likely be the last time going somewhere like this for several years. 

Just looking for input considering safety, views, relaxation, value for your money, etc. 

Thank you. "
t3_1fxq2uu,Machu Picchu weight loss,"Hey y’all! 

My family is looking at going to Peru to hike the Inca Trail this December around Christmas. I’m super pumped, I’ve always wanted to do this, so I have no objections. However, I’ve been thinking about the logistics, and am feeling a little bit hesitant now.

I am very concerned that I will lose weight during the hike. I’m vegan (I am willing to just be vegetarian during the hike for convenience), but I’m nervous that the food offerings will not be sufficient to replace all the calories lost during the days. I’ve also seen some people saying they became ill from either altitude, I’ll bring altitude pills, or the food. 

Obviously, I’m going to talk to the tour company we decide to book with just to make sure, but at the end of the day I cannot stand to lose anymore weight. If any of y’all have experience with the trail and lost/gained/maintained weight please let me know what company you went with and what the food situation looked like. 

Thank you so much!!"

I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. "

t3_1fwdhld,Why is my partner getting lower Booking rates for every hotel?,"So me and my partner are here sitting in bed, both with our phones open and using the Booking app, searching up dozens of identical hotels after I noticed that for our first few choices hers were all unanimously cheaper than what I was shown for the same property and same room.

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her. We’ve both been Booking members for almost the exact same amount of time, booked about the same amount (we go back and forth each trip), and are both at the same Genius level as well as the same amount of bookings away from reaching the next level.

What is going on here? I understand d A/B testing or selectively offering different locations and devices certain rates, but we are, for the most part, going into the searches with the exact same parameters.

Both on iPhones, same IP, same Genius level, about the same past spending.

And yet, she’s getting minor to massive discounts every time and I’m stuck more or less just paying the normal rate…

What’s going on?!

**Edit** : u/topfuckr (lol) broke the case wide open, it was 100% the gender choice. I switched my gender over to female and I immediately got all of my partner’s discount offers. “Female” and “Prefer not to say” yielded the discounts while “Male” and “Non-binary” gave me nothing.

**Edit 2** : Someone asked for screenshots (sorry about being late) so here are the shots of the property that set off this entire question:

[This is what the property](https://imgur.com/a/OvW2OPs) gave me when I was set as a male. When I set my profile to female [this is the discount I was then given.](https://imgur.com/a/Q58kwKy)

We are looking at visiting a small beach town that is a train ride from Barcelona (likely Sitges), but have been reading on this sub and others about the extreme heat in Spain in summer. 

So far, we're expecting a minimal itinerary: A walk in town, occasionally grab dinner, visit a beach or two. Because we're a large group, most places that can accommodate us are a drive away, or a good 30-minute walk, from the town centre or beach. So there would be some short distance travel involved with the itinerary. Have already looked at historic weather averages of Sitges and nearby towns, but it's hard to get a sense of what the heat is really like.

Will we run into any issues going out with an infant due to heat at this time of year? What should we be considering?

t3_1fx83sr,Customs in Jamaica- What do I need to declare? (If anything),"Hi all, I've never flown out of the US before, or traveled internationally on my own before. I'm also a bit of an overthinker at times. Going to Jamaica for a vacation- bringing a few different OTC meds (allergy meds, NSAIDs, Pepto, etc) and I am bringing some Jewelry. Do I need to declare these? I ask because one line on the declaration form is ""Pharmaceuticals, chemicals, narcotics and other illicit drugs or biological substances"" would OTC meds be considered pharmaceuticals? I feel like TUMS and Claritin are pretty far from narcotics, but I can't find anything that elaborates on this. Also, the line ""I have goods exceeding the value of my (our) personal duty-free allowance,"" with the allowance being around $1000 I believe. I'm under the impression that's more about travelers bringing things back to their home countries from a trip, but does that apply for visitors bringing things in that they will leave with? If I bring a laptop or piece of jewelry that is valued over $1000, would that need to be declared?"

It isn’t the perfect destination by any means but I found myself and so much wonder there and it was wonderful to me.

t3_1fx1slz,Philippines travel itinerary ,"Hey all, myself and my partner are wanting to go to the Philippines next year in November. We are flying from the UK and are initially going to stop over in Singapore for a few nights before flying to either Cebu or Manila. We will have about 11 nights total in the Philippines. 

Thinking if we fly into Manila, we take an internal flight straight away to El Nido. Stay there for 4 nights and take a boat tour to see Coron island. Any recommendations for which tour to do? I’ve seen there are 4 different ones to choose from.

Then flying to Bohol and spending 3 nights there.

After that taking the boat across to Cebu and spend the remaining 4 nights there.

Happy to have any suggestions or changes to the plan. This is just a rough idea as we are finding it quite hard the best way to travel away in the most efficient whilst seeing a few of the islands.

Thanks in advance!

t3_1fxl3yr,Cairo really doesn't deserve the bad reputation.... ,"As the title says

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

t3_1fx8f8a,"Last months of our trip, Nepal or more SEA ?","Hey travelers,

my girlfriend and I are in the last month of our one year world trip and have a hard decision to make.

So far we travelled Argentina/Bolivia/Peru/Chile/Columbia/Mexiko/Japan/South Korea and now are in Laos. Our original plan was to go to north Vietnam (Ha Giang Loop) after Laos and then fly to India for a month and afterwards to the Philippines in December cause we gonna met some friends there.

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

So its basically 

Vietnam/India/Philippines/New Zealand 

vs 

Nepal/India/Philippines/Vietnam or New Zealand

I know this is really about personal preferences but still we would be happy for some input from other travelers. Both North Vietnam and Nepal were affected by the current floods so we are quite unsure about that also. Is is even possible to do the three passes trek that spontaneous ? Also we are travelling with hand luggage and would have to buy/rent a lot of stuff in Nepal.

Thanks !

t3_1fxblxi,How is this Switzerland itinerary for Jan?,"Me and my family will be in Lyon over January and we want to spend a week in Switzerland. It'll be me + partner and 2 kids (6 and 10).

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)"
t3_1fxf5z8,Asked to pay for stained sheets by the hotel,"Hello, I spent 2 nights in a hotel in Thailand, and had a nose bleed during the night, which left 2 stains of blood on the sheets. The hotel is asking me to pay the equivalent of 70$ for housecleaning, which is way more than I paid for the room for 2 nights…. 

I obviously don’t want to pay, because blood stains can be washed and the sheets already had some stains (small but still) and I think the price is insane. It’s also not specified anywhere in the room the cost of any of the items if they were to replace them.

My strategy is to go tell them I’m not gonna pay for stains that can be washed and definitely not that much. The main issue is I have my passeport as deposit (I know stupid) so probably I’ll have to pay hopefully I can negotiate.

Please help me, what would you do in this situation? I’m so annoyed"
t3_1fwkv4m, Magic in Macedonia,"Macedonia took us by surprise. It’s not the first place people think of when they plan a Balkan trip, but man, it should be. We drove through Skopje, with its mix of old-world charm and modern quirks, and ended up camping by Lake Ohrid. The stillness of the lake, surrounded by mountains, had this calming effect—like you were in a different world.

One night, we met a group of Macedonian travelers who invited us to a small village festival. There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them. We nursed the van back to the nearest town, with every downhill stretch feeling like a gamble. A quick fix at another local garage got us going again, but it was a reminder that this adventure came with real risks."

I'm planning a trip to Europe for May of next year, where I will be traveling with my parents and sister for about 14 days. The current very rough outline is to fly into Prague, spending several days there and possibly adding day trips to Kutna Hora or other nearby towns. We would then make our way to Munich where we would also spend several days. We would end our trip in Switzerland, spending about a week there before flying out from Zurich. My questions are:

Are 14 days a viable amount of time for this plan?

Would it make more sense to rent a car or travel exclusively by train?

Are there any places along this general route that you would recommend visiting?

Where would you advise staying overnight or spending a day in Switzerland?

Our interests include sites with historical value such as old city centers, castles, etc, as well as museums and architecture.

In retirement planning, my wife and I want to continue to travel, but I have had recent realizations making me really think of how to do that once we're retired. We live in the USA. My worry is the realization that Medicare doesn't cover you if you're traveling to places like Europe or Asia. But at that age, it seems like a chance of an ER visit may be greater. Like if I'm 70 and had a heart attack, do you just screw yourself for the rest of your retirement? My current insurance provides health care abroad, but I'd hate to work to my death just for the health care. I'd also hate to not travel just for the chance I might have an ER visit. Do you just buy travel insurance for the trip to cover that? I've seen things like Faye but then I also read that they can be a pain to deal with and not pay out. thanks for any insight you all can provide. I've got a long time (25+ years) until I retire so this could be a completely different thing by then, but trying to be ahead of the game."

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport? Also does anyone know Denver airport well? Would we have to switch terminals in order to get to the domestic departures gate from the international arrivals gate? I know they have 6 terminals, but please also let us know the fastest method to get there and how long it would take. Thanks!"
t3_1fwtt9c,China Southern Airlines Website,"I'm booking a flight for my family and I see there are two sites: oversea.csair and b2c.csair. The prices are drastically different (oversea shows CAD and b2c shows Chinese yuan). The price difference for the same flight is \~$2600 for round trip on the oversea site and \~$6500 on the b2c site when converted to CAD.

What site do you use to book, I am confused on which one is legit.

t3_1fx54k8,"Heading To Saudi Arabia, Wrong Nationality on Visa","This is my second trip to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. I went there back in May.

I just received my new visa today (last one expired) and they have my nationality listed as the United Kingdom, but I'm an American citizen with a U.S. passport.

t3_1fwxabk,Mexico Itinerary,"Traveling to Cancun for a wedding in mid-November and luckily we have an extra week off to travel beforehand! Would appreciate any recommendations or insights regarding a fun itinerary. 

In general we like to move around a lot and see as much as we can during our travels. The wedding will involve several days being at an all-inclusive resort so we'll have some time them to lounge then.

We like unique cultural experiences, walking around cool neighborhoods, good food, and beautiful landscapes. We're not really ""beach people"" per se. 

With our extra week considering:

1) Mexico City - have been before and we loved it

2) Oaxaca - seems like it checks a lot of boxes

3) Tulum - always been on the list 

4) Merida / Chichen Itza

5) Pick a Spot Close to Cancun - Cozumel / Playa del Carmen / Holbox

PS - Seeing the Monarch Butterflies looks like an incredible experience but not sure if we'll be too early in early to mid November. If anyone has any experience doing this in November would love to hear about your experience!

  
Any advice and recommendations much appreciated!"

On both Premium Select and Comfort +, I had an aisle seat on the left. I'm petite (5'), so I did not notice a difference in leg/seat room for either. Taller ppl will probably feel a difference, so I've read. Premium select served meals using actual plates and utensils, but honestly, it didn't matter that I was using wooden cutlery with Comfort +. I think I read the tv screens are bigger in Premium too, but I did not notice a difference. In short, I'm glad I went w/ Comfort + and will choose it over Premium Select for future long-haul flights.

t3_1fwuyzx,3.5 weeks in Spain - any tips?,"Want to go to Spain next year in late September. Once I get it in my head to go somewhere, I need to plan it out on paper so I can stop obsessing over the dates 😆

Thinking we could do something like this...

Option 1:
- Arrive in Barcelona on 19 September - 6 nights 
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 1 night (breaking up the N to S journey)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 3 nights
- Fly home (13 October)

OR

Option 2:
- Arrive in Madrid on 11 September - 1 night to settle in
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 3 nights 
- Barcelona - 6 nights (quicker trip same day rather than having to arrive the night before directly from San Sebastian and lose a night there)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 1 night
- Fly home (6 October)

All domestic travel by train. 

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1. I thought it might feel a bit more relaxing though to have the 3 nights at the end. 

Keen for some feedback on these itineraries and if I'm giving too much or too little time in certain cities. 

The search function here will get a lot of use from me, but any tips or recommendations would be wholeheartedly welcomed! Our first time in Spain. Into the usual stuff: food, vibes, sights, walking aimlessly, local experiences, etc.  "

We’re tight on time, and trying to find a balance between seeing everything we really want to see and making sure we’re not constantly driving and rushing around. If we were to add a day, should we spend more time at pictured rocks, spend more time on Mackinac island, or try tahquamenon falls?

t3_1fw3r80,Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else. "
t3_1fx4okn,Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues. Orbitz doesn't even need to admit any error. But they do need to fix it.

Based upon your reading of the above text, how much of a leg (%-wise) do I have to stand on in my dispute?"

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right? (Worse case he just uses PayPal to send me money to my account, but you know)"

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both?

t3_1fwkuuu,The Call of the Road (Croatia),"I remember the first time we hit the road in that old T4 van. Croatia was our starting point, and the Adriatic coast didn’t disappoint. We cruised through winding coastal roads, with the sea sparkling on one side and dramatic cliffs on the other. Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot. A small mechanic in a nearby village became our savior, and after a few laughs (and a couple of beers shared while he worked), we were back on the road. Lesson learned: always befriend the locals."

t3_1fvoezl,"The Underrated Gems of Cáceres &amp; Merída, Spain","Extremadura is a region in SW Spain that even Spaniards don't visit that much. I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

Both cities are easily accessible by direct train from Madrid and Seville. I can't recommend them more highly!"

t3_1fwg3ws,I  need travel destination ideas for a memorable trip with my grandparents. My grandfather was just diagnosed with mild Parkinsons. I don't know how long he will be able to travel as that progresses.  ,"**About travelers**:

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. "
t3_1fwaiob,Help with last minute beach trip to get our minds off the hurricane ,"We were supposed to go to italy for one month but unfortunately the hurricane hit us (thankfully we are okay!) We've had a very emotionally/physically draining week helping friends who were less lucky, and my husband being a first responder. 

I tried to move our italy flight to next week but they would not honor the flight difference in airfare. We did get the flight credit but will have to just take the trip later. We want to still use our vacation time that we have, so looking to still book something to leave next week and with as little stress/planning as possible. Please help!!

My idea is book 1-2 week beach trip, stay in one location that's walkable to beach/town and just relax. 

Criteria:
-great beaches
-cute/nice town that would be walkable 
-safe
-relatively cheap 
-family friendly (we have a 1 year old)
-flight is hopefully direct or not too long (due to 1 year old) 

We've been to Belize, Costa Rica, Mexico. LOVED Costa Rica but want to travel international somewhere new. Considering maybe Ecuador or Aruba but would love to hear your favorite places. "

I wasn’t previously aware that the hotel functioned as a homeless shelter in 2020 during the pandemic.

Here's the thing though: I love banking on sky miles with Delta and we both have accounts. It's also easy to book by using your skymiles number.

When I do purchase the tickets, I will be prompted to put in both of our numbers. Is there a way to do this without alerting him of the ticket purchase? Delta emails you when you have a flight booked.

Also, what's a fun way to give the tickets? My favorite gifts are the gifts of experiences and this will be my biggest feat yet. Any fun ideas? What have you guys done?"

t3_1fwj8tm,Collecting checked bag in Frankfurt and checking it for a separate flight 2 hrs later. Tips?,"I had to check my bag from Athens to Frankfurt (on Aegean). I need to check it again for Frankfurt to Seattle (on Condor) 2+ hours later. I asked in Athens and it was not possible for them to check it through. 

I thought it might be worth asking here for any tips to make that go as smoothly as possible.

I am non Schengen. I assume that I must stand in line and go through customs to do this, as if I am leaving the airport. I’ll collect at bag claim, then queue again at bag drop for Condor, and again to go back through security. Am I missing anything, and is there anything you can share that might make this go more smoothly? Is bag claim for Aegean very far from bag drop for Condor?

Should a couple of hours for this be enough? I’m a little nervous because before this trip I hadn’t checked a bag in 25 years, and in Athens I had to wait 45 minutes in a sauna for my bag to come out. I remember why it’s best to not check bags."

March 2025 is when I'll be done with my grad school program, and as a reward I want to go on a solo travel for up to two weeks. I have several destinations that I have in mind and things I want to do there, and wanted to get estimates on how long it would take me for the stuff I want to do plus anything else you guys might suggest. I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum
* The Scottish highlands, Wales, the Lake District, Cornwall, the Cotswolds

**4. Japan (1.5 weeks?)**

Similiar to UK, I wanted to stay in Toyko initially, But I feel there's so much to explore in Japan. Really want to fit in time to visit an onsen at least for two days, and do stuff between Toyko and Osaka? Full list of things I want to do:

* Eat tons of sushi, ramen, curry, tempura bowls, and even a fugu sashimi
* Visit to Studio Ghibli Museum
* Visit to Tokyo tower
* Shibuya
* Onsen Trip, as I mentioned
* Shopping for some tax-free items cheaper compare to US; Maybe a Gundam Figure build kit or a Gibson Guitar?"

I booked a Bus to Denizli to see Pammukale and a flight to back to Istanbul and take my Return flight o LAX on October 10th, however, my main concern is that the travel Agency will Cancel my Returning Ticket for whatever reason they want to

We want to see the Alps, so I was thinking Zermatt or Andermatt. Here's a small list of things that we hope to see in the week we're there: 

- A Christmas market 

- The alps/mountains 

- Zurich for a little bit

I honestly don’t enjoy travelling as much if I would have to frequently move hotels/cities. Despite the rainy season, I still would like to visit the beach when possible.

I’ve had a look at these places and have listed out the particular ones that I would like to visit.

In Bali, I find Gili T, Nusa Penida, Ubud and Uluwatu nice but considering I’m only going for a week I would probably leave Gili T and Nusa Penida out. I am considering Bali but it honestly is my last option as how touristy it is kind of turns me off.

In Vietnam, I would really like to visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Hoi an. I am not sure if this is too many places for one week. Phu quoc is also on the list but I’ve heard it is a tourist trap (?)

Thailand. I haven’t really looked at a particular place in Thailand yet but I am considering visiting Thailand as it would be the “best” time to visit. It would be great if anyone could suggest a 7 day itinerary that won’t include moving around to too many different cities or getting on several domestic planes.

Disclaimer: Maybe this should be for r/ AskA""Nearly""Canadian, but I couldn’t find that particular group! Askacanadian moderated it out and the immigration reddits dont seem to cover it , so apologies for posting something oddly specific in r/travel 

I’m looking to book a sunny getaway this winter for my partner and me from Canada. I noticed there are several countries that a Canadian Permanent Resident can visit with their PR card and passport, even if the passport isn’t super powerful.

Has anyone traveled from Canada to any of these places (with PR card in hand + their *weak* national passport)? Are some more relaxed than others? Any tips or things to avoid (besides the usual travel advice)? I know I need to do more research once we decide, but I’m hoping for some personal experiences with immigration etc., like *how you fared with your all-inclusive trip to Cancun with Transat* or something(definitely avoiding USA stopovers!).

It was never an issue for me with my strong European passport, but I gather it might be trickier for someone with a weaker one like my better half. I just want to understand all the angles before getting her hopes up!

t3_1fw7sg0,Did I get scammed? ,"So I recently canceled a hotel reservation with Expedia. I called the hotel and they gave me a number to call: (888) 432-7981.

Seemed legitimate but due to being impacted by hurricane Helene, I couldn’t provide the confirmation code due to no service or WiFi (called via landline). They gave me a different number and gave me a 50% refund.

This week I had signal and wanted to see if I could get the other 50% as it would be helpful considering the hurricanes impact on us. Called the number above and they worked to see what they could do. They offered me credits for the other half and told me that it would be a $99 service fee for this since it was a manual refund. 

I believe I started to be scammed here.

I gave them my credit card info (I don’t think I should have done this looking back), and they sent me an email from: reservations@thebookingconfirmation.com. It was a receipt and information but it looks shady. The charge on my credit card also shows as: airtktservices(followed by a number). 

What really made me think I just got scammed is they said I would have to call a specific number in order to use the credits: +1-844-202-1445.

When I look for the credits on my account, I do not see them, nor do I have anything from Expedia confirming this in the app.

In New Zealand, we’d likely be planning on doing a tour of Hobiton since we’re both Lord of the Rings geeks, and hopefully enjoying some nature or hiking. If anyone has specific suggestions to tailor our plans, I’d love to hear your thoughts! "

t3_1fw6xem,Best GPS app that is up to date on road closures?,"Hey everyone. I hate to ask this at such a time, after Hurricane Helene and the tragedy that befelled some of my favorite communities of the world, but unfortunately work goes on. 

I'm based in central TN and often travel to NC for work reasons. I know that much, if not most, of western NC roads are closed down, but on google maps (my usual navigation app), it doesn't seem to be accounting for these road closures in the routes it's showing me. At least, it doesn't seem to match up with what I'm seeing on NC's official state website.

Anyone know of a better app?"
t3_1fw6nft,"I Need Advice With My Travel Itinerary (Beer Trip, Focusing on Belgium) — It's My 1st Time In Europe","Next year, I'll be taking a 22-day solo trip around Europe to celebrate my 40th birthday, starting with **Belgian Beer Weekend and ending with Oktoberfest**. My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi. But if I stay in Vleteren, I'll be able to walk there and back, depending on the distance between the hotel and In De Vrede. What do you think is the best way to proceed here?
2. The following day, Tuesday, I'm going to Florenville to visit Orval, in a journey over 5 hours.  So, would you advise me to leave from Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper, Vleteren or whatever?

If you have any tips on beer stores or beers you like to drink that I could buy, I'd be grateful.  
And I hope you can help me clear up my doubts about my itinerary and help me plan my trip."
t3_1fw6j1n,Holbox in the rain?,"Hi there! I'm booked to stay in Isla holbox in Mexico for 5 days next week, however, the weather is looking like thunderstorms and rain. I've heard mixed reviews about whether it's worth going despite the weather? Would appreciate any advice"
t3_1fw66fy,Can I changed my flight on a partnered airline (JAL) to a flight that is no longer in partnership with the first airline (AA)?,"I used the chase portal to book an American Airline flight to Tokyo Narita. This specific flight is in partnership with Japan Airline and is operated by JAL as well. 

I recently received an email from both AA and JAL saying my flight was changed. In the JAL email, they proposed to have my flight destination changed to HND instead, which would be great for me. I went through their process and booked the new flight. 

However this new flight is NOT in partnership with AA. At the confirmation page, I receive the following message (screenshot). When I check in my AA app, I see both flights been included (where the JAL flight doesn’t have a corresponding AA flight number)

Want to ask: 1) is it possible to pay for an AA flight and make a change to a JAL flight not in partnership with AA? 2) what’s the right next step here? Worst case scenario would be to have my original flight canceled and the new flight not go through. 

(Ps I have contacted AA already who’s not been helpful and basically said we can change your flight for $xx)"
t3_1fwdxdh,Where to travel from after Rome?,"Hey all, so I'm graduating next May from college and am planning on doing a 2-week long trip with my girlfriend. We'll be doing the Lauterbrunnen Valley, Florence, and Rome in that timespan. However, I would like to extend my trip by a bit longer (my girlfriend unfortunately will not be able to join me as she works full time and won't have the vacation time to do so). I think for my budget I have about $4000 planned for the entire 3-week trip, I also have no issue staying in a hostel provided its safe and clean. Here's what my interests:

Desires:

Good Nature

Cultural scene

budget friendly

Not too difficult to fly back to the USA from.

I was thinking of maybe:

French Riviera (although that may be too expensive - honestly not sure as I haven't looked too deeply at prices for that area)

Spain - Madrid

Greece

Norway

Any suggestions and/or tips would be greatly appreciated!"
t3_1fvzqax,China in July - 15 days itinerary question,"Hello everyone!

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

Thanks in advance!"
t3_1fw509b,Morocco 9-day itinerary tips,"Hi everyone! Me and my partner are going to Morocco for a 9-day trip in November (including travel days), it's our first time there and I would like some tips! It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

  
And if you have any other tips about Morocco and traveling there, please let me know :) "

t3_1fw4gfp,Osaka to Bangkok via Shanghai Pudong (2hrs 2 mins layover) NEED ADVICE PLS!,"Hi all,

Osaka to Shanghai Pudong = Peach Aviation (arriving 24:20)

Shanghai Pudong to Bangkok = Thai Lion Air (departing 02:40)

Luggage: HAND CARRY ONLY!

Layover time: 2 hours 20 mins

- Since we don't have any check in luggage, is it possible to just go to the transfer desk and get a boarding pass there? (Note: Thai Lion Air doesn't allow online check in for international flights according to their website)

- If not, do we have to apply for a transit visa just so we can go through immigration and customs and then check in again at the Thai Lion Air counter?

- OR can we just go straight to immigration and customs and they will issue us a transit visa there considering we are not leaving the airport and only getting out of airside so we can check in again?

  
2 hours and 20 mins is not a lot of time so there's gonna be a lot of running.  My mistake in buying this type of ticket &gt;\_&lt;"

t3_1fv4vli,Just how many people have been scammed by edreams? ,"I recently found I was charged 60 euros by a travel company called edreams. I had never booked a flight with them, so I contacted them via email, and they were kind enough to answer that they would help me identify the transaction.

After one month of back and forth emails, they apologized and let me know that while they DID charge me for a subscription, **there was NO account under my name, email or telephone number.**

The story should have ended with a refund then and there, but they also let me know they would NOT be refunding the money. They were also unclear on how or where they got my credit card information.

This is where I started digging, and I found **they have been doing this for years!**

Any google search for edreams will immediately bring up hundreds of social media posts with the same fraudulent charge disguised as a ""subscription"".

At this point, out of personal interest, I'm interested in collecting names and testimonials from other people with that have unknowingly ""subscribed"" to an edreams membership.

* No budget concerns, price is not a factor
* Rome would be winter, so the weather might not be good? Unsure about this. Plus side is that it will be way less busy and its football season and I love football
* How friendly and open are people in these cities? I've heard Mexico City is great for meeting new people, idk if the same can be said of Rome and Dubai?

This is all through the hotels website, and we booked with 100% free cancellation, no deposit, so it’s not like we’re wanting to match a competitors price or get money back or something.

t3_1fw1sn2,Removing spouse’s name on passport mandatory?,"Indian citizen. Travelling to croatia in early 2025. My passport (renewed in 2019) mentions my spouse’s name. I have since (2023) gotten divorced. Does my passport need to be reissued to remove my spouse’s name? I am scheduled to travel early next year to EU and would need to apply for a Schengen tourist visa (no prior history of Schengen visa, though i do have an UK visa from 2019). 

Also, i am a male - no change in my name. Only marital status. 

I assume the schengen visa application form does ask for marital status, would the conflict between my passport and my form likely to get my application rejected?

Not sure if it matters, but travelling with a group of friends. 

I understand that mentioning the name of spouse is not universal. My query is more from the visa perspective. "
t3_1fwax5k,My experience traveling internationally with a drone for the first time.,"I recently (September 2024) traveled to Greece with my new DJI Mini 3 with a short layover in Istanbul, both on the way there and back. I flew on Turkish Airlines. This was not my first time traveling internationally, but it was the first time with that type of equipment and I was utterly stressed out about it. I purchased the drone specifically for said trip. I made the mistake of going down a Reddit rabbit hole and all it did was make me feel more uneasy about it to the extent that I was ready to leave the drone behind. I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone. I even went through the painstaking process of registering the drone in Greece and I felt even that was a complete waste of my time. Just thought I would share my experience. "
t3_1fvym2g,I have three weeks to fill between England and Berlin in Nov. What's off the beaten track? And what's essential?,"Title says it - I want to be in Northeast England in early Nov, and my flight home is from Berlin in late Nov. I want to take my time while also seeing as many cool things as I can before I fly back to the my side of the globe.

  
I've got some ideas of what I want to see: definitely spend time exploring London and Berlin, stop off somewhere in the Netherlands, look into stopping off in Scotland or France (but I bet it will be very cold and dark in Scotland!). I'm super interested in the history and the culture, so looking for museums and old architecture, and anything else that will be a fun memory.

  
So my big questions are:

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

t3_1fvaxy8,What is it with every business begging for Google or TripAdvisor review?,"I’m currently in Egypt (spoiler: I love it), and I was wondering why is it that every business asks for Google or TripAdvisor review? They also ask for the waiter/tour guide/contact person’s name to be mentioned in the review. I kinda can understand that tour agencies need it to boost their sales, but an established 5-star resort? It feels a bit off-putting. And this is not in Egypt only. Last year in Jordan, a dude literally waited over my partner’s head for a Google review in a 5-star hotel.

t3_1fvuswq,Suggestions for a place to spend summer 25' (Spain/Portugal),"Hey people. I (26M) work as a software engineer and plan to spend the summer of 2025 in some other country. I am from Eastern Europe and I want to be able to go home from time to time and have friends come visit easily, so I decided that I'll choose some place in Europe. I am currently thinking about Spain and Portugal, as I've been on holidays in both of them and I loved the atmosphere. I am looking for nice, warm weather, surfing spots, beautiful beaches, culture and nightlife. I am learning Spanish since a couple of months and I would love to be able to practice it to some extend, and for that reason Spain seems to be the better choice in terms of self development, but I know that Portugal tends to be cheaper, and I absolutely love Lisbon. I am also open to considering other countries, Italy, maybe Greece. What do you guys think?"
t3_1fvrfir,Urgent: Bulgarian airlines Lost Luggage Tag,"Hey!

I went on a work related trip to Sofia (Bulgaria) and I flew home to Lisbon (Portugal) two days ago. After arriving in Lisbon, I wasn’t able to find my bag and realized it had been lost.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

But our dilemma is that we only can afford about 10 days as it looks because we don't wanna be doing hostels and trains/plane fare is rather expensive as it looks for summers in Europe. Just wanted to come onto the subreddit to see if this would even be a possible trip with all of the places we genuinely want to explore. I'm willing to expand the trip up to two days to account for travel. If anyone has any advice regarding trains, planes, itinerary, or just the simple fact that our trip may not be possible, please leave it below! Thanks so much. 

Edit: Okay totally impossible haha. If I I decide to split 10 days into London &amp; Paris, is there anywhere else in France that I could stay &amp; still be able to travel to Paris from? I'm not really looking to stay IN Paris but rather a place a train ride away (personal preference, probably not logical but i don't care much haha). Also any other places in France close by that would be worth seeing if we have leftover time? Thanks for your advice guys!!! "

I am torn. First about me: (1) No business class (2) I sleep on flights. Not necessarily well but I can pass out for an entire 7 hour red eye flight. (3) I have been to Frankfurt before.

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

Some people say just get it over with and do one really long flight. Thoughts?

We lost my wife's father this year and have both been doing a lot of work on ourselves, our relationship, and finding peace. I don't even know where to begin, but I kind of have a picture in my mind. I'm intentionally leaving price and region vague as I'm curious what comes to mind when you read what I'm looking for, and we are flexible in these departments. We are not wealthy, but are dual-income, no kids, and never treat ourselves. Mid-30s.

Must haves: Quiet, beautiful, access to nature/hiking trails, either warm weather or moderate, hot springs or hot tubs outside, good food, everything we need on-site. We're looking for romance, privacy, healing. A day spent reading, strolling a trail, and having healthy food would be the perfect day.

Would also love: horses or other animals, no kids, yoga

Do not want/need: party vibes, stuffy, corporate, cell service, internet, TV, alcohol

let me introduce myself. hi, i am 25 and just graduated uni. after a long time dreaming, i decided to finally go on the trip of my dreams. we visited 8 countries and rode planes, buses, trains, ferries, we did it all. really it was an amazing trip, but i come back home feeling more empty than ever. my friends fought the whole time, my one friend had a meltdown in each country we visited about random stuff, i felt stressed and annoyed a lot of the time. 

we don’t live in the same province and now that i am back home (i still live my parents:( ) and away from my friends i just.. idk. i’m left to figure things out again, but im more broke than ever now. i just feel the crushing weight of having to pay my bills and catch up with everyone who stayed and continued their normal lives while i disconnected from everything and now still feel disconnected af. i also left my job to do this (i didn’t wanna work there for long anyway) so i also am jobless😭

i thought travel was supposed to be this eye opening experience?

t3_1fueq0d,Ten days in Brazil 🇧🇷 ,"Recently I had the chance to visit Brazil and wanted to share some of my picture and experiences.  I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

Thanks for being a great host Brazil, Obrigado!"

t3_1fv2ci5,2 month train loop of France,"Hi everyone, I am in the beginning stages of planning a 1-2 month trip around France next September entirely by rail. I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille. 

This is a lot, so thank you very much for reading it and any advice you have for me!"

t3_1fvj3pm,Renting a car in the US as a Canadian and I have some questions.,"I am flying to Vegas next week where I have a whole 12 day trip planned out with my girlfriend. My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out. 

- assuming my flights go without delay, I will arrive at the airport at 10:30pm and my car rental from fox is scheduled to be picked up at 11:30pm. I am worried I didn’t give myself enough time to deal with finding my checked bags and dealing with customs or whatever. Can I just call the place in advance if I’m running late?

- We are scheduled to stay at the Luxor hotel for the first 3 nights but we will only most likely be checking in at like midnight - 1am the first night. Is this worth calling them in advance?

t3_1fvnxm4,Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) Exemptions,"Hi all,

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

I have also emailed the various embassies and consulates but 1) it's Friday and 2) I'm flying out next week and not currently in the UK, so keen to get as much info as I can from as many sources 😅 

Many thanks in advance!!!

Although I see this in their local and Regional plans, the reason I ask this is more or less to do with NordVPN. I know Saily was created by NordVPN which you may of heard has had multiple reports this year saying it doesn't work anymore.

I've been recommended to get an eSIM in addition to a VPN for China.

I'm looking at going to go to multiple countries around Asia, China being one. So I have been looking at Asia/Regional plans with good amount of data for good pricing.

I'm looking for one that will allow me to use Whatsapp and/messenger to call family back home (and having both an eSIM and VPN were highly recommended). So I'm wondering if Saily has been working fine for people even if NordVPN isn't?

I'm from Aotearoa (New Zealand) so the idea of a global eSIM is a bit tricky to find at a good price.

I budgeted about 6K total for the trip, is what I have leftover enough to have good food/cool experiences with?

For reference, just booked my flights via Delta and Aer Lingus for about $2500 total round trip for both me and my S/O, coming from Chicago. Booked all of our lodging for about $800 total for 6 nights. We’re staying in East Lothian (East Liston for 2 nights &amp; Haddington 4 nights).

So far as getting around is concerned, we won’t have a car. I’m hoping to rely on both ride share and the trains for travel around the coast (North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady, Musselburgh, Dunbar, etc). Any suggestions on what is most cost effective? Is this a reliable way to get around relatively efficiently? Obviously we’ll plan to do a lot of walking around in each village/area, but getting to each area is my main focus here. Is Uber reliable in that area? Are the trains fairly inexpensive? 

Still looking for cool pubs, restaurants, sights, etc in each of the places I mentioned. Obviously we’ll stumble on some hidden gems just walking around, but any suggestions are much appreciated!

Just fyi, I’d like to exclude Edinburgh for the most part. But I’d love for someone to change my mind! I’ve heard there’s a lot of tourist traps around the city and with that comes more excessive spending which we’re trying to avoid. 

Again, any advice and comments are much appreciated.

Me and a group of friends are organising a trip to Poland in late November and are trying to decide between Krakow or Wroclaw.

The one bit of extra info I’m curious to hear about (besides all the basic stuff like which is better, is one cheaper than the other etc) is one of the group mentioned that Krakow is conservative and slightly homophobic, can anyone speak to this one way or the other?

My personal preference is to go to Krakow but curious to hear people’s thoughts.

My goal would be to kill some hours at the Mall of Asia in Manila and then return to the airport. The alternative is to fly in the evening before and spend the whole day in Manila before heading to the airport in the evening.

t3_1fvfh47,Vietnam Itinerary Suggestions ,"Hi all! Early next month (November), we will be traveling for two weeks in Vietnam. The trip has come up quite suddenly, so I haven't had a ton of time to do research yet. I would appreciate anyone's comments, additions, or suggestions regarding the interary I've put together.  At the moment, I only have a flight into the north and out of the south booked, but I need to submit an address for my evisa, so I'd like to have at least my first hotel sorted out soon. 

I've never been to Vietnam, so all I know about now are the main points which I read about online. The buses looked interesting, but considering the low cost of domestic flights, and the long distances, I think we will just plan to fly between the major cities. I am not sure if it is best to spend so long in HCMC, or if we should spread some of those days to a different city. We are interested in historical places/museums, shorter hikes, beaches, and good food. Also, any additional tips about day trips from the big cities would be awesome!
Thanks in advance!

2nd/3rd - Hanoi
4/5th - Ha Long bay
6th - fly to Da Nang
7th - explore Da Nang
8th - day trip to Hue
9th - day trip to Hoi an
10th - fly to HCMC
11th/15th - in and around HCMC
16 - fly out"

t3_1fv8yyh,Help my expand my Asia trip,"Hi, I am a single 36M from the UK and I have booked my first solo trip (hurray!) to Japan some weeks ago. Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

Also happily take alternative itineraries! Other countries I find interesting are Vietnam,  China and Indonesia. 

Many thanks! "

t3_1fvboxg,Late December trip suggestion ,"Hello everyone,

I’m planning my winter holidays and need some advices

contexte : I am a 30 French woman from Paris and I have some holidays from the 19th till the 1st of january 2025, I might extend them till the 13th as the 13th is my bday i want to be away for this. So its between the 19th till 13th January.  
i’ll travel solo and have a budget of \~2500. My non-négociable is : nothing COLD, for me winter holidays are to go as much as possible from the gloomy weather, a little break from the winter depression.  
i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

Sorry for the long post, I welcome all feedback/ suggestions. Any help welcome !

Thanks!"

t3_1fvauvm,4-Day Trip in Late October - Iceland or Tromsø Without a Car? Need Recommendations!,"Hey fellow travelers!

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

Any thoughts or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much!"

Is this a bad idea? Will it give ideas to opportunistic robbers? My main concern is if I make some mistakes while driving, the sticker would give drivers behind me a hint of caution.

Update: Got it. I think I will use “New Driver” or “Student Driver”. I got the idea for a tourist sticker from a recent practice in Hokkaido, Japan

https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160416/p2a/00m/0na/005000c

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting. Again, we are really wanting Colorado but I just worry about the altitude sickness. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! "

t3_1fvpzkk,Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

t3_1fv6h7f,VAT refund Barcelona Airport Experience ,"I’m traveling with my mother in barcelona. I’m flying home earlier than my mother while she continues her travels. She placed all of her purchases under my passport and I am planning to attempt a VAT refund by myself (I will not be taking all items purchased with me, they’re all smaller items and can also claim they are items I already have if they do ask) She said some airports are more relaxed and did not need to show all items when submitting for the refund. How has your experiences been in the past with the Barcelona airport? Did you really need to show all of the items? I’m just planning on checking the items that I’m bringing with me so will do this prior to security.

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
t3_1fur09r,Week-long Vacation - Prague or Madrid?,"I went to Scotland last year and had a great time in Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands. I wish that I could go back, but I'd like to try somewhere new in early November next month. I'm in the U.S. if that matters.
 
I am decent in speaking and understanding Spanish, so Madrid seems like a good option to try tapas and go to museums. Barcelona might be a secondary option as I want to encounter the Catalan language and culture.

At the same time, Prague seems like such a beautiful city, and I'd love to see Prague Castle. The food doesn't seem as good as in Spain, but good enough. I only have a week unfortunately. Thoughts? "
t3_1fva8x7,Best places to add to my first multi-stop travel,"Im 22 years old and have decided to travel to (so far) 6 countries back to back, with around 5 days spent in each country.

So far i’ve decided to kick it off with going to egypt first, then head to Thailand, then China, then Seoul and finishing it off in Japan.

Im very young obviously so money is scarce, i’ll have enough for the flights, and i’ve made the budget of $1000 for accommodation/food. I plan on staying in cheap hotels / hostels most of the time, with thailand being the only exception as it is so cheap there to book a decent airbnb.

Im very early into the planning, and i will most likely get this trip done in either January or February. With the months in consideration, i know i might have to remove/add some destinations i just havent thought of yet. Thats were this post comes in! I was hoping i’d get some great recommendations that would fit this backpacking trip.

im excluding mexico/brazil and every country in that region as i just dont feel experienced enough to navigate well through there.

My main goal is to experience rich culture but also see some beautiful landscapes (hence China and Egypt) 

Thanks in advance."
t3_1fvf2oc,Hotel Predicament ,"I have an odd predicament about booking a hotel. My friends and I have been saving up to get a hotel for next summer to go to a con, however as I was booking the hotel, I put down for 4 adults for 5 days, and went through with the purchase, it was a non refundable, pre-purchase for the room. As I looked at the receipt, it said “2 adults”… that’s odd, I know I put for 4. So I called the hotel, and explained the situation, and the guy was like “that’s fine” but he was so monotone and hung up almost immediately after… so what should I do? I don’t want to make two people stay behind or anything but I cannot get my money back. (If it’s not obvious, I’ve never booked a hotel before)"

t3_1fv2xqr,Has anyone from outside Germany ever processed a paper DB (Deutsche Bahn) compensation claim?,"So long story short DB owes me some €300 (cancelled trains and overnight stranding). It's been 2 months and all that has happened so far is this:

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point)."

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? "
t3_1fuq240,Planning a trip to Ireland / Scotland,"Hi, 
Planning a trip to Ireland / Scotland.  First time to either country but from the YouTube research, I'll probably be back to see more of the scenery lol.

I was planning to rent a car.  

So my questions are this - which country would you do first?  What are some drives or loops that you would recommend to see the scenery in either country?  Is there any self-led audiotours that someone can do for either country? (Ie like guide along tours or action tour guide apps)

Also, how would you recommend traveling between the 2 countries - from my research, it looks like plane or ferry (if I did ferry, it looks like you can catch a bus between belfast-galway which goes from city center to city center via the ferry)

I haven't done European travel since before CoVID but is there Uber/Lyft/(European equivalent) for taxi service?

t3_1fuyq94,Applying for Japanese eVisa on applied PGWP status.,"Earlier this year, my friends (permanent residents of Canada) and I (a recent university graduate with a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) application in process) planned a trip to Japan. We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

PS: We are residents of Whitehorse, Yukon and the closest Japanese Consulate Office we have is either Vancouver or Calgary.

t3_1fvcgne,Anyone else notice that Southwest leaves the seatbelt sign on for basically the whole flight? ,"In the past I’ve almost exclusively flown Southwest but lately for various reasons I’ve flown on several other carriers both within the US and internationally. I’ve noticed other airlines like American, United, BA, and Lufthansa all turn their seatbelt sign off before even reaching cruising altitude. This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence. Anyone else notice this?

Edit: for everyone replying “you should keep it on anyway when seated” I 100% agree with you and do that myself. I’m only talking about getting up to use the restroom, grab something from the overhead bin, etc. "

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen?

t3_1fun8lm,16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

Thank you for any advice you are able to give!"

t3_1fu7vaf,"Mainly for European travelers but, has anyone had an experience where they are asked for Identification by police or other institutions and could only provide a Drivers’ License?","
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;

Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened?

t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place"

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you."

We'd fly from Big Island to Denver and rent a car to get where we want to go. Any info or help is appreciated!"

t3_1funmzo,Should I self-drive on trip with family? Need suggestions.,"I'm a north indian and will be traveling to Kerela in December with family (5.5 members) on a 4 day trip. Parents (60 both), Younger brother (27), Wife and my 1 year old. I'll be the solo driver since none of them knows how to drive.

I have good experience driving my hatchback (over 70k kms), since we're already 6 and 5-6 bags of luggage I'll have to take a 7 seater SUV on rent. I'm not sure how comfortable I'll be driving it for the first time that too on a road trip. 

We're going from kochi to munnar, which is a hill station. No idea about how good and broad the roads are. 

Itinerary is Kochi &gt; Munnar &gt; Alleppey &gt; Kochi 

Total travel distance is only 360 kms, but map shows 9 hours as travel time.

Looking for answers from localities and folks who have covered these stops. TIA. "

t3_1funb65,Transit Visa for Canada,Hi I applied on August 14th for a transit visa because I have layover in Canada on my way to Japan. I haven’t heard anything since then. Should I be worried? My place of residence is FL. Should I reach out to the offices in New York or California? Do they each have designated area they cover or is it random which office processes it. My flight is October 27th. Please help! 
t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

"
t3_1fuxzox,September 2025 suggestions,"Couple in our 30s living in east coast US. Prioritize food and drink (wine, cocktails), warmer weather. Love a beach day, but also enjoy cultural sites and vibrant city life. Less interested in hiking, camping, clubbing, crowds, museums. 

Have approximately 10 days (including travel) and budget 5-7k (hoping to utilize reward points for airfare). 

Past destinations include Amalfi coast, Greek islands, Puerto Rico, Aruba, Cancun, Paris, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Hawaii, Maine.

Destinations we are considering: Turkey (safety concerns?), Spain (Mallorca vs Basque Country), Amsterdam, Croatia, Japan, somewhere else in Asia? (Not sure if worth the flight with only 10days)

Thanks for your suggestions! "
t3_1fumpct,"Transiting through UK(LHR), Istanbul ( SAW) and Kuwait.","Hi peeps,
I'm an Indian citizen with Canadian PR and US B1B2 visa. I'm planning to travel from Canada to India through the countries mentioned above to reduce the total ticket fare. 
I am planning to take a flight from Canada to London 1st. 
Web site of government of UK says, a person with Canadian PR can transit through UK without a visa and can spent upto 23.59 hrs in UK as long as they and depart by air and has confirmed onwards flight that leaves on the day one arrives or before midnight on the day after one arrives. In that case, am I allowed to pass through the boarder control and spent 20 hrs in London? 
Kindly let me know if I am allowed to transit through SAW and KWI airports without a transit visa. Layover at Istanbul is around 3hrs and Kuwait is around 18 hrs.
Appreciate your insights."
