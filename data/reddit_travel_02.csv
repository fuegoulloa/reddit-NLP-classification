t3_1fv4vli,Just how many people have been scammed by edreams? ,"I recently found I was charged 60 euros by a travel company called edreams. I had never booked a flight with them, so I contacted them via email, and they were kind enough to answer that they would help me identify the transaction.

After one month of back and forth emails, they apologized and let me know that while they DID charge me for a subscription, **there was NO account under my name, email or telephone number.**

The story should have ended with a refund then and there, but they also let me know they would NOT be refunding the money. They were also unclear on how or where they got my credit card information.

This is where I started digging, and I found **they have been doing this for years!**

Any google search for edreams will immediately bring up hundreds of social media posts with the same fraudulent charge disguised as a ""subscription"".

At this point, out of personal interest, I'm interested in collecting names and testimonials from other people with that have unknowingly ""subscribed"" to an edreams membership. 

I think there's a clear case for consumer fraud, and I'm sending this to a couple of European consumer agencies!"
t3_1fv4z6a,Required to carry significant amount of cash to Thailand,"I was told by my tour organizer that we are required to carry THB 20,000 per adult when visiting Thailand and is not just sufficient to show this as a bank statement.

t3_1fvgocr,First time in a hostel,I am heading out to London and Wales next week. I am staying in a hostel for the first time and am going to be alone in London. I am staying with friends in Wales.

And convince myself the hostel is going to be fine and I am not going to regret staying in one. 
t3_1fvaxy8,What is it with every business begging for Google or TripAdvisor review?,"I’m currently in Egypt (spoiler: I love it), and I was wondering why is it that every business asks for Google or TripAdvisor review? They also ask for the waiter/tour guide/contact person’s name to be mentioned in the review. I kinda can understand that tour agencies need it to boost their sales, but an established 5-star resort? It feels a bit off-putting. And this is not in Egypt only. Last year in Jordan, a dude literally waited over my partner’s head for a Google review in a 5-star hotel. 

Can anyone shed some light on this?"
t3_1fueq0d,Ten days in Brazil 🇧🇷 ,"Recently I had the chance to visit Brazil and wanted to share some of my picture and experiences.  I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

Thanks for being a great host Brazil, Obrigado!"
t3_1fvhpl2,International Driver's Permit for Vietnam,"I'm looking to rent motorbikes while in Vietnam. I have a valid U.S. driver's license for passenger vehicles - but I don't have a motorcycle license.

Do I need an IDP for motorcycles to rent one in Vietnam? If so, do I need a motorcycle license in the U.S. to get the IDP?

I've heard Vietnam only recognizes the 1968 IDP, how do I know if I'm applying for the right one?"
t3_1fv9dcs,14h&amp;2h or 7h&amp;10h flight combinations? Which would you prefer? ,"I am flying from the east coast of the United States to Windhoek Namibia. Which would you prefer or recommend?

8:55P NWR to JNB 6:36P local (14h) &gt;&gt; 16 hour layover &gt;&gt; 10:40A JNB to WDH 12:50P local (2h)

5:50P NWR to FRA 7:25A local (7.5h) &gt;&gt; 14 hour layover &gt;&gt; 10:00P FRA to WDH 9:15A local (10h)

I am torn. First about me: (1) No business class (2) I sleep on flights. Not necessarily well but I can pass out for an entire 7 hour red eye flight. (3) I have been to Frankfurt before.

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

Some people say just get it over with and do one really long flight. Thoughts?"
t3_1fvavhr,Where to take a train from Amsterdam?,"My wife and I are planning a two-week trip to Europe in early December. I've never been, and she's been to Catania and London.

I have a large bag I will be using for paragliding that I will not need on the second half of the trip to Egypt.

t3_1fv6tud,"Looking to take first ""nice"" trip with wife after recent family tragedy. In US, late October/early November. Looking for: quiet, peaceful, nature, hot springs and/or warm weather. I guess a resort? This is all new to us, as we usually do more budget trips, hiking, etc.","Edit: HUGE thank you for the very thoughtful responses. We're going to do a more local trip this year, and take all of this info and start looking at a big trip for next year. This has been super helpful!!



We lost my wife's father this year and have both been doing a lot of work on ourselves, our relationship, and finding peace. I don't even know where to begin, but I kind of have a picture in my mind. I'm intentionally leaving price and region vague as I'm curious what comes to mind when you read what I'm looking for, and we are flexible in these departments. We are not wealthy, but are dual-income, no kids, and never treat ourselves. Mid-30s.

Must haves: Quiet, beautiful, access to nature/hiking trails, either warm weather or moderate, hot springs or hot tubs outside, good food, everything we need on-site. We're looking for romance, privacy, healing. A day spent reading, strolling a trail, and having healthy food would be the perfect day.

Would also love: horses or other animals, no kids, yoga

Do not want/need: party vibes, stuffy, corporate, cell service, internet, TV, alcohol

You know that show *Intervention*, at the end when they send people to these rustic places out in the desert to put their brains back together after years of hard living? It might sound funny but that's what I keep thinking of!"
t3_1fv2ci5,2 month train loop of France,"Hi everyone, I am in the beginning stages of planning a 1-2 month trip around France next September entirely by rail. I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille. 

This is a lot, so thank you very much for reading it and any advice you have for me!"
t3_1fudlmf,Trip to Hongkong🇭🇰,"Hong Kong can be describe like state in state. Even tho It’s officialy part of China, this special administrative zone have their own parliament, currency, army and even visa policy. You can travel here visa free. Hong Kong was for a long time part of British empire and you can see british influence everywhere (architecture, food and even language). Unlike the most of China, people in Hong Kong are more fluent in english which can be really helpful when you can’t find specific location. I can only recommend you to visit. 

Places on the photos:
1. Nan Lian Garden
2. Central Hong Kong
3. Tian Tan Buddha 
4. Viewpoint from Victoria peak
5. Statue of Bruce Lee
6. View from Avenue of Stars

11. Chi Lin Nunnery"
t3_1fvi4bm,Should we visit Krakow or Wroclaw?,"Hi all,

Me and a group of friends are organising a trip to Poland in late November and are trying to decide between Krakow or Wroclaw.

The one bit of extra info I’m curious to hear about (besides all the basic stuff like which is better, is one cheaper than the other etc) is one of the group mentioned that Krakow is conservative and slightly homophobic, can anyone speak to this one way or the other?

My personal preference is to go to Krakow but curious to hear people’s thoughts.

Thanks "
t3_1fvejry,"International trip soon, needing luggage advice for Christmas gift","
Hey, looking to get my hubs luggage for an Xmas gift for an international trip i am planning. We have never bought rolling/360 spinner luggage before and I'm wondering for international flights would a checked roller or a carry on roller make more sense? Our gift $ limit makes it where i might not be able to find a 2 piece set... so im asking if you could ONLY choose ONE what makes the most sense? (We are not the type to overpack)

Also in my research I keep coming back to travelpro brand. is this a sturdy/good brand? Anyone swear by any another brand (moderately priced)?

t3_1fvhkll,Which Eastern European city to start with?,"So, we're planning a trip to Europe in next few months. We are a family from usa which has already visited Western Europe and now we want to visit the other side of Europe to see what it has to offer and also to save money. We're wondering which country would be perfect for our criteriums - has something to offer for family, great cuisine, interesting landmarks for reasonable prices. Guess all of them are cheap. We've already been to Greece, Italy and France and liked it all, but now we want to see something different.

Which country would be perfect for us? Which is like the best to start exploring Eastern Europe?

Edit: Mistake in post name, wanted to write a country, but also we want to visit a city in that country for sure :)"
t3_1fvcw14,Visiting Cotopaxi in Ecuador without the hike ,"I'll be visiting Ecuador for about a week coming up.  I'll be in Quito for a couple days and then descending down to the amazon for 5 days.  I then come back up to Quito and was looking at going to Cotopaxi for the day. 

  
My only concern is the hike up the side of the volcano will be very difficult because of the altitude and I will not have time to acclimatize in Quito beforehand.  

Has anyone done the Cotopaxi hike without acclimatizing beforehand?  

Are there any ways to visit the national park and base of Cotopaxi without doing the hike? "
t3_1fvbygf,From Laos to China with train?,"Hello everyone!
I'm traveling in Southeast Asia for a few months soon. I'm currently planning my approximate route and have seen that you could theoretically take the train from Laos to South China (Laos-China-Railway). 
Of course, I first checked what the conditions for a visa are and it seems to be relatively easy at the moment (visa-free entry). In other words, German nationals can enter China for tourism purposes for up to 15 days.
Unfortunately, I can hardly find any experiences or reports on the internet...

Have any of you had experience with the train and entering China with this visa and/or by train from Laos? 

I would be super grateful for any advice 🫶🏽"
t3_1fve0i2,"Best Value Short Beach Vacation location for a couple... Mexico, Colombia, Dominican Republic, or other?","I'm an American, looking to vacation somewhere warm. I'd be taking my gf (we are in our mid 30's)

Ideally, somewhere that the weather is warm, the beer is cold, and is relatively safe. I don't really want to travel around and sight see. I mostly want to wake-up, go to the beach and drink, then go somewhere to eat. 

I speak a bit of Spanish, so a Spanish speaking country would be ideal compared to say a Portuguese speaking country. 

I've been to both Mexico and the D.R. (Punta Cana) and enjoyed both.

Any advice/city recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Again, trying to minimize cost without sacrificing much safety/good weather.

My goal would be to kill some hours at the Mall of Asia in Manila and then return to the airport. The alternative is to fly in the evening before and spend the whole day in Manila before heading to the airport in the evening. 

I look forward to reading your input. Will I run the significant risk of missing my international flight in the evening when my domestic flight is delayed? Will Manila drive me crazy without a hotel room to relax? "

t3_1fvfh47,Vietnam Itinerary Suggestions ,"Hi all! Early next month (November), we will be traveling for two weeks in Vietnam. The trip has come up quite suddenly, so I haven't had a ton of time to do research yet. I would appreciate anyone's comments, additions, or suggestions regarding the interary I've put together.  At the moment, I only have a flight into the north and out of the south booked, but I need to submit an address for my evisa, so I'd like to have at least my first hotel sorted out soon. 

I've never been to Vietnam, so all I know about now are the main points which I read about online. The buses looked interesting, but considering the low cost of domestic flights, and the long distances, I think we will just plan to fly between the major cities. I am not sure if it is best to spend so long in HCMC, or if we should spread some of those days to a different city. We are interested in historical places/museums, shorter hikes, beaches, and good food. Also, any additional tips about day trips from the big cities would be awesome!
Thanks in advance!

2nd/3rd - Hanoi
4/5th - Ha Long bay
6th - fly to Da Nang
7th - explore Da Nang
8th - day trip to Hue
9th - day trip to Hoi an

t3_1fv8yyh,Help my expand my Asia trip,"Hi, I am a single 36M from the UK and I have booked my first solo trip (hurray!) to Japan some weeks ago. Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

Also happily take alternative itineraries! Other countries I find interesting are Vietnam,  China and Indonesia. 

Many thanks! "

Currently thinking the budget for food/shopping/activities will end up being an average of ~100£/day for the both of us. 

Was also thinking of applying for a no fx fee credit card and using that for day to day/shopping expenses. 

Not sure which option is better or if it really just comes down to preference. 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks for reading!"

t3_1fvboxg,Late December trip suggestion ,"Hello everyone,

I’m planning my winter holidays and need some advices

contexte : I am a 30 French woman from Paris and I have some holidays from the 19th till the 1st of january 2025, I might extend them till the 13th as the 13th is my bday i want to be away for this. So its between the 19th till 13th January.  
i’ll travel solo and have a budget of \~2500. My non-négociable is : nothing COLD, for me winter holidays are to go as much as possible from the gloomy weather, a little break from the winter depression.  
i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

Sorry for the long post, I welcome all feedback/ suggestions. Any help welcome !

Thanks!"

t3_1fvauvm,4-Day Trip in Late October - Iceland or Tromsø Without a Car? Need Recommendations!,"Hey fellow travelers!

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

Any thoughts or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much!"

2) Gwangju or Gyeongju, still haven’t decided yet

3) Busan

I moved out from my home in New Orleans to Phoenix for some work that is coming to a close around mid-November. Afterwards, I’m planning on driving home, BUT with a twist! This time, I wanna take a bit of an adventure around the West Coast since I’m not out here a lot, and because it’s apparently beautiful around here for the last few months of the year, so I figured I’d have a drive around here for a few weeks before I head on home!

For details, I’ll be driving all the time, so no flights, but budget also shouldn’t be much of a gap to worry about since I came out here for work anyway. I enjoy all types of stuff, from the outdoors to historical stuff and the more fun activity type places, and my top priority is to do some awesome experience, see some amazing things, and have a blast before I head back home!

t3_1fv6h7f,VAT refund Barcelona Airport Experience ,"I’m traveling with my mother in barcelona. I’m flying home earlier than my mother while she continues her travels. She placed all of her purchases under my passport and I am planning to attempt a VAT refund by myself (I will not be taking all items purchased with me, they’re all smaller items and can also claim they are items I already have if they do ask) She said some airports are more relaxed and did not need to show all items when submitting for the refund. How has your experiences been in the past with the Barcelona airport? Did you really need to show all of the items? I’m just planning on checking the items that I’m bringing with me so will do this prior to security. 

I’ve also read some threads that said there are locations in barcelona that stamp the receipts before the airport so you do not need to check the items there. Can you do this before your day of departure and how does that work? Would you suggest this instead?

t3_1fvdalx,Colorado trip?? Advice needed!,"THE TRIP IS SOON NEED ADVICE PLEASE- 

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting. Again, we are really wanting Colorado but I just worry about the altitude sickness. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! "

Im very young obviously so money is scarce, i’ll have enough for the flights, and i’ve made the budget of $1000 for accommodation/food. I plan on staying in cheap hotels / hostels most of the time, with thailand being the only exception as it is so cheap there to book a decent airbnb.

With the months in consideration, i know i might have to remove/add some destinations i just havent thought of yet. Thats were this post comes in!

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
t3_1fv2xqr,Has anyone from outside Germany ever processed a paper DB (Deutsche Bahn) compensation claim?,"So long story short DB owes me some €300 (cancelled trains and overnight stranding). It's been 2 months and all that has happened so far is this:

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point)."

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? "

Planning a trip to Ireland / Scotland.  First time to either country but from the YouTube research, I'll probably be back to see more of the scenery lol.

I was planning to rent a car.  

So my questions are this - which country would you do first?  What are some drives or loops that you would recommend to see the scenery in either country?  Is there any self-led audiotours that someone can do for either country? (Ie like guide along tours or action tour guide apps)

Also, how would you recommend traveling between the 2 countries - from my research, it looks like plane or ferry (if I did ferry, it looks like you can catch a bus between belfast-galway which goes from city center to city center via the ferry)

I haven't done European travel since before CoVID but is there Uber/Lyft/(European equivalent) for taxi service?

t3_1fv2tyc,EU and Schengen travel ban with travel thereafter ,"Hi there. 

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen? 

Exhausted google searches and relevant sites. Any information would be appreciated.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

PS: We are residents of Whitehorse, Yukon and the closest Japanese Consulate Office we have is either Vancouver or Calgary.

t3_1fvcgne,Anyone else notice that Southwest leaves the seatbelt sign on for basically the whole flight? ,"In the past I’ve almost exclusively flown Southwest but lately for various reasons I’ve flown on several other carriers both within the US and internationally. I’ve noticed other airlines like American, United, BA, and Lufthansa all turn their seatbelt sign off before even reaching cruising altitude. This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence. Anyone else notice this?

Edit: for everyone replying “you should keep it on anyway when seated” I 100% agree with you and do that myself. I’m only talking about getting up to use the restroom, grab something from the overhead bin, etc. "

t3_1fumo9j,Thoughts on this - starting your career early vs travelling the world whilst your young,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been pondering this question a lot lately and would love to get some diverse perspectives: Is it better to start your career early or to travel the world while you’re young?

I see the value in both sides and am struggling to decide which path to take. On one hand, I’m keen to establish my career and secure my future. On the other hand, I feel like I might miss out on incredible experiences and personal growth opportunities that come from traveling.

What are your thoughts? Have any of you chosen one path over the other? If so, how did it impact your life? Any advice or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot!

I have a ticket to Bangkok and must go through immigration; however, I am not staying. I am moving onward to Laos. I will be back in Bangkok a week later to go to other parts of Thailand, so I made my main airfare from the US to BKK roundtrip. My other ticket is separate.

I'm not sure which places Ill want to stay in more than others in order to keep my options open. I know you can book open flights but they always seem pretty pricey and I'm not experienced with booking flights last minute. Every other multi trip I've had was rigid. As I'm planning on travelling for 4 months I want to be as flexible as possible. EDIT: Thanks very much for the advice everyone, much appreciated! I think I'll book flights in advance in NA then when I get to Mexico/SA I'll do last min bookings between the countries.  "
t3_1fun8lm,16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

t3_1fuh6qq,Three weeks in Taiwan this November,"1. Is November a good time to go?  Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

Thank you for any advice you are able to give!"
t3_1fueo5c,"Travel Plan from Santa Maria CA, to Las Vegas, to the Grand Canyon","I have this travel plan set for February. I chose this month because in my occupation that's the slowest work month and leaving at that particular time wouldn't be a big burden on the company. And the state I live in gets extremely cold and depressing during that month, so I figured this would be an ideal time to escape. I have this travel plan set for an entire week (Monday through Sunday). 

My plan is to fly to Santa Maria, California. Get a hotel and a rental car. Stay there for about two days, and then drive on out to Las Vegas and stay there for about two or three days, and then end off the trip in Arizona at the Grand Canyon.

t3_1fu7vaf,"Mainly for European travelers but, has anyone had an experience where they are asked for Identification by police or other institutions and could only provide a Drivers’ License?","
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;
Paying for a parking ticket in Verona (through post office);
Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened? Were you fined? Jailed? Were you refused admission or services to something? How were you able to correct the issue?"

Do I go via Shanghai PVG with China Eastern, or via Beijing PEK with Air China? Same price pretty much. But not going via either of these options is more than £500 more.

Main thing I care about is not being delayed and stuck there, and getting my baggage. I'm especially nervous reading how long transit takes in China itself, and apparently delays are more common in Beijing. Has anyone had experiences flying with either on this route? I've searched the sub and found some experiences but not totally on these routes, they vary a lot, and are quite old. How long do I need for transfer? Also, I've heard long transfers of 10hrs or so cause problems with check in, has anyone encountered this?

Also, can you select seats easily? Flying is 6000x more tolerable with a window seat for me."
t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place"

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you."

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

I am relatively inexperienced in the world of Christmas markets, but looking at flights it seems doable.


Has anyone been to Prague Christmas market before? Is there any better timewise? Are the evenings/nights better than day time? 
Is that essential to the ambience/experience, in which case an overnight is needed?

Or is it doable and worth it if only for a day?

(Money and work will make an overnight hard but not completely impossible)



Any other markets that come highly recommended, for a day trip, or at a push a single overnight?

t3_1fv1pgt,British Airways’ lack of Class in Business,"It's always been a bewildering fact that British Airways and other European carriers just use the exact same seats for Business Class as in Economy. It's extremely uncomfortable, very tight leg room, no tv, no entertainment, no extra comforts, and on flights 3-4 hours long it's quite astonishing. They are getting away with a lot here, by charging so much more, basically for nothing, (except for maybe a sandwich or coffee in the lounge if you make it on time there). This needs to change so there's real options."

t3_1fujznz,Experience with TSA and garment bags ,I am attending my sons wedding and would like to carry on my gown in a garment bag.

t3_1fujtnq,Rabbie's Tours versus self-guided Highlands Roadtrip to see Scotland - experiences?,"My husband and I (both 30, from the US) are planning a late April/Early May trip to Scotland next year for about a week. We're debating on doing self-guided highlands roadtrip, renting a car and everything. I typically enjoy this type of planning but am mentally spent, and open to leaving it in the hands of experts. I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

Thanks!"
