t3_1fvgkl3,Seller's agent got mad at me for cutting off her lockbox but I'd asked her for 2 months to remove it. What is happening,"Am I really liable for the goddamned thing? We bought our home in San Antonio this summer. The agent had a lockbox hanging off the front door knob. I gave them a week after close and nothing. Then someone came and removed the yard sign but left the lock. So I called and left a vm to pick the lock up. Nothing. Waited another week. Then I removed it from the doorknob and left it by the water spigot out front. Another month passed. Finally I got sick of looking at it and tossed it in the garbage. Finally, two months after close, the agent comes to claim it. 

I told her I threw it out but gave them two months to come collect it. She snapped at me that they cost $200 and told me her broker would be in touch to buy them a new one. I stayed as polite as I could but I think she's unreasonable. AITA?"
t3_1fvx07l,Why are garages never shown in listings?,"Over the last 20 years, and aided by online sites, pictures of listings are much better.  Yet rarely do they include images of garages.  Floor plan renderings often exclude garages as well.

It seems too common to be accidental.  But why?"
t3_1fw8gjv,Builder locked in a mortgage rate without written consent. What can I do?,"I am constructing a new home and was offered a rate buy down as an incentive. I (and others who chose this incentive) were led to believe that this buy down would occur near closing. Obviously we hoped interest rates would keep dropping. I signed a contract to construct my home, but nothing was ever signed regarding the rate buy down. Everything was communicated verbally or via text, and now I realize, quite ambiguously. Our builder took a batch of contracts to the bank months ago and did not inform us that they locked in an interest rate or what it was. Now, months later, we are faced with a much higher rate than expected on our loan applications (their preferred lender), and would like to know what our options are. It does not even seem like an incentive at this point, and I would have chosen another had they explained it more clearly. Can they lock in a rate without informing us the date or what the rate is? Can we walk and use a different lender? etc."
t3_1fwdkbs,FL- seller admitted to lying on disclosure about home having aluminum wiring,"We got the disclosure for the house we were looking at and went under contract and moved ahead with the inspection. The inspection found aluminum wiring and the seller indicated “Don’t know” on the seller’s disclosure when it asked if the home had aluminum wiring. 

When our realtor brought it to her attention, the listing agent (the sellers mother) immediately replied in writing that she knew about the aluminum wiring from the time the seller purchased the home in 2016 but it was mitigated with alumicon. 

My question is about our recourse. The seller/listing agent (mother and daughter) have been stubborn throughout this entire process. We would like for them to extend the inspection period and pay for an electrician at their expense to confirm the wiring is successfully mitigated or to fix it. In the event that they refuse, we’d just like our inspection money back and to back out of the contract. 

If they refuse to fix the electrical issues or give us our inspection money back, do we have legal recourse to sue for damages since she admitted to lying on the disclosure? We put up $2,000 between the inspection and appraisal and took a day off of work to attend the inspection. Additionally, the agent acted unprofessionally during the inspection- she and her daughter, the seller, were both working from the home the whole time and their 4 large dogs were also there and unrestrained and jumping on us the entire 4 hours we were there. 

Just wondering if we have a case to sue should she try to be difficult about making the repairs or giving us our money back. Thanks! "
t3_1fw0xf5,Why haven't buyer's agreements changed with the rules changing?,"Not an agent, not a lawyer - just somebody that's never signed a buyer's agreement until I've seen a couple houses with a realtor (in a few states now over the last 10-15 years).

I understand not wasting an agent's time and also for a seller and their agent to know who is in their home, totally get it.

That said, how come nobody seems to have come up with some new type of buyer's agreement?

For example...write it up so that the buyer pays per showing and if they end up under contract on something with that buyer's agent the monies already paid get credited to the buyer out of the commission %?  This would cover the buyer's agent for their time REGARDLESS and let the buyer recoup those expenses if they're serious about buying."
t3_1fwai5f,Using Mr. Cooper for financing new house,"Mr. Cooper took over my mortgage and sends all kinds of offers. Today I saw that they are willing to drop their rate 1% for the year. I looked at the fine print and it seems pretty straightforward. Has anyone participate in this program? We are casually looking for another house so this piqued my interest.

&gt;Mr. Cooper’s Mortgage Markdown is a temporary buydown program that reduces the borrower’s effective interest rate and effective monthly payment for a one year period of time by establishing a custodial escrow account, which will be funded partially by the lender and partially by the borrower (in the case of a VA loan the account will be funded entirely by the lender), and funds will be dispersed from the escrow account to cover the difference in interest during the one year buydown period which subsidizes the monthly payment amount."
t3_1fwe80z,"I am buying my first home, however the seller is caught in the hurricane and is no longer responding….","We put in an offer to which they countered and we accepted. We already had the inspection on Tuesday, we got back to them on Tuesday night with our two requests for them to fix or potentially take off the overall cost for us to fix it ourselves. 
Now it’s Friday and we haven’t heard back from them, their realtor let my realtor know they’re in the hurricane in North Carolina. (I’m in Missouri and the home I’m buying is here too) I’m super concerned for them and I’m also wondering how this affects us buying the home, what happens if they’re not okay and don’t respond to us? Do we lose the house or do we get to go through with getting the house but ultimately without repairs? I don’t know how this would work going forward if it’s been days since any form of contact (last heard from on Monday). "
t3_1fvwvqq,Seeing a house unrepresented,"I tried to reach out to a listing agent to see a home (NE Ohio). I had already seen it during an open house, but wanted to give my parents a chance to see it since I am very interested in it. The listing agent told me that I had to decide who would represent me prior to seeing the home - i.e., if I would be unrepresented, have an agent, or have the listing agent dual represent

  
She implied that I would not be able to change this selection after seeing the home. I.e., I could not elect to be unrepresented, see the home, and then find an agent prior to making an offer. Is this true? How does this work legally? It does not make sense to me. 

  
Thank you in advance!"

t3_1fvmz0o,"Seller breached contract, now what?","I'll try to make this short and to the point, but there are a lot of moving parts.

We are supposed to close today on a property.  
The property has a home, a 2500+ sqft shop, and a very large pole barn (that has a lot of junk and debris inside).  
At one point the shop was used to commercially grow marijuana. It had a mini split AC unit, fully working fans, grow lights, hvac system, heating, water tanks etc.

In our contract, our ONE condition was that the shop be included as is, and all equipment stay, everything inside stay. We would allow the pole barn to be left as is (they wouldn't need to clean it out) so long as everything in the shop stayed.

Well today we went to do a final walkthrough and the shop had been ransacked. Mini split had been removed, grow lights gone, vents gone, everything was gutted and trashed. There's shit everywhere and they basically took everything valuable and left everything else in shambles thrown around.

We found out that the sellers agent told the seller that she could take whatever she wanted? (clearly didn't follow the contract)

We're kind of at a loss right now. The value of the shop is now significantly lower, we would have to do a considerable amount of work to restore it to working condition.  
Should we hire a lawyer?





Edited to add:
Exact wording from contract

PERSONAL PROPERTY: Only the following personal property, in ""AS-IS"" condition and at no stated value is included: (describe)
*ALL EQUIPMENT AND ITEMS IN SHOP SHALL REMAIN.”


Sellers agent admitted fault for telling the seller she could take whatever she wanted and was willing to give up his commission 


We do have an agent, just wanted to hear some other opinions because we are first time home buyers.

t3_1fwcktz,Changing agent during touring agreement period,"We just started our home search, and found a property on Zillow. We plan to talk to few realtors in our area for the home search, but found something on Zillow before that process. We requested a showing through Zillow. Since we didn’t have an agent yet, the Zillow assigned agent reached out to us and set up a showing. He informed me about the touring agreement that is valid for 7 days and is mandatory for him to show the house. We don’t know that agent before. So I am little hesitant to proceed with him if we like the house. After the showing, can we change the agent before the 7 day period (or even after) if we plan to put an offer for that house that he showed? If we can do so, will the new agent have problem with proceeding with the transaction? I understand it is not fruitful for the agent showing the property for us but at the time I don’t want to feel pressured or forced to go with him. "
t3_1fwckdd,Second home as first,"Hey all,

I have an opportunity to buy a house at a good price. It would be the first ever house that I would buy, but I wouldn't live there full time. It's kind of three seasons (although you could keep the heat on to make sure the pipes don't freeze). Because it's a second home, I can't take advantage of VA loans/first-time buyer loans and such, and I can't take advantage of some discounts that I might get to repair the septic. 

Wondering if I should just, claim it as my primary residence (which I might work towards) or if I should just claim it as a secondary? Any advice is greatly appreciated! "
t3_1fwcgnv,How to get started- where do I even begin?,"Hey. I'm not in a place in life to buy a home anytime soon, but I want to know what I need to do to get there and how to go about the process. 

I'm a 28 year old college dropout (want to go back and would have to start from zero) with a full time job paying $17/mo. I don't have any assets or family, I just got this job like 6 months ago when I was homeless. I now rent for $750 in NYC. Eventually I want to own a condo. Specifically a converted loft, as I've *always* wanted one similar to how some people think of their dream job or their weddings I guess? Anyway. I've never known a lot of people, grew up in a small poor family, and I don't even know how I would go about getting myself in a financial position where I'd be prepared to buy a home (I cant even afford the average apartment rent right now). 

Some tips, any guidance or advice would help. If this is a dumb, repetitive post, let ne know and I'll delete it. Thanks "

t3_1fwbrdf,How to increase property value without spending a ton,I recently purchased my dream home but the interest rates were terrible. I want to refinance now that the rates are lower but I also need to increase the value of the home by $75k or so to get rid of PMI and lower my payment even more. Any suggestions on what I can do? The house has the original kitchen (built in 1995) so I’m getting new appliances and switching from laminate to granite countertops. Also the deck looks terrible so I will be power washing and painting it. I doubt I have enough for a full bathroom reno but I’m thinking if at least updating the sinks to something more modern and putting in nicer lights and mirrors. Is there anything else I can do? Would that be enough to get the equity I need?
t3_1fwbf4a,"Buyer wants a $14,000 credit to remove young live oaks from the property before closing","We just finished inspection and the only issues were some causing work that needed to be done outside the house, hvac repair, a small leak under the bathroom sink, and some duct work in the attic that is being held down with wires. Our last inspection a couple of weeks ago never mentioned the hvac or the duct work problems. So the buyer requested $2000 credit for the hvac and duct work repairs. Then he wrote a whole paragraph asking to have $14,000 credit to remove trees from the yard. He said that he brought over an arborist who recommended that the trees be removed because they have the potential to cause future damage to the property. The trees were never mentioned in the inspection report. This is an AS IS contract. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this?"
t3_1fwb1rt,Real estate license application,I passed my california real estate exam at the end of October last year but have been putting off applying for my license since I am still in school currently and i realized I want to graduate before pursuing a career in real estate.

t3_1fw9h40,How do I answer this question on my Loan Assumption?,"I'm working on assuming the loan on my current home that I bought with my now ex husband. One of the questions under the Declarations: Property and Money subsection is asking about properties I own. Specifically if I had ownership interest in a property in the last 3 years. The home I'm assuming is my only property and it's established in other sections to be my primary residence and is obviously the property in question, in regards to the loan. I'm unsure if I should answer yes or no to having an interest in property in the past 3 years and if yes how to answer the second sub-question. My ex husband signed a quit claim deed over to me for his part of the property which has been recorded with the DNR so my name is the only name that shows as owner on the property so it seems like I can answer that I'm the only one that holds the title. I've attached a link to a picture of the specific questions.

t3_1fw9gya,[FL] Buyer wants to close as soon as possible and let sellers stay in until originally agreed upon closing date. Any drawbacks for the seller?,"Appraisal came back already so at this point it's just the waiting part. Original escrow timeframe was 30 days but the buyer is wanting to close up to 10 days earlier if possible. We said we can't do it (finishing up medical stuff and dates for work PTO and moving truck are already locked in). 

They came back asking if we could close early still but allow us free post occupancy through original closing date while funds are just held in escrow until then (or if we leave sooner). 

I'm looking for thoughts on pros and cons with this. I'm leaning on just leaving everything as originally agreed upon to keep complications to a minimum. I'm the main one dealing with everything and also the one wrapping up with a (minor) medical procedure so just feel like this is more mental effort than necessary before a cross country move."

t3_1fw7a76,"Bay Area appraised value significantly low, need help! Thanks","Hi, about six months ago, my business partner and I purchased a 12-unit commercial property (apartments) in the Oakland area for approximately $1.2M. Unfortunately, our business agreements aren't working out, and we never signed a TIC (Tenancy in Common) contract. Now, my partner is trying to buy me out.

We were in the process of refinancing, and the lender's independent appraisal valued the property at around $1.4M. However, I'm concerned about this figure. The property was originally purchased for approximately $1.9M in 2018, and it seems unusual for it to now be appraised at only $1.4M after six years, especially given that the surrounding area has appreciated in real estate value. There was no appraisal when we bought it, which complicates things further.

The appraiser justifies the $1.4M value by pointing to our recent purchase price of $1.2M, despite the fact that some repairs have been made and the property is cash flow positive. I’m worried that we might be miscalculating the property's value.

I’m confused about what my next steps should be:

1. Should I force the sale of the property, hoping it will sell for more than the appraised value?
2. Should I get a separate appraisal? However, if the second appraisal is also low, I might still be stuck with a buyout offer based on the $1.4M value. Plus, appraisals for large properties like this are expensive.

I’m feeling really unsure and anxious about the situation and would greatly appreciate any advice on what to do next.

Thank you so much for helping out!"

t3_1fw62i1,Old Mortgage Satisfaction (original) with Printed Notary Stamp?,"I purchased a property recently

There was a old mortgage on the property. It was paid off but never recorded as satisfied.

I had to work with an attorney to get the (now defunct) mortgage company to send the original mortgage satisfaction. (technically it was sent by the loan servicer)

It arrived today. It's clearly the original. It has the signatures of witnesses, parties, and the notary.

The only issue I noticed is that the notary stamp appeared to be *printed* on the document and not stamped. It's hard to notice, but I did notice.

This is an older document (2005).

Given I need to record this mortgage satisfaction, is it going to present an issue that the notary stamp was printed on?

The mortgage needs to be recorded with the state of South Carolina.

Any input is appreciated thank you!"

I've found a few houses, one in particular that caught my eye. 1300sqft with a single car garage, a nice front yard and fenced in backyard. It's a brick house. My area was hit by Hurricane Helene, so lots of rain happened over the past weekend. One thing I noticed on my tour today was what appears to be water damage coming from the roof, down to the kitchen ceiling and walls. I saw slight paint peeling, slight yellowing on the popcorn ceilings as well as a crumpled up tarp on the roof where I can assume the water was getting in.  The kitchen windows were also open I'm assuming to air it out.The roof also looked like it was overdue for a replacement. 

Should I even mess with this house? It's listed at 209k, but I'm trying to figure out how I can talk them down due to the damages, or see if they can file an insurance claim to have the roof and water damages taken care of.

There's a house I'm looking at for $65,000 in Lynchburg, VA and the bones look good overall but it doesn't have a kitchen. I've learned that credit unions and local banks would be the best bet to get a mortgage under $100k, but now I'm learning that most banks won't lend on a home without a kitchen. Do you think that a credit union would do the same? I don't want to do an FHA loan because I've wood worked before and want to build the cabinetry myself, plus my brother is a contractor so he could answer any questions I had along the way in doing cosmetic renovations around the house. We want to be able to move in and slowly renovate the home ourselves over time, so the FHA route doesn't really work for that since you have to hire a contractor (my brother doesn't live in state so it wouldn't be possible for him to help in that way). I estimated I have enough room in a line of credit I already have to purchase the basics I would need to build something like the kitchen cabinets and countertop so I wouldn't need to take out another loan for those items. 

So if I wanted to do something like that, is there a specific route I could take? 

Also, does anyone know if we'd be able to legally live in the home before the kitchen is finished? From what I've read it's probably a no, but I thought I'd ask because we'd be relocating to town so we'd have to get an Air BnB or hotel until we finished the kitchen then, which seems like wasted money if we already own a home technically. And we'd be fine with using a hot plate or slow cooker until the kitchen was ready. But I'm guessing that's a no. "

Anyway, me and my partner recently mortgaged a 2 bedroom apartment about 6 months ago in the UK. Since then we have had two fire door inspections, the first one was fine they had no issues and it was rather sudden since we had quite literally just moved in. But the second one has just happened and we received an email saying that the door doesn’t meet fire safety protocol? We haven’t touched the door other than opening and closing it and they have now quoted us £450 to fix it to meet the standards. 

I feel as if they’re taking advantage of us. We have already had to spend £3,000 on a new boiler since the one in the apartment was already knackered after a few weeks living here. So this added charge out of nowhere is just random.

t3_1fw3tmi,Please help! Not sure what to do!,"Sorry in advance for the long post! 

The back story:

In the end of 2022 my husband and I were house hunting with a realtor. We got under contract and our lender pulled out and ended up being a shiesty individual who was not doing things legally. Because my husband was self employed we struggled to get approval from another lender. We ended up accepting that it wasn't the right time to by and held off. My sister became a real estate agent in the beginning of 2024. After becoming an agent she connected with the agent we worked with before and was signed up to have her as a mentor and signed on with their brokerage. Over the following months my sister expressed second thoughts about real estate and not exactly liking the mentorship, but didn't express much about it to me other than that. She had begun applying for jobs outside of real estate and I wasn't really sure if she was even still working with the brokerage or communicating with them. 

The situation:

We were looking for some guidance on if we might be eligible to buy now and were told the best thing to do was apply for pre approval and that if you weren't approved they could tell us what to work on to get approval. We applied with an online lender that we had applied with during 2022. It is a well known online lender. This lender still had part of our application info on file including our agent info and we simply updated our info. What I didn't know what that they would automatically forward any denial or pre approval to the agent listed. Last time we applied the guy sent us the approval letter via email to forward to our agent. As a surprise to us we were pre approved and that online lender sent the pre approval to the agent immediately. She reached out right away and was like ""Oh are we ready to buy??"" I was put on the spot because I didn't know she would be told like that so quickly. I felt bad because she had shown us multiple properties and even got us under contract last time so I went with it and said yes. Since she was my sisters mentor we talked about her having my sister help with showings and other things on the deal and that my sister would be compensated. I wasn't sure how the mentorship worked and if they had some type of agreement to split commissions on things like this. I assumed this would mean my sister would be paid in some way if we purchased. The agent did ask me if ""my sister was still in real estate because she hadn't heard from her in a while"" and I thought my sister must not be working with her anymore - she tends to ghost people instead of addressing things head on.  I told my sister right away and assumed she would reach out to the agent and discuss how the financials of that would work especially since I told her the agent said she hadn't heard back from her. My sister did not reach out. The agent did not reach out to my sister. The agent started showing us properties and my sister didn't really say much to me or act excited to be involved. Along the way of seeing properties and working with the realtor, she seemed different this time. Less friendly, less willing to pull comps or try and negotiate deals on overpriced homes that had been sitting for a while. It felt like we were bothering her every time we were asking to see a home. It seems as if she just wants us to settle and buy something right away. This is our first home purchase and I want to make sure I've done all my research and make a smart financial decision. We are spending $400-500k so it's a big purchase. The agent will ask me if I want to put in an offer on a home we saw and if so how much and I'm having to ask her to do things like pull comps so I can make an informed decision. My husband and I haven't been happy with the service or the vibes the realtor is giving off this time around. My sister reached out to us last night and said she felt it was a betrayal and stab in the back that we didn't sign her as our agent and said that since our current agent was her mentor that she would've been involved and received some of the commissions and that it would've greatly helped my sister get established and make some kind of income. She said that we should've come to her before the realtor and that of course as my sister she should've been our agent. I tried explaining that the pre approval sent so quickly and that we were put under the spot and felt guilty with the previous agent and tried to ensure my sister would be compensated and involved in some way. My sister didn't want to hear it and didn't care and continued to go off about how f\*cked up it was and that it shouldn't have been handled that way. We aren't happy with our current realtor, but we signed an exclusivity contract. We are in a weird spot. If my sister would've come to me in a calm way and explained she was hurt early in this process we could've avoided signing this contract and made her our agent. The fact that she didn't reach out to her mentor right away and say ""hey my sister said she was approved and wants me involved in her home search, how are we handling commission"" didn't help. The agent also didn't reach out to my sister and say ""hey your sister is pre approved and signing on with us do you want to take on most of the work and split a percentage of this commission"". I'm at a loss as to what is the right thing to do here. We aren't in a rush to buy, but want to get under contract before the end of the year and close before March of next year. 

Please share your advice or what you would do in this scenario. AGAIN sorry for this long rant, I just felt the details were important. "

t3_1fvt9x9,Buy the big house or wait?,"Ever since having our second child, our current starter home has been feeling too small. We've been looking for a bigger place for 9 months, but the market is such that there comes maybe one potential house per month available in the areas where we are looking.

We finally found a house that ticks every single box. We can afford it. The only problem? It's too big. It's so big it would be more suited to a family with 4 kids (we only have 2 and are not having more) or perhaps two families.

We're at a loss for what to do. Do we just buy the house, and if it feels too big maybe we can rent out part of it? However while we have small kids I feel this is not ideal as our tenants would have to put up with the noise. And we'd have to spend more money to convert the place... And always share our space with others... 

Or do we just wait and hope that something else will eventually turn up...? 

Anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice?



Edit to add relevant information: 

We are not in the states. There is no such thing as central heating or cooling here, so utilities would not be astronomical. Hiring help for cleaning and home / garden maintenance is affordable. All of this would make owning a slightly bigger home more feasible. 

But... This house is truly massive. I initially did not add the size because most people wouldn't be able to comprehend having this much space. Everything is big here, it's the norm. I'd say the average houses in the neighbourhood are around 4500 sq ft. This one is 5500 sq ft (includes a triple garage). Maybe this information would sway those saying to go for it in the other direction!"

t3_1fvvw3v,How to compromise with our seller?,"\[UK\]

Our house purchase has ground to a halt.

The vendor tried to rush us into a quick exchange after a storm blew down their fence line. We only discovered this as we insisted on a viewing/inspection before exchange, it goes without saying that after seeing it, we refused to exchange until it was resolved.

The vendor has since insisted that the neighbour is responsible for the (shared) fence and assures us the neighbour has agreed to this, and so it was neither their problem nor their responsibilty to inform us. This is not supported by the transfer deeds, which apportion equal obligation, so it would seem this is just an informal arrangement.

We have never met the neighbour and do not feel comfortable taking it on trust that he will fix it, so in order to keep the sale moving and proceed to exchange, we suggested retaining funds with our solicitor until the repair is carried out, and then return the funds to the vendor. If it is not, for any reason, we would use the funds to carrry out the work ourselves.

Oddly, the vendor has completely lost their rag at this suggestion (which we believed to be quite reasonable) and refuses to engage with us on the issue from any other position that it is not his problem and shouldnt have to agree to those terms. The estate agent is quite transparently supportive of our point of view, but also has no luck in communicating reasonably with the vendor.

Although we have found the vendor to be churlish, rude and difficult every step of the way, we are only interested in getting this across the line and want to appeal to their better nature, so are there any suggestions for how we could frame the conversation to get a more positive outcome?"
t3_1fw5xez,Needing estimates on this $1.25M House Now(whether to buy) or Keep Saving for 2 More Years?,"

I'm looking to get an estimate of how much I would be paying monthly for this property. 

A little background of myself: I own my own business, and if I stay on track, I expect to gross $400K this year. After expenses, I’ll net $239K, and after paying myself, I'll have $142K left to put into savings. By the end of this year, I’ll have about $357K in savings. By the end of 2025, I expect to gross around $600K, netting $369K before my salary, leaving me with $273K to add to my savings, which should total around $630K.**360 Huntsville Idetown Rd, Dallas, PA**

**Situation:**

My wife, our two children, and I are currently looking for a house. We’ve found one that’s been on the market for over a year without any buyers. I feel the interior needs quite a bit of updating. We're considering purchasing it for $1.15 million. I’d appreciate help estimating how much I would likely be paying monthly if I put 20% down (and I’m also open to your thoughts on whether 20% is the best option).

  
Property:

* **Link:** [360 Huntsville Idetown Rd, Dallas, PA](https://www.lewith-freeman.com/real-estate/luzerne-county-mls/residential/property/24-2753-360-huntsville-idetown-road-dallas-pa-18612/)
* **Total Sq. Ft:** 8,106 (5,123 finished above ground, 2,983 finished basement)
* **Lot Size:** 5.23 acres
* **Bedrooms:** 4
* **Bathrooms:** 7 (3 full, 2 half, 2 three-quarter)
* **Taxes:** Estimated $26,223/year
* **Garage:** 4 stalls, attached
* **Year Built:** 2000
* **Utilities:** Central AC, gas heat, community well, on-site sewer
* **Features:** Modern kitchen, finished basement, lake view, security system, master bedroom on 1st floor, wet bar, deck, whirlpool tub, invisible fencing

My guesstimates:

* **Mortgage (Principal &amp; Interest):** $5,800 - $6,000
* **Property Taxes:** $960 - $1,440
* **Homeowners Insurance:** $200 - $300
* **Maintenance/Repairs:** $950
* **Utilities:** $380 - $710

 **Total Monthly Costs:** **$8,290 to $9,400**

Probably have to put in $200k for updating at least?

What are your thoughts? Is this property a worthwhile investment, or should I continue saving for another two years and wait for something better to come on the market?"

t3_1fvqrdm,[CA] Purchasing a home by Sheriffs Sale ( judicial foreclosure),"I am a tenant in a home scheduled to be sold by auction in California. It is a judicial foreclosure from a court case brought by a junior lien holder for a debt. The primary lien (mortgage) will get paid first, but are otherwise not involved.  

There are different provisions in a judicial foreclosure, such as a minimum value for auction, and a homeowner’s right of redemption period after the sale (3 months or 1 year in most circumstances.) 

If someone is interested in bidding at the auction, can they find out anything about the redemption period, or if other liens behind this one will survive the levy? 

Seems risky as a buyer to pay cash and not know if you have to wait a year to apply for title. That’s why I’m wondering how a buyer would research that information I so I can do the same thing. I have all the court filings and information about the liens, but they do not address this. 

Anyone with experience in this realm who can offer advice would be so appreciated.

t3_1fvorhl,FTHB Lender wants structural inspection ,"In need of advice! My husband and I are fthb. We're currently in the underwriting process and projected to close in 3 weeks. We have a conventional loan and are putting 20% down on this house for $245k.
It has an addition to the original structure that consists of a 2 car garage (lengthwise) on the basement level with a sunroom above on the main level that is half the length of the garage below. There's obvious issues in the garage portion that were evident during the first walk through. Vertical and horizontal cracks with inward bowing on one side due to improper drainage and a thick concrete slab patio above pushing everything down. Another issue...for some reason the lower portion of the garage that is not under the sunroom was built on a separately poured slab and is not plumb with the portion under the sunroom. This came up in our inspection of course. We were already keen on just knocking down the exposed portion of garage and fixing whatever was necessary in the portion under the sunroom and our inspector agreed with that as well as the removal of that slab patio. He added that better drainage and a retaining wall on the oppside side would be necessary. We were fine with tackling it, but assumed it would be after closing. It was appraised 2 days ago and now my lender (Rocket) is saying I need a structural inspection with any repairs noted and fixed before closing. My agent and inspector were somewhat surprised. I asked them ""so even if I want to knock it down and the inspector agrees with that and notes that, I'll have to have all that done before closing?"". My agent basically said that's really shitty but it sounds like it. For context, the sellers are an old couple who were in a rush to leave when we first saw it and actually moved out a couple days ago, probably right before the appraiser showed up. They were really unwilling to budge on the price. Asking $249,750. After a back and forth they said their bottom dollar was 242k. We went in with 245k because there was another interested party putting an offer in. They were also pretty dead set on not paying any of our closing costs. It's also an ""as is"" deal. I get the vibe they don't even have the funds to adresses the issues if we even asked. 
Interesting side note. Another person put an offer in about a month before us and startedgoing through the process, but backed out after their inspection because they weren't interested in dealing with the issues. The old couple apparently fixed up to move out then too and had to come back when the whole thing fell through. At this point I assume they're just unwilling to budge on price and are just waiting for someone to come along who has a lazy appraiser who doesn't bother to look too closely. Other than this issue, it checks almost all our boxes. Should we back out? I have a large inheritance 400k+, but it is hard to access because everything has to be done through my aunt who is the trustee, and lives 4 hours away. I got some money out of an inherited IRA, but it was like pulling teeth to get the whole transaction done. (Rocket is still asking for additional documents regarding that) What are our options at this point? I assume the structural inspector is going to note all these issues and rocket is going to demand it be fixed or won't let us close. Any suggestions are helpful and appreciated. Thank you. "

t3_1fvn2fg,FHA Loan - Broken window in shed. Need solutions for appraisal.,"Hey! Hoping for some quick advice and solutions.

In 2 to 3 days I’ll be having an appraisal and I just was reminded a window in the shed is broken. Not cracked, but broken from what I recall.

We thought originally being a non living space it for sure shouldn’t be a big deal. But I just found where it seems FHA doesn’t care about this use of the structure, broken window, needs to be fixed unless just cracked. 

Aside from replacing the entire window and frame for an updated window or just the window pane, what else is acceptable?

What if I literally take the window pane that’s broken out and don’t replace it? I assume I of course need to board it up inside and/or outside. What about if I just board it up inside and/or out and don’t take out the broken pane of glass?

Need to try and find a quick solution as fixing the window isn’t an option til Monday it sounds like. I don’t know I even care about replacing the window. I need to go and see it myself to recall as I don’t have enough pictures of the structure and from what I see no windows are broken, but I can’t see much clearly in the low quality photos used.

Edit: I went this morning and checked it out. There are some windows broken that someone tapped over pretty well, which I know isn’t part of any FHA guidelines I found, but just simply saying. There don’t appear to be any real dangers from these broken panes. 2 appear broken and 2 appear to just be something small went through at a high velocity and so there’s just a small hole and cracked around it. 2 windows are completely missing and 1 whole window is covered and another 2 panes missing in a window of line 8 panes of glass are covered."

Background: My parents are elderly and not well, they have a lot of medical issues and one of them is developing dementia. I have been their caretaker for decades and live with them. I've helped with the house payment (made most of it actually, except for taxes and insurance) which I was happy to do because I can't qualify for much of a mortgage (student loans, I have to work from home to care for my parents and that affected how much I can earn/pay). Their last house ruined our credit (overextended repairing things the inspector missed) and while we were preparing to claim bankruptcy on those credit cards a hurricane destroyed our house with a tree. It was insured and we were able to sell the remains/lot. We have to buy a new house in the next 6 months and we now have funds for a significant down payment. We're trying to keep the mortgage amount below 25% of the price of the house. They are not currently on Medicaid but there is always the possibility something catastrophic could happen any day and they don't want medicaid to make me homeless, but I don't want them to refuse care because their worried about the house. I do have a sibling but they are not close with my parents and the house is my parent's only significant asset so they are only in the will for things like pictures we saved. Would it be better to have a joint mortgage with the 3 of us on it, or would it be better to have it in their names and have some sort of trust set up? My parents are trying to make the transition as smooth as possible because I have an autistic child and they want to know we will be ok when they are gone, but they're used to handling things themselves rather than asking for advice and that's come back to bite us all more than once."
t3_1fvowrd,Group Investment Property Purchase?,"

I am wondering the best way to purchase a property as an investment between 3-4 people who will be sharing the costs of rehabbing the 4 unit apartment building. I'm in California if that matters. 

I have an idea in mind that we will each produce what we can in funding and get a hard money loan - fix up the property enough to then qualify for a conventional mortgage with an FHA owner-occupied loan that's low interest/down payment (by moving in myself for at least 3 years), then rent out the other units at profitable market rates and hold the asset for a few years or sell at a big profit down the road. 

What's the best way to set this up? Should we form a trust or LLC with the 3-4 members and terms of repayment of investment plus interest once profitable? Who would I even talk to about this?

They countered with 360k with only up to 2500 back after inspection and for us to fix all CO violations to gain occupancy. We countered back with the same offer stating why (total bathroom gut and potential floor joist replacement as from the powder room from below that bathroom showed water damage. So we moved the ceiling tile and found rotted floor joists from water damage), the basement floods because the windows arent fitted properly, the floor is uneven due to settling and there is a condemned pool on the property which they aren’t sure who’s land it’s on because his other uncle who passed too who lived next door.

They told him that he could choose to stay and follow the lease, or they can litigate and enforce the lease terms, and that if he chose to abandon the mobile home then ""Thats his prerogative""

t3_1fvles1,Is the real estate market today harder to break into than it was 10 years ago?,"I’ve been saving for a while and managed to pull together a decent budget recently. I’m thinking about getting into real estate, but everything I’ve been hearing lately is making me second-guess the timing. Everyone seems to say the market is way more difficult now than it was 10 years ago—higher prices, tougher competition, and more regulations to deal with.

Back then, it seemed like real estate was a solid investment with relatively predictable returns. Now, people are warning me about razor-thin margins and how hard it is to even break even, let alone turn a profit. I was hoping to get into property flipping or maybe rental investments with a $30,000 win I had on Stake, but now I’m not so sure.

For those of you who’ve been in real estate for a while, how do things compare today to a decade ago? Is it really as tough as everyone says, or are there still good opportunities if you know where to look? I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether now’s the right time to jump in, or if it’s better to wait for the market to cool off a bit.

Appreciate any advice from those with experience in the field!"
t3_1fvlcfa,What will the Spring bring?,"I must be a masochist because I keep posting in this group and getting roasted. But here we go. So I've seen and received the advice to delist and re-list in the Spring if a listing just isn't moving. Obviously no one here has a crystal ball, and we can only speculate. BUT, for those of you that have seen a lot of real estate market swings, what is more probable for the Spring? Houses could sell for over 10% more than today? Or less than 5%? Or not likely much difference? I just want to make an informed decision that I'm not beating myself up over in several years. "
t3_1fvl9gf,Commission Problem,"Context: I am in the process of getting my RE license in my state. Yet to take the exam, halfway finished with the course. My partner is a licensed agent, and I independently conducted market research, gathered insights, and created an information packet for my partner to send to an investor, subsequently leading them to submit an offer on the property. My partner and I have agreed to a 50/50 split on the commission, however, being unlicensed poses some legal concerns. 

What are our options to ensure I am compensated without violating laws and being investigated for unlicensed RE activity?

I did not engage in any sales activities, nor did I communicate with any parties on either buyer or seller side. I simply conducted and compiled market research for the licensed agent to close a sale on his own. 

There is a 90 day closing period, is it possible to get licensed and a referral fee in that period without raising any concern by my state's RE commission? Or charge my partner a consulting fee? Speak with an attorney?

Any insights would help. Thank you

t3_1fvg76d,Temporarily Off-Market StreetEasy ,"Hey guys I live in NYC. Was browsing apartments on StreetEasy and contacted the agency. Scheduled a tour. Yesterday I went to view the apartment, which I really liked. I spoke to the broker and said that I’m willing to proceed so she sent out an application to me. Filled out that application now waiting for approval however, when I got back on StreetEasy a few hours later, I noticed that this apartment is “temporarily off market”. What would this exactly mean? They received too many applications? Application approval, pending? A little bit confused here. Appreciate any input."

t3_1fvr7z9,Flip house immediately or rehab and rent?,"This week I bought a 2 bedroom house for $35,000 cash in a now or never private sale. I estimate the house is worth at least 50,000, maybe 60,000,  in the current condition.  It isn't a very deep hole as it needs around 10,000 in work to turn into a rental.  I own the house across the street. That 2 bedroom is worth around $125,000 now and rents for $1100.  (paid $28,000 + 25,000 in rehab).   I figure this house will be about the same rent but rehabbed just enough to rent will be worth 100k.   I can't work on it for about 5 months until I finish another house project in progress.  Insurance and taxes are about $1,100 combined for the year.  Comps on the occupied cookie cutter houses on the block are all over 100k.  

It is in a lower end neighborhood but everything that can be rehabbed for blocks around is being bought up by rehab and flip guys.  The area is coming up a bit but I would not say gentrified.

The worst house on the block just sold. It had no metal left in it. boarded up, 40 foot long retaining wall falling in, fire upstairs, lots of issues.  A contractor bought it for the unbelievable price of $60,000 and gutted it.   I was talking with him and mentioned I just closed on the house up the street.  He glanced at it and said ""I will give you 50k right now"".   This is a serious offer.

I am tempted to take the quick money for no work.  Especially so if I can get more than 50.   Of course taxes takes a chunk.

To complicate things, my wife does not know I bought it.  She told me not to buy any more houses because I have just been forced into early retirement.  I lied about the size of the severance settlement and bought the house.  I figure I just converted money into another form of money and I think it is worth more this way anyway.  Right now, most of my income is from rentals.  I don't really care how much they are worth because I am thinking only about monthly income.  So, for example, 45k into that house generates another 1100 in monthly income and it does not matter to me that the 45k is in a less than liquid asset that might be worth twice that.  Assuming I am around, I plan to rent my houses for at least another 10 to 15 years before I sell them all to cash out. 

I also am a flipper of goods bought from estates.  A $15,000 profit would be considered a major win for me in that business but not so much for my real estate side. 

Fix it and rent it or sell now for a quick profit?

t3_1fvyg50,I'm rethinking purchasing a home because of global warming.,"I paid cash for my last house. I recently sold it and am now doing a month-to-month rental, looking for a new house. After watching Hurricane Helene I am rethinking whether I should purchase, and if I do, if I should pay cash again or take out a loan with 20% down.

My thinking is that insurance companies will fold from these huge disasters, or our homes won't be insurable because of X reason. Then if something like Helene comes along you lose everything if you owned it outright. If you only invested 20% and have the rest in an index fund (like VTSAX) then you only lose the 20% you invested. If disaster doesn't strike you still gain equity (hopefully) and the benefit of owning your own house, which I love.

I am in the Eugene area which is west of most of the fire hazard area in Oregon but still seems iffy. I have family in Paradise, California and all eight of them had their houses torched over the last several years. They were insured, but how much longer will these homes be insurable?

I don't know. The cat woke me up because she wanted attention and I couldn't stop thinking about this."

t3_1fuspjo,"Buyer agent didn't get back to me in time, and house I was interested in went into pending","Just curious if anyone has been in this situation, and how'd you handled it. I reached out to my agent over the weekend, letting them know there were a few houses I wanted to take a look at.

Agent replied saying they're out of town for the weekend, but will get back to me during the week. Agent hasn't gotten back, and one of the houses is now in pending - the one I liked most. It was only listed for four days (Sat-Today). I was told they'd be free after Monday, since they were doing a staging for another client (I noticed this listing they were going to stage is now off market, not sure if that means anything.).

I trusted they'd get back to me yesterday, and was planning on following up today, but unfortunately the house went into pending today. There was no open house.

t3_1fviap6,Should I get an MBA? Any advice is appreciated. ,"To give you a little bit of my background, I am a 22 year old recent college graduate with a bachelors degree in finance, specializing in real estate. I'm from the Midwest, but I was very blessed with an opportunity to move across country and work for my uncle's fencing company in South Florida. Currently, he has me doing commercial sales / estimates, where I am able to network with different contractors daily. This was not even a department before I moved here in June '24, so I alone am forming all of these relationships with contractors. I feel like I am in a very good spot with how young I am right now. I am focused on learning / being a sponge daily, and I do not take this position for granted. However, this is not my end goal. 
 
I have always had an interest in real estate, specifically my goal is to get into real estate development or investing one day. Being in the position I am now makes me want to achieve this goal even more. To achieve this goal, I feel like my best path is to get an MBA, but I do not know that for sure. I have done some research, and I'm just not sure if I should just get a general MBA, or continue my specialization in real estate. I know that this is the job market I want to get into, and I feel like it is my passion. I just don't know how to get there. I've looked at some smaller online MBAs, such as University of Illinois, or Southern Illinois University (where I graduated,) but these programs are not impressively high ranking at all. 
 
I guess why I came on here is to try to hear someone's point of view that has done it, or even working to achieve the same goal I am. I'm mainly looking at online MBAs, and my questions are: Is it even worth it in 2024 to get an MBA to achieve my goal? Specifically, should I go to a smaller, less expensive school, or spend thousands more to go to a well ranked one? Should I specialize, or is a general online MBA fine? Should I even do an online MBA, or would it be worth the money to invest in a on campus one? Again, please note that I work full time.
 
I really hope someone on here can help me out, I just want some different points of view on this. I've prayed and prayed, but I do not know what to do. I'm really young, and I acknowledge that I have lots of time, but I am an overthinker that has always had higher than average goals. Thank you for your time, any advise is appreciated!

t3_1fvhbha,New construction home next to draining ditch/pond question (Raleigh area in Clayton NC),"Hi everyone,

I am looking at potentially purchasing a new construction home in Clayton, NC. It backs up to trees and also has a retention pond/drainage ditch of sorts next to it, with more trees behind that.

I prefer not to be next to other homes which is why this lot is appealing however I am concerned about bugs and any other issues that could arise from being next to the standing water. I have lived in the Raleigh area for a few years but high up in an apartment and never had bug problems.

Not sure what to expect moving into a home like this in Clayton and if I should possibly consider one of the lots not right next to the pond. I keep reading about people having horrible issues with bugs in the Raleigh/Clayton area and with a new house and getting the outside treated for insects, will I really still see tons of bugs getting inside?

t3_1fvds93,Shared Gas Meter between two houses in NYC,"So my family and I are looking into buying two houses right next to each other in NYC that are quite interesting.

The main house has existed for over 50 years, and in the early 2000s, the owners built another house on the lot and has made it a legal property with its own block and lot information since 2010. (The lot was big enough to do this). I’ve cross checked the tax information for both properties and they are filed individually.

However, the problem is, both houses share a single gas meter. Will this be a problem? Is it legal? Do you guys recommend separating, and if so, how much would this run us? The electrical is separate so we’re all good there.

t3_1fvnow4,"If the new DOJ agreements have an impact on prices, how long will it take to see results?","Obviously, it would be hard to say exactly, because of prices go up for other reasons or down for other reasons It's hard to know. But I'm sure experts and economists can isolate different variables and have an idea. In Washington, we don't participate in that agreement with our NWMLS, Northwest multiple listing service. But, it's certainly been in the news and we've been making sellers aware of the negotiability of commissions for years. As far as I can see, people are still offering two and a half to 3%, with a few 2% on higher ends here and there. 

Personally, I think it's a big tempest in a teapot and wasn't really a problem in the first place and will not bring prices down or stop them from going up. But that's just me .

Not much point in arguing about a lot of this, but, I'm just wondering, if people think it is going to have an impact, how long will it take. Is it happening yet? Will it take a year? Has it had any impact yet in various areas?

t3_1fux81z,WNC disaster happened while I’m under contract on two houses (selling one and buying the other),"So I am in an area (Western NC) with massive devastation after the hurricane. I had just put my house under contract and signed a contract to buy another in the same area.

 My house did great, no damage. It’s actually very prepared because of my planning with a generator hookup and everything. (I’m running the whole house off my generator now). 

The house I am going to buy is 50 years old and I had planned to remodel some. It also did not sustain damage, but lost all the trees blocking it from a busy rural highway it overlooks, so less desirable. Also, in my inspection of the home I’m purchasing (had it done the day before the storm) quite a few issues came up including moisture. So I’m still waiting on an appraisal and I won’t be able to get anyone to give quotes on the issues because companies will be too busy after the storm (I do have a good idea on most cost except a few big ones). I still can’t drive to it because of down trees and no one is even airing it and it has no power still. My inspection period ends in 2 weeks. 

So, on the house I’m buying I was going to try to get the owners to come down on cost because of these issues before the storm. I was just going to get more information on the issues and appraisal before negotiating. So now I am wondering if I can’t get them to come down what kind of a housing market am I going to have to deal with? I know there will be a shortage, but how will that affect prices? I’m just worried I’m about to be homeless. 

Edit- my real question is what will this do to the real estate market? Immediately and over a little time. I am concerned the owners may not negotiate with me and I can’t walk into a money pit blind (the disaster won’t leave me with time to investigate further either and I think will leave very little rentals). But- A money pit house seems worse long term than being homeless/couch surfing awhile. "

t3_1fuzlam,Apartment Complex Basement,"
I am currently in the beginning stages of a planned 24-unit apartment complex. I have developed 1-4 family homes, but have an opportunity to do something larger thanks to a recent rezoning of a property I own. 

I’ve figured I can put a roughly 80x80 building on the site. There is an existing building there and this would sit essentially in the same spot but the new building will be slightly larger. The current building has a basement that I’ll need to rip out to put I. The larger one. But that has me thinking….should I even put one?

There’s obviously advantages to having the extra space. I could find ways to add additional revenue through storage locker rentals or other ideas. Plus, if you’re going to do it now is really the only time to do it. You can’t really go back in after the fact and add one if you decide you need it later. 

But there are also drop backs. Basements have a tendency to have moisture and humidity issues. It bumps up the cost a good amount over a slab. The front door would require steps to get into the building, etc. 

So what are your thoughts? Basement or no basement?"

t3_1fvc6z1,Buyer Beware,"After the recent NAR ruling took effect, many realtors are saying that it is now required that house buyers sign a buyers agreement in order to view a house. This is not true. The truth is that the buyers agreement only needs to be signed for the agent to work as your buyers agent, and essentially is your agreement to work with the buyers agent as your agent.

Read what a realtor hands to you VERY CAREFULLY before signing, especially if you only wanted to view a property and are not ready to choose a buyers agent. Realtors are passing buyers agreements off as routine paper work that is ""required"" to be signed in order for them to show the house.

Agents are using this paperwork to entrap potential buyers into a legally binding agreement that requires the buyer to use them as their sole and exclusive agent for a determined amount of time.

The paperwork may be filled out already and will say something along the lines of:

SERVICES PROVIDED. Buyer hereby agrees to hire the Agency on a(n): (check one)

☐ - Exclusive Basis. To accept the terms of this Agreement and communicate with the
Agency on an exclusive basis in their efforts to assist in acquiring real property that
meets the wants and needs of the Buyer through either purchase, option, exchange, 
trade, or lease. The Commission, under an exclusive basis, is due and payable even 
under the circumstance the Buyer acquires real property on their own without the 
assistance or involvement of the Agency.

☐ - Non-Exclusive Basis. To accept the terms of this Agreement and communicate
with the Agency on a non-exclusive basis in their efforts to assist in acquiring real
property that meets the wants and needs of the Buyer through either purchase, option, 
exchange, trade, or lease. The Commission, under a non-exclusive basis, is due and 
payable only if the Buyer acquires real property with the assistance and involvement of 
the Agency. In the event the Buyer purchases real property during the Listing Period 
without the use of the Agency, the Agency shall not be due a Commission.

If you are not wanting to use the agent showing you the property as your agent for buying:

1. Do not sign the paperwork

OR

2. Make sure that the paperwork outlines that the agent showing you the property is working on a non-exclusive basis AND the remainder of the paperwork says nothing obligating you to pay commission to the agent showing you the property unless you choose to place an offer on the property through them (the agent).

You can politely decline and say that you haven't yet decided who you want to represent you as your buyers agent, but you are open to the possibility of using them if they seem like a good fit.

OTHERWISE

You may be legally obligated to pay commission to this buyers agent that you just met and just learned the name of, even if you decided to work with another agent, until the contract that you signed expires. Yes, that could mean paying commission to TWO buyers agents.

Hi All, my seller/selling agent on MLS data stated that home is fully fenced. Few months after buying house we came to know that one of the fence may be completely owned by neighbour. We have 3 neighbours, seems like other 2 side of fence is ok as its shared.

We painted the fence thinking its ours and neighbour complained its their fence and replaced the fence and asking us for money(around usd 2500). 
Also we this portion is now different color than our paint of rest of fence so at some point we have to put new fence for that portion and paint with same color again(2500 usd around again)

The seller or seller agent are not responding to us now whether they paid for that fence or its shared or not.

It was 90 degrees and did not cool down at all even when I tried lowering the ac.
There was a water stain on one of the closet walls.
The property is originally listed for 250k but over the months they decreased the price about 4x and it's now listed for 200k.
My realtor said to offer 190k and ask them for 2.5% closing costs. I do not agree. All the other properties in the area have been sold for a little less.

t3_1fuy6b7,"Complex situation, need any help or advice you can provide. ","First off, thanks for taking the time to look at this. We are probably going to have to hire a lawyer for all this, but I was hoping to get some opinions or advice before we jump in. Here is the background information.

My grandpa is currently in the midst of passing away. As such, his home is currently held by a trust. My understanding from my mother is that they way everything is written up, the house will be sold and the proceeds split 50/50 between my mother and her brother (my grandpa's children). My mother is insistent that the home remain in the family as it is a fairly nice place in a decent location. She really wants me to buy it, but I have no interest in taking on a mortgage at this time due to multiple reasons. I bought my house after the housing market crash back in like 2008 when it was in foreclosure so I got it insanely cheap and own it outright. Also, my current home is basically a construction zone as I have been remodeling the entire thing since all my kids have grown and left the house. As such, I am not in a position to sell my house at the moment without taking a huge loss on what I could get for it later when it is finished. 

Knowing all of this, my mother has said to me that she wants to buy the house from the trust with the other money she is getting from my grandpa passing. By doing this, she thinks that half the money will go to her brother and she will just get half of it back. Then she wants me to have the house and pay her slowly over the next few years while working on my current house so that when I do sell my house I can pay her whatever is left on the total that she spent and she would sign it over to me. Basically a no interest rent to own situation. Clearly for me this is a huge opportunity as it would allow me to have a newer and nicer home without having to pay almost double the cost of the home due to the interest on the mortgage. 

I have several questions regarding this whole scenario:

1. Is there a cheap and easy way that my mother can work with the trust and her brother to just sign it over to either me or her to avoid having to do the whole ""sale"" thing as she is basically buying it from herself?
2. She is fine with it going directly into my name. But I thought it would be better for her to put it in her name now. That way, if something were to happen to me during the next few years she would have all the money I paid her plus still retain the rights to the house. Basically insurance against losing out on the value of the house. Not sure which way is best to proceed on this. 
3. Can this all be done without including a real estate agent? As the house will never really need to be listed, or shown to other buyers, I see no reason why we would pay someone $10-12k for my mother to buy the house from herself. 
4. If this can all be handled just with an attorney and my mother and her brother signing off on it, what do you think the total cost of the ""sale"" would be? What I mean is how much do you think a lawyer will cost and since no agent or bank or anything will be used, I assume there would be no other costs than just transferring the title? Am I missing something here?
5. If you have any other advice or anything to add to this scenario, feel free to include that. We are both completely in the dark on this one, but don't want to pay tons of extra money that doesn't need to be spent just because we are clueless and someone saw an easy mark. 

If you got this far, thanks again for taking the time to help. Any and all comments and advice or information is welcome. We live in Michigan, if that affects the legal side of it all.

t3_1fut7uw,First-Time Homebuyers Torn Between House or Mobile Home—Help Us Decide,"(Edit: Thanks everyone for responses was very helpful and actually learned quite a bit! A lot of this is pretty basic I am sure for most you but you have taught me quite a bit with this. It's been very helpful and feel much more confident buying the home vs trailer now)  
  
Hi all,

Sorry for the long post. My wife and I are new to this and aren't sure what move we should make.

We both grew up in poor households, and after a few decades of hard work, we've finally reached a point where we are actually middle class, though still on the lower end. We’ve been paying so much in rent that we finally decided it’s time to buy a house. With the help of various programs and our savings, we've managed to save around $30,000 for a down payment.

For context, we currently live in one of the fastest-growing major cities in the U.S., and the city is expected to see a 75% population increase by 2050, so buying here seems like a smart move. We also don't have children, which helps our financial situation.

We’re currently weighing two options:

1. **House Purchase**: We could buy a decent house here for around $250,000 with a $30,000 down payment and an interest rate of around 6%. The monthly payments would be lower than our current rent, though we'd be responsible for repairs and maintenance. This would be a 30-year mortgage. While we’ve done well to get to this point, it’s required us to be very frugal (we both drive used cars, don’t vacation often, etc.). That frugality is how we saved enough for a down payment.
2. **Mobile Home Purchase**: A very nice trailer has come on the market in a trailer court, oddly located near downtown. The park has extremely strict rules, and the lot payment is $600 a month, though it’s subject to change. We can buy the trailer outright for $20,000. The trailer lot owners are also the sellers. We have no issue living in a mobile home, and being close to downtown is a huge plus. This particular park is well-run and well-maintained.

We're really torn between these two options. On one hand, we could get a small, comfortable house, but the payments would force us to continue living frugally and avoid things like new car payments. On the other hand, the mobile home is an easier, debt-free option, but I’m not sure if it’s a wise long-term decision. Given the proximity to downtown, the trailer lot could easily be sold off for condos, and who knows what the park might be like in 10 years? Also, if we go with the mobile home, we’d lose out on the first-time homebuyer programs our state offers for future purchases.

That said, being debt-free would allow my wife to finally get a decent car.

We've rented our entire lives and have no experience with buying a house. I thought I'd ask for advice here. We need to make a decision quickly, as the trailer likely won’t stay on the market for long at that price, and our real estate agent is eager to start showing us houses.

Any advice or suggestions on which route to take? For reference, our income should remain steady with about a 3% annual increase."
t3_1funme9,Backup Offers?,"Can someone explain how Backup Offers work?  We’ve had are home on the market for almost 40 days and have had some really good showings. We’ve had two showing with one couple and they are preparing to submit an all cash offer but the home that we had been keeping an eye on went Under Contract yesterday afternoon. It says Accepting Backup Offers. What does this mean exactly?

Does it mean the potential buyer submitted a low offer and they accepted with the hopes someone else would make a higher offer? Can the seller accept a higher offer during this period?  If it is contingent on the sale of the buyers home, would our offer be stronger if we go Under Contract on our current home?"

Non paywalled: https://archive.is/fawWw

&gt; ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.—Kellen Driscoll bought his home here in 2019, settling in the coastal enclave of Shore Acres. It flooded for the first time four years ago after tropical storm Eta dumped more than 3 feet of water.

&gt; Hoping it was a fluke, Driscoll tore out the affected drywall and started fresh. After all, the four-bedroom home built in 1960 had no flood history. 

&gt; But then it happened again, and again. Like many others in the community, he put his home up for sale in the spring of this year. After seeing little interest, he cut the asking price. 

&gt; On Friday, Hurricane Helene deposited more than 6 feet of storm surge in the neighborhood. The rushing waters ripped the “For Sale” sign off his front lawn, and etched a waterline that reached halfway up his front door, just underneath the doorbell. He reduced the asking price for a fifth time.

&gt; “We flooded here four times in the last four years,” said Driscoll, as he threw his television sets, furniture, appliances and other belongings to the curb. “I’m just hoping I can sell the house. It’s a good neighborhood for sure, but dealing with the floods is horrible.”"

t3_1fuzixs,Home assessed value is up but taxes remain about the same,"I'm a homeowner, and school district taxes are out.
Apparently my home's assessed value is up by over 8% from last year, yet due to a different calculation of taxes (lower tax per assessed $ value), it's just about the same actual dollar value as it was last year.

The new value they assessed my house at, is 99% correlated with Zillow - not sure if they go off Zillow or similar, or if it's just correlated.

Considering I had to fix a lot of things in the house, and I'm still working on it, the real market value is not even close to the assessment - I can barely sell it for what I bought it at, _after_ having done some pretty extensive renovations. I bought the house at a stressful period, and I was eager to just snatch something, be it as it is.
I bought the house in March 2024.

I suppose some would wonder why I would contest it, if the $ value of the taxes remains the same, and well, if I can successfully contest it, I can lower my tax, so tax _remaining static_ is not a valid argument - if the tax unit per $ assessed is down, it's an opportunity to pay less tax (if I can successfully contest).
Additionally, I don't know if county and city tax will act in the same way as school tax.
And if there's one thing that's almost certain, it's that taxes don't really go down.

There is however an additional consideration - would contesting the assessment affect anything else?
Can it have an effect on the house's is resell value?
In other words - does a high assessor's assessed value ever have a positive impact?"

So many people are saying this is way too much of a payment for me but I'm not sure. The fact that we can still put $3.5k a month is savings tells me we're gunna be okay. Also, I would rather have 25k in a HYSA @4.5% than pay off my car that has a .99% rate.

t3_1fupoex,Advice needed for negotiating with a buyers agent as the buyer in GA,"So here's the 'stich-  \



I found a house in the area I have been looking on my own that I want to make a cash offer on. I tried to call several Georgia real estate attorneys but they either never called me back or told me they only handle closings, so I begrudgingly reached out to a real estate agent and asked if they could write up the offer for a flat fee, to which they responded ""the seller pays the commission, you don't need to worry about that.""I know this is no longer the law of the land, but I didn't argue the point because frankly, I was tired and uncertain about what to negotiate.  \



The agent showed us the house without asking us to sign anything but other than showing us the house, the agent either hasn't gotten any information out of the seller's agent or isn't sharing it. We decided on our offer amount and the agent sends a copy of the buyer-broker agreement that says the buyer is responsible for the 3% commission, that the agreement is good through the end of 2024 and that the buyer consents to dual agency should the situation arise.  
\


I absolutely do not want to be responsible for paying the agent 3% for a house that I found, let alone agree to be locked in for the next 3 months, possibly under dual agency. It says the seller's responsibility at closing is $0, I don't see where the agent even attempts to get the seller to pay the 3% commission, unless I am missing something. There's a few other things that feel wrong to me, so now I am wondering if I should counter this agent's agreement or say ""never mind"" and find someone else?"

Either way, we are not closing until they are out of the house. Thank you all for your advice. I have read every comment and appreciate your input so much. It’s helped me tremendously. 

++ 

I’m closing in two days and the seller’s realtor suddenly told our realtor that the sellers needs to stay in the house for a few more days until they close on their home. We asked to push the closing back and they are refusing to do that. They said they will not leave no matter what. They said they will not pay us rent for the time spent there either. They are willing to give money in the form of a security deposit though. 

My thought was just to close on the house and tell them they need to be out, and if they’re not then call the cops on them if they don’t leave. My partner doesn’t want to do this because of the bad impression it will make on new neighbors, the drama of it, etc. 

Our realtor is suggesting we just ask for more money in security deposit and say we keep the money if they are not out by a certain date. The sellers also do not want us there while they are living there, so just to be assholes we would plan on going over anyways and making them feel as awkward as humanely possible to encourage them to leave "

t3_1ftvhby,What to say to listing agent who claims he cannot legally show me a home without a buyers agent agreement in place? ,"Today, a listing agent said, ""If you call me as an unrepresented buyer interested in this property, I cannot legally show you the property without having a buyer's agent agreement in place that states I am your agent and what the buyers agent compensation will be, or you have to have your own buyer's agent."" In other words, he is claiming that it is illegal for a seller's agent to show their listed property to an unrepresented buyer.

How do you get around this? We are willing to hire a real estate attorney to handle drafting the offer and any remaining documents in the transaction should our offer be accepted.

How do you explain to a listing/sellers agent that they can show you the house (as the listing agent) without being your agent?

t3_1funjs2,Condoized Appraisal Cost,"Just need a sanity check. I'm getting a quote for $2,000 to appraise my property with 3 units on it for a partial release, which seems absurd. SFH appraisals have been around $450 for me before and it's not like this is 4X+ the work.

t3_1fun662,Solar PPA on home I'm interested in buying,"Received contracts for a home that I would love to call my own.. I knew going in the home had some sort of leased solar... after reviewing contracts I became aware of the following:

The seller states in the home purchase contract the buyer (me) MUST assume the solar lease or buy it out.

The buy out price has a formula in the solar PPA contract, but I do not have a price/number, as I do not have information required to compute the price (nor has the seller contacted the solar company asking for the buy out price)

The solar PPA is for $0.15/kWh with 2.4% yearly escalation (the price increases that amount each year). The contract states a minimum production rate and we are billed at whatever it PRODUCES (not what we use). Excess produced is sold back to the utility company at 1:1, but they are moving to TOU (time of use) billing, which means this becomes less desirable. It also means if the 2.4% outpaces the utility rates, I am actively losing money over this, not even factoring in the solar company owns my roof.

The contract was started in 2016 and is a 20 year contract, so I'd be on the hook for another 12ish years. Also the company the PPA is signed with went under and has since been resold to some other company, so I am not sure who currently gets paid and/or services/maintains the panels.

The roof was stated to be 20 years old in the home purchase contract, and my inspector showed me pictures and said there are missing shingles and parts of the roof which need to be fixed/replaced, including a part potentially under a solar panel. No evidence of leaks.

We went in about 35k over asking on a house listed around 1M.

My thoughts are that we should not be forced to assume the sellers lease (that was their decision to do that). The solar contract states the current owner must buy it out if the person they are selling their house to refuses to take it over, but, the home purchase agreement has language forcing me to accept the transfer of the PPA lease/contract, which I presume means I would default the home purchase contract if I refuse to take it over, and lose my EMD.



Any recommendations on how to navigate this?

My thoughts are to ask the seller to offer a concession on the home purchase price to offset 100% or at least 65% of the PPA buyout, which I could then decide to buy out when I redo the roof. Is this unreasonable?

We have not signed any contracts yet."

t3_1fulvu8,What to do with build discrepancies and workmanship issues that go unanswered?,"Built a new home in MN, from down payment to ""almost finished"" was about 12 months. ""Almost finished"" means we closed on old house so NEEDED to move into house where finish details were still left unfinished. 

We pointed out all issues during our final walkthrough and added them to the list. More than a month later, still haven't finished a fraction of the list items. 

The main issues that seem like a PITA to properly repair are wood floors cupped or bowed up at the edges,  cracked grout in floor tiles, and changes in the plan that were not signed off on. 

Floor cupping as discussed with a 3rd party flooring company, is unacceptable. Builders performance guidelines say something about not more than 1/16"" while I'm measuring peak to peak at almost 1/8"" across 24"". Builder says wait it out with humidity. Flooring company could possibly just want us to hire them to redo the floor so I'm taking their word with a tbsp of salt. 

Cracked grout is between every 2 or 3 tiles along the short end. 

 Garage was supposed to be a certain height for a car lift but it ended up being 6"" shorter than plan. On top of that, the garage foundation/wall was extended up an extra 3'. 

I'm tired of bugging the builders about all of these issues and only getting ""we're working on it"" responses. 

My fear going into this was that signing on the dotted line at closing meant we're on our own. 

How long do you wait before just getting a lawyer involved?

Would anyone have any clue why that is the case? The house just got listed two months ago for around $4m and it looks like the homeowner took out $1.5m from a private lender. Is it because he/she wanted to do a bridge loan? I just don't understand the logic behind this so anyone with some ideas on this, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks

t3_1fuqew3,Lowball Offer on Our Dream Home,"Hello! We have found our dream home in the suburbs of Vancouver, Canada. We want to make an offer, but we believe the property is extremely over priced for the area...

The sellers originally listed the house for $2.5M back in Spring 2023. This house is also a new home (nobody currently lives there). We have seen the house twice now and brought someone to do a little inspection to see why it may be sitting still after 1.5 years unsold. Everything looks ""by the book"" and nothing major stood out to them in terms of why it may be sitting unsold after 1.5 years.

We are selling our property in Vancouver and are getting most of our funds from that sale. 

We think the home isn't worth more than $2M and we would be comfortable with paying $1.8M for the home since it also requires paying GST since it's a new home. 

Is it worth putting in a ""low ball"" offer on the home since it's our dream home? What is the likelihood that they would take an offer $500+ K lower than originally priced? My realtor seems to think we shouldn't even try if it's lower than $2.3...

Is it a waste of time to put in an offer at $1.8?"

t3_1fu84t9,CA - Title Insurance where backyard fence is a few feet onto neighboring lot,"Hey All - in escrow and ran into a situation.  Turns out one of the side yard fences may be onto a neighboring lot owned by the city.  It's been standing for 40+ years and as that area is unusable by the city, I imagine noone has ever cared.  That said, im in escrow to purchase the property.

  
Will this cause any issues with getting lender title insurance (and thus a mortgage) on my property?

Paying down principle = 5.5% (technically)

Classic Redfin move. They want to make it harder for consumers to differentiate one listing offering a buyer brokerage compensation and one that does not.

t3_1fu4av0,Cash to close Question,"I'm currently in the process of buying my first home in IL, and could use a little reassurance about cash to close.

Originally had agreed to pay $110k, seller concessions of $6300.  My lender gave me a cash to close estimate of $4695.16.  

After the FHA appraisal, the assessment of the home value dropped to $101k (seller bought the home, lived there for 3 months, moved out of state and put it up on the market, so no good comps in the area as I understand it).

After some back and forth, seller is paying realtor fees, but no other concessions (which is fine, we can swing it).

The confusion comes in when the lender gave me a new 'rough' estimate.  Cash to close is now $9276.  When I say rough, he sent me a screen shot of his calculation tool.  He did state that we're still waiting on the new estimates from the title and underwriting, so this is a high estimate. That was 12 days ago at this point, and I still haven't gotten a more formal and complete estimate.

1. I don't understand how, if we didn't have the $6300 in concessions from the first estimate, CtC would be around $10,996, but with a drop of $9k in the home value/loan amount, the new estimate is only a $1720 difference

2. From what I've been researching, average CtC in IL is between 2-6% of purchase, this is more like 9%.

This is definitely my first rodeo, so I'm wondering if that (as of right now) CtC estimate could even be semi-accurate.  

Also, should I prep to get hit with something higher at the closing table? (Read too many horror stories with that being the case)"

It would be way easier for me to develop my career/move up in my field if we moved to the Atlanta area, but things are complicated as we are homeowners and not renters. 

The easy part is this: I DO have a job already and my boss has already approved of my decision to relocate, saying all I would need to do is email HR to let them know I would report to the ATL office in the event that I did move. However, there remains the issue of the house we already have… and we would prefer to buy a home in Georgia instead of rent. Several reasons for that but mostly, we’re mid-30’s and have two kids and don’t really savor the idea of apartment living with two kiddos under 4.

t3_1ftu0t1,Vulture letters,"One of my brothers passed in April, and I am the executor of the estate.  The estate had to go through probate, which makes the will public record along with my name/address since I was named executor.  As part of his estate planning, he did what's called a TODD - a Transfer on Death Deed.  This is in Minnesota, US.

What the TODD does is transfer the deed to a designated person and the house is not part of the estate.  The TODD named another brother as the beneficiary (not sure that's the correct term) of the TODD.  So, 30 days after death, the lawyer files paperwork with the county and the house deed is now in my living brother's name as if he owned it all along.  The owner's name is also changed on the county records.

However, since probate was filed (in May) until now I have continued to receive letters and phone calls regarding selling the house.  I got a call the day after probate was filed.  Really?  My brother is barely dead and the vultures come out.  Many of the letters are 'official' looking, using ""probate"" in the return address.  

I have refused most of them and sent emails back to others.  It would take about 3 minutes of research to find out that the house is not in probate and the new owner is listed on the tax records for the county.

The house is on one end of a major metropolitan area and many of the letters are from realtors on the opposite side of the area and a different county.  

So, realtors - please do some research before sending out these letters.  Every time I get one, it makes me angry and sad.  "

i.e. how much out-of-pocket spend is it worth to have an agent for new construction?"

t3_1ft6w34,What could my MIL be scheming? ,"Sorry if this doesn't belong in this sub, but it is real estate related. I want to make it clear that I'm not asking for relationship advice.

Background context: Unfortunately, I have a MIL who hates me and is so upset that my husband and I bought a house together ""without consulting her first"", that she vowed to never step foot into our house. She's furious that I'm on the title. To this day, she hasn’t visited, skipped out on our Thanksgiving dinner, and has made no effort to see her 15-month-old granddaughter unless we drive more than an hour to her house. For some context, she's extremely overbearing, controlling and will throw a tantrum to get her way. Also, money is a huge deal to her, and she’s always had this belief that women are out to take financial advantage of their husbands (which honestly feels like projection to me). She thinks I'm riding on the coattails of my husband's success (he's a surgeon) despite the fact that my husband and I both work FT and have solid incomes, each making well into the six figures. She hates that I'm living a comfortable life and wishes I could suffer more (yes, she actually said that).

Out of nowhere, my MIL made a proposal to my husband. She told him she has some extra cash lying around (about 400k), and would like to either 1) invest in our house, and if we sell one day, she would take a percentage of the profits, or 2) she could loan us the $400k at a 3% interest rate to help us pay off our mortgage faster and save money. She claims it’s a low-risk way to park her money, and that it would benefit us too. I don't think she expects us to add her name to the title, but who knows. Her reasoning doesn’t sit right with me, especially since there are many other avenues that could easily give her a better return with less risk, like a CD. It feels odd that she was so opposed to us buying this house, but now wants to be financially involved.

I’m firmly against the idea due to how she’s treated me in the past, and I don’t trust her motives. She is crazy and has started lawsuits for really trivial matters. My husband, on the other hand, is disappointed because he sees it as a way to save a significant amount of money. We bought the house just over a year ago with a 6% interest rate, and living in a VHCOL, our mortgage is around $7k/month. Sure, we could save some money, but I don’t think it’s worth the potential strain it could cause in our relationship.

I have already said no to her proposal but out of curiosity, I want to know what others think her true intentions might be. **I'm wondering if there is some obscure real estate law that would allow her to have leverage if she loaned us money?** I can't help but to think she is scheming for a way to take more control or maybe she's found a way to screw me over. I just don't believe her motives are out of the kindness of her heart.

Update:

Thanks everyone for your comments. I feel validated that I'm not overreacting due to my biases against her. Accepting the offer was never on the table for me. My husband actually told her no as soon as she brought it up. I do agree it's her way of asserting control or gaining some kind of leverage. She often thinks 10 steps ahead so I wouldn't be surprised if she's trying to position herself ahead in case we divorce or something. "
t3_1ftwiou,First time homebuyer - Inspection Comcessions,"After 7 months of looking for a home in Illinois I finally had an offer accepted. This home is 60 years old so of course I expected some upgrades and improvements needed, however our inspection came back with a laundry list of items and I am not sure how reasonable these things are to 1) Pay for myself and deal with it 2) ask seller to repair or provide seller credits for. I am assuming the deal with fail or will be a combination of 1 and 2. 

Roofing - water damage and elevated moisture levels suggest an active leak, this is a newer roof and the leak seems confined to one area of home. Additionally like stack flashings were installed incorrectly and need to be remedied. 

Electrical- Several GFCI receptacles are faulty
and incorrect breaker is incorrect for the air compressor (25 max amps) and 40 amp breaker is installed on main breaker. Additionally a water heater is using an extension cord where it should be permanent wiring. 

Plumbing-A leak in one bathroom in drain pipes at fittings / joints at sink. 

A toilet needs to be replaced due to recalled flushing mechanism (if I am being honest had plans to renovate this bathroom entirely so not a major concern) not the same bathroom as leak in sink! 

Dryer-Brass Gas Connector is a fire hazard and should be replaced with stainless steel

Rotted Window Sash in main living room window. 

There are other more minor issues as well. My major concern is plumbing electrical and roof.

t3_1fu0nfk,Buildertrend or Procore?,"Hi!

t3_1fu0m7i,Buying a renter occupied house,"Hi all! My wife and I found a great house in our budget, but of course there is renters currently occupying the house. Their lease goes until May 2025. Our own lease isn't up until June 2025 so that actually works out pretty well.

We are considering locking in this house since price have softened quite a bit in our area and interest rates are coming down. We fear that by May the market will have heated back up.

I am told that the tenants are aware that the house is for sale, and that they themselves are looking to buy a different house in the next 6 months. Theoretically there should be no problems with them moving out come May.

I am worried though about my mortgage. Would this be considered an investment property since I will not be occupying the house for \~6 months? Would that affect my interest rate? Also would I need to get a special landlord insurance?

Is this a bad idea?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: This is in Middle TN."
t3_1ftzjs9,Home Improvement Questions,"We might be selling our house in the next year. It is 60/40 stay/sell.

The reasons don't matter - there is no exigent factor that requires either decision. It is kind of a love-it or list-it scenario.

Our current house is lovely - our neighborhood is coveted (houses sell in under 90 days when they take up to 270 around us). Our house is the 'cheapest' on the block of high-end, executive homes.

Our house was also the first build on our sought-after street, so we have been working on replacing the 1998 vibes since we bought it 10 years ago.

We would like to do some improvements -  that I want to start planning to do or just do, now. We have already modernized our roof, windows, door and fully painted the house in a more modern color scheme inside and out (very well done, to the point that people coming to visit us drive past our house thinking it isn't us).

It has tons of curb appeal - if when it looked less than fantastic in in 1990's hues.

I'd like some help to organize the improvement list to just prioritize spending and time - but also with highest return on investment toward the top of the list, so that if we do sell, it has at least some repayment. We will enjoy all of these improvements, so I'm really looking to optimize for \_potential\_ resale to just drive up square foot valuation, which our market does support, especially as the cheapest house in the nicest neighborhood.

Details: a farmhouse-style, 4 bedroom, 3 bath, 3000 sqft  + 30x15 large room-over fully hvac'd garage spare room and partially finished basement in 1000 sqft of the space. We use the room-over-garage as a 5th bedroom but that technically only counts as extra space due to being under a hipped roof area.

Yes, I will be working with a realtor at some point. We just don't know if we are ready to do that yet.

Here's our list:

1. replace our garage doors with insulated, carriage-style doors (this is actually #1 on my list) - question is do I get a)  'best' door that has three-layer (steel, foam, steel), R-18.4 with wood look, steel carriage-ish door - these still have the obvious garage door panel. b) Or, would a full-out faux carriage door four layer (still wood-look steel, we live in the NE and I wouldn't do a wood door) but that hides the garage door panel.
2. Kitchen Countertops - replace high-end orginal laminate with

* granite?
* quartz ?
* corian (not favored in our area, but I love corian)
* soapstone (my second fave)
* marble ?

1. resurfacing cabinets - our cabinetry is high-end and could be visually improved - I would consider doors and or professionally painting. \*\*I will move before living through a kitchen remodel/cabinet replacement. Seriously, that is my line in the sand.
2. Full master bedroom ensuite redo/redesign. Our house was designed by its builder to showcase his building, not designed - so our master bedroom windows look into our neighbors garage (they keep it much neater than we do ours!)  - and our WIC and master bath take up the full scenic view of our densely wooded, multi-acre private lot, and we have four doors in and out of this space. I have a plan, on this, an architect lined up to do stamped drawings, and would GC this with trades myself (have done this before). Square footage would not change - storage, reducing doors
3. Leave the ensuite setup as is- Master bathroom redesign. Ugh our bathroom is horrible c 1998 - awful jet tub that I would gladly host a bonfire in, just poorly designed.
4. install 2 egress windows in basement and fully finish about half the basement - will not take much - rough out of electrical is done - plumbing access is in place for a 1/2 or full bath. This is below grade so it would not be a full-valuation improvement, but would be able to be counted as 'finished basement'
5. laundry room improvement - kind of like a California Closets optimization to make the space more functional - includes a laundry Chute (which I love, but not sure if it is desired or a detriment)
6. replace upstairs carpeting with  hardwood -either in hallway (about 30 lf of hallway) OR hallway and bedrooms
7. improve bathroom 2 &amp; 3
8. replace septic system retooling - we have it cleaned and inspected (always passing) on the regular. It is just aged; and they fail. And, our state is eyeing this up as public health opportunity. Redoing it could support upgrading us to a 'legal'
9. outside rear yard improvement - currently our rear yard is basic, trees, fire pits, functional gardens that we don't really do much with. We could get a hard/landscaper in and make it wow - but is that worth it? currently a nice large deck with slider. I always envisioned a large bricked patio with shelter; just have never done it.
10. complete landscaping of front yard to remove and redesign walkways away from house, tear out and replant a 15 x 40 kidney shaped tree garden.
11. raise the roof over the garage (the roof is seperate from our main roof, so this would not require a complete reroofing or look bad due to the existing separation) to capture the full over-garage square footage adding in about 450 sq ft of above-grade living space.

Would love some expert opinion on prioritizing these of projects - in terms of potential payback if we sell (again, these are the things that will happen over the next few years anyway, if we stay - I will be happy with any of them, and if we go want to make it worth the money and time as much as possible)."
t3_1ftzadi,DSCR Loan help,"Hey guys, i’m looking to buy my first investment property with no money out of pocket.

t3_1fty3yp,Seller Financing smart?,"Basically, I have owned a house in another state since 2010 and moved out of state in 2012. I did expect to move back a few years later due to work but work never brought me back. So now I have a house that I paid $94k for and haven’t paid for it due to tenants since 2012. I renovated the kitchen and lauded hardwood floor in kitchen, living room, and hallway.

I got a call, I said $150k, it’s marketed for $180k on real estate websites. They come back and said $105k cash (I owe $65k) or $200k seller finance.

Basically paying me $350/mo for 10 years or until the house sells to meet the $200k.

What is a smart move? I can put in $40-$50k of renovation to get it up to 2024 standard and sell it or rent it for higher myself. But being out of state, I can’t do that currently and moving overseas soon.

I might be retiring in 2027, no later than 2031."
t3_1fu7q0x,Is an appraisal letter of current home value good enough for Proof of Funds?,"My grandmother is selling her house and has an appraisal letter from just a couple months ago. She plans to sell her house before buying and pay fully in cash for a new home.

Would you consider an official home value appraisal enough grounds for scheduling house tours that usually require PoF, knowing that the plan is for the buyer to have the money by the time the purchase would occur?

EDIT: I realize I probably could have added a bit more context.

She has a lot of funds not currently tied up in the house, but the issue is that it’s split across various accounts and things because she’s still working on consolidating her finances after her late husband passed. It’s been a slow-going process and I was just curious if there’s a way we can see some houses before waiting for everything to settle. We are hoping to buy by end of year, and in the area we’re looking to move to houses tend to be on the market for a few months so a house we go and see now will probably still be for sale when we’re ready to make an offer. We’re looking in the $1-1.5M price range and her current house is in an extremely desirable location and will sell for about double that pretty much immediately. She has enough cash to put at least 50% down and pay the rest as soon as her house sells, or we’ll sell her house first and pay 100% in cash, depending on timing."

t3_1ftwg31,Failed inspection disclosure issue (Illinois),"Hello. My sewer scope inspection just failed due to orangeburg. This will likely be a $10K repair but my realtor, who was a sub for the main, seller-backed realtor, says that he will not have to disclose this because its sold as-is and therefore the sellers will not report this issue to any new buyers. I don't think this is correct, and it's important because the sellers are gonna be more apt to come down on my price if they gotta tell all the other buyers about it.

t3_1ftw2gl,Need advice on a rent-to-own,"So the wife and I recently purchased a new home, moved, all that. However we still own the old home and I have a really good friend that's currently renting a crappy place. Not going to get too into the details but a while back he got hired on at the place I work, is finally making respectable money and getting going on building his life up. Bro kinda started out on hard mode and I've been really rooting for him and proud of my boi as he improves his position. 

Now, the thing I need advice on. He wants to buy my old home and I'm all for it. After he brought it up the wife and I talked and we were like why not? Give him a little lower price than we would ask on the market and go private sale and not have the house sit on the market for months while getting him a house he really wants and setting him up. Win/win. We're a rural community and home prices are pretty low compared to the rest of the country. That being said, he couldn't get the financing on his own (DTI) and with his wife on he said the bank couldn't do it with his lack of employment history. He'll get the employment history in just a few months and suggested a rent-to-own as an option. Wife and I have been pretty uninterested in being ""landlords"" or anything. Buddy says he understands if that's something we can't do and I would love to help the guy out but I'm not familiar enough with this stuff. We do pretty well for a couple under 30 and I'm just worried that if we did a short term rent-to-own maybe he wouldn't get approved still and then we're either stuck as rental owners with a friend renting which I'm sure everybody would agree is not an ideal situation or he'd have to move out and find a new place with a kiddo on the way around that time. 

I just don't know. He's the kind of guy from the scene in The Town ""Whose car we gonna take?"" and I'd love to help the guy out but I'm afraid of going forward with it and then losing a friend over business and all that kinda stuff. I also feel shitty telling him ""Sorry bro I can't do it"" and putting it on the market. 

Look forward to hearing what some of you have for advice"

In our area the condos we’re looking at are around $350K-400K and our forever homes are around $600-700K.

t3_1ftud1r,Renting Primary Residence when Moving across country,"So my fiancee and I own a home in South Fl. We purchased in 2022 with a rate of 3.6%  some stuff has come up m, she got a new job and we want to be back closer to family so we have relocated to the West and we are renting a house for atleast the first year. We are working with a property management company to rent our house but they just keep recommending we drop the price $100 each week. Doesn't feel like they're actively trying to get someone in. 

Overall, I think the home will rent for about $400/mo lower than our total mortgage and hoa fees. Our loan currently pays principal of 575-600/month. 

I'm torn because I like the house a lot, don't want to sell it, and there's the chance we could want to move back to FL if we don't like it out here. But then there's part of me that says just sell it.  Thoughts on renting for lower than mortgage while we figure out future life plans?  If we sell and decide to come back, we would probably not be able to afford to buy a similar home to what we had due to higher rates and appreciation.

t3_1fttij5,Should I buy a home?,"I know this is reddit, so I'm not going to take advice without any thought, but I'd like to hear thoughts on my situation and whether buying a house is a good idea.  
I'm 28 and me and my SO are looking at buying a house soon.

The home we're looking at is $630,000 and the rate we're looking at is 5.25% with about $20,000 worth of points. The home is available in January and would involve breaking our lease for around $9,000 (it's high because we received concessions). The HOA is $320/month.

Our financial situation is as follows:

Me: $130k in cash, 108k in stocks, 30k in Roth IRA, 165k in 401k

Salary: $128k/yr

SO: $50k in cash, 25k in stocks, 25k in Roth IRA, 35k in 401k

Salary: $90k/yr

The cash to close would be about $158k (not including $9000 for lease break). So it would be about 167k.

Any advice on how to go about paying this (for example, taking out of Roth IRA vs cash or something like that) is appreciated.

Any thoughts on buying a home being a bad idea in my situation is also appreciated!

We currently have no kids, but plan on it soon and just feel it is better to buy a home sooner rather than later. We like the area of the home and can see ourselves their for 10+ years. It is one of the last end unit townhomes in the development for a reasonable price for the area so that's why we're looking at breaking our lease to get it. If we don't get this one, we will likely have to look about 10-15 minutes further away from the city for a home and the commute for this townhome is very close to that maximum we are willing to travel to work, any further would definitely be burdensome.

Again, any thoughts are appreciated! Just looking for a vibe check from the reddit community."

t3_1ftswyg,Is it smart to get a standalone HELOC to renovate my mother's house?,"Hoping to get some input if this makes sense. I was previously planning to buy my own home and realized how competitive the market is and the interest rate is just too high for my liking and I hate overpaying, lol. I came up with the idea with my partner and my mother to what if I take over the house by without having to sign over the mortgage to me and just take maybe a $100k HELOC loan for renovations with a 30 years term in hopes to pay more along the way and pay off earlier. The house is in good condition and this is merely for aesthetic purposes which is why I want a $100k renovation. I would pay the mortgage even though it's under her name then maybe after 5 years, sign it over to me. I have a 785 credit score and do make $100k a year with some student loans and car loan debt with a monthly expense total of $1000 (varies based on my credit card use so without it would be $800 - this includes car insurance. Other misc maybe about $500). My partner (makes about $40k a year with a monthly car payment of $500 - I don't want him to cosign as he doesn't have a good credit score) and mother would still help with expenses so I have no issue preventing myself living paycheck to paycheck. I currently rent so after my lease ends, we would go back to my mother's. We have lived with her before so it's no issue there - she lives alone. Is this possible if I have no mortgage? "

t3_1ftsdej,Asbestos ,"This is a long shot … My boyfriend bought a house built in 1950 (210k) and bypassed doing an inspection. He has not moved in yet and has been renovating the outside as it’s easier to do with nicer weather. He began to do some work inside, like renovating closets, bathrooms, etc. when renovating a ceiling in the closet of his room, this gray, dusty, gold-like substance came pouring out. He didn’t know what it was and proceeded to sweep it up. Turns out, it’s Vermiculite and around 70% of it ever made during that time has asbestos. My boyfriend is a VERY health-conscious person and does not feel comfortable living in the home or continuing to do renovations as it risks more exposure. Even if it was “cleaned up”, he still doesn’t feel safe enough to live there. He feels so lost and I feel horribly for him. He has bought so much for that home, much of which cannot be returned at this point (15k). The price for complete removal is outrageous (20k+) and it’s even outrageous to only have one room cleaned ($2500) and air test ($1200).  NYS won’t test the vermiculite, and contractors have notified him that even the joints for the drywall pose a risk ($7500/room). He’s in such a bad spot and feels like there’s no good option for him. Any information of any kind would be helpful as we are both so lost. "

t3_1ftqvx1,Intrafamily loan ,"My parents are moving to a senior community, and my wife and I would like to buy their house. They had been advised to sell it to us for fair market value. They do not owe anything on the house, and they don’t need money from us to support them.

We would need a sizable loan to be able to buy their house. My dad is willing to do a family loan and he’s OK with us paying the interest only which would be set at the AFR. But he’s not thrilled about gifting a lot of money, because the potential cost of memory care for my mom is a huge unknown. 

I have one sister who doesn’t want the house, doesn’t need the money, and my dad doesn’t feel like the value of the house needs to be split with her at the time of inheritance. Currently, my parents will are set up so that the entire estate is split evenly. Dad said that if we do this, all of the interest payments we make on the house should revert back to me.

So my questions are:

1. If Dad does gift to me (up to the $18k annual Lyne for reporting ) and that money is applied to the principal, then it stays with him and he can use it whenever he needs to for mom‘s care, right? Meanwhile, the principal gets reduced each year, so the loan would be paid off in X years, hopefully before the time of inheritance.

2 a. If there is no gifting and we’re paying him interest only, we would still owe the entire principal to the estate at the end of the loan term. So should we set the term to 30 years since we know this will take us past the time of inheritance, and then I could use my inheritance to pay off the estate?

2 b. Or should we set this up as a 9 year loan to get the lower AFR? Then after 9 years, could we refinance with him with the same terms, and keep doing that every nine 9 until the time of inheritance? 

3. If I’m using my inheritance to pay off the loan, that basically means I’m paying half of that to my sister. My dad doesn’t want that, so should the loan agreement include forgiveness upon my parents deaths?"

I debated selling it last summer but because the market is very saturated I had trouble and the offers I got were just plain ludicrous so hoping the market comes back there. Not putting anymore into it than I need to currently in case I end up taking a hit on the equity as it's in flux at the moment. I've been saving a lot and am looking to invest in a place of my own.

**More importantly,** I've been in some bad relationships so I know the ins and outs of what to look for in a partner, but am currently in a very good one.  Trial and error, therapy, etc have led me to a good partner I've been seeing for 2 years I moved into her place in Rhode Island a year ago, and love the home. 

My partner mortgages the home, is gainfully employed and is getting her Master's.  She is driven but as we know wages sometimes outpace the cost of living. In short, she can afford the home but is ""house-poor"". She bought it with an ex-husband who signed it away to her at the divorce (lucky!). I do pay her rent but we prorated a lot of that to her to pay off credit card debts and now she is debt-free. In short, I've been helping her also become Financially independent with no debt etc.

It's a long journey for her but **I'd like to buy half the equity in her house.  She needs to refinance this summer anyway according to the agreement upon her divorce, and while I pay rent I don't feel a ""stake"" in the home.  I do help out, I'm not a freeloader, we share responsibilities, I repair things, I mow, and I help a lot but for once I'd like to ""own something"".  I have enough to buy my half outright and she offered to refinance for the original loan amount with me not the new value of the house, it's a win-win for her and for me as her bills would get cut in half.**

**BUT I'm drawing dead on what the process is...where do I start? A Real Estate Lawyer, the Mortgage Lender?  Any help on the process would be great.**

  
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, We will never be getting married. We have both decided on this and are happy with that situation. Also, I told her whatever we decide she has first rights to buy the house in the event of the breakup and can buy me out for half (assuming we can write that into a contract).  I really don't care and see this as only fair as it was her home to begin with.

Thanks all! Really need some help on this one!"

t3_1ftijm3,Lounge/ diner - am I making a massive mistake?,"Lounge/ diner - am I making a massive mistake?

Fallen in love with a house which is great size, characterful, modernish (despite the longe diner), gorgeous well developed south facing garden and decking area, big bedrooms and lovely road with outstanding schools….. however it has a large lounge / diner and no other rooms downstairs. There is potential to knock through but it’ll be costly and we will have no money left after purchase. We already need to build a new bathroom upstairs and potentially separate one of the large bedrooms, strip wall paper and buy an outdoor storage facility.

I’ve only ever known a social, eat in kitchen - there not even room for a brekky bar.

Do you think we’ll get used to it or regret it forever? How fundamental is a kitchen / diner as opposed to a large longer / diner?

We are a family of four. One older child and one baby. We’ve also been looking for nearly a year - sold our house so could potentially lose buyers if we don’t find somewhere. No prepared to rent and with it coming up to October I feel like we’re at the the end of the housing season so need to find somewhere and settle really.

t3_1ftekxc,First Street Flood Factor inaccuracies,"Hi all, does anyone have any success stories regarding getting a map changed with First Street's Flood Factor data?  They have drawn a river through my home and have the culvert where the water actually flows under the street as high and dry.

Superiority complex on steroids...  How can a company release a product that has the potential to cause significant financial harm to someone **and** have an actual policy that says they are smarter than you, don't bother trying?!

[realtor.com](http://realtor.com) actually agreed with me and at least removed the flood score, but the map looks devastating and is out of their control (though I think they have a little responsibility here to keep their vendor honest).  Kudos to them regardless for having a Customer Care department though.  They were pleasant to interact with.

Frustrated in the time I've put into this...  Frustrated that I don't know how to resolve it...  In one part of their site they seem to entertain the vague possibility of *maybe* listening if the person shows up with a FEMA LOMA letter.  As best I can tell, that involves me having to go hire a survey crew.  I'll be mad if I have to do that, but in other parts of their site they are adamant that their data is better than FEMA and say that FEMA data is irrelevant, so I'm not sure what a LOMA letter would actually change.  I'd be way more mad if I went through the hassle, time and expense of that only to find that it didn't move the needle with First Street.

Anyone have success tips they can share?"

t3_1ft6f5n,"Ethics question, advice","We're in the early stages of preparing to put our primary residence on the market. VHCOL area and our home is in the 90th percentile of price for the town. Not quite the tippy top but very close.

As part of the process we're doing our due diligence and meeting with the leading agents in the area.

During one of the meetings, an agent claimed to have a current buyer in-hand who they were due to show comparable homes to literally two days after our meeting. They showed us screen shots indicating proof of funds for said buyer (including the person's name, which felt icky to me and possibly unethical if not illegal though not the point of my post; I later googled and found the person to be a plausible buyer of such homes). Agent also said he had a signed agreement with this person to represent him as a buyer's broker for 2.5%.

I said great feel free to bring them by, we'd tidy up, etc. He then said I'd need to sign an exclusive, non-MLS pocket listing in order for him to show the house. I told him he could show it FSBO. He said no, he needed a signed seller's agreement because he had a fiduciary responsibility to his buyer to get him the lowest price possible, part of which included trying to get me, as seller, to pay the fee.

I told him he could do that as part of any offer and subsequent negotiation. I also reminded him that once I signed a seller's agreement he'd then have a fiduciary responsibility to *me.* I told him that I maintained that he could show it FSBO and that regardless I was not prepared to sign anything with anyone at this moment. And...that was the last I heard from him.

Thoughts? Was he just grubbing for the listing? If he did have a live buyer, shouldn't he have shown our home or at least presented it as an option?"

t3_1ftaxee,Is this just how it is?,"So I’ll do my best to keep this short…

We have outgrown our current house that we bought in 2017. Thanks to the increase in home prices we have a nice chunk of equity in our home that we can use for a down payment on a bigger place. 

We’ve gone through the usual buying and selling process up to this point. Pre approval, got our house on the market, toured homes, put in an offer on a home we like, got an offer on our home etc. 

We were initially going to go with a conventional loan on the new home, but due to some things that came up throughout the process we are now going FHA. 

We are now 3 weeks out from closing. We’ve done our inspection on the new home. The buyers of our home did their inspection. ROCs have been signed and we are getting ready move on to appraisals. 

Well this morning our mortgage guy calls and says “hey, we can’t do FHA on that house due to the 90 day flip rule.” The seller of this home is an investor and moved the home from one LLC to another before putting it on the market. So now we are being told instead of closing in 3 weeks, it’s going to be pushed until the end of December. 

My question is, why wasn’t this caught earlier? This seems like something that should’ve been reviewed before parties agreeing to move forward with FHA. 

We explored going back to the conventional loan route, but the debt-to-income ratio is like right on the line and I’d have to pay off some debt at closing and it puts the closing cost just outside of what we can afford. 

If that wasn’t enough of a hurdle. About an hour later the mortgage calls again and says he reviewed one of my documents I submitted and that it says there is a lien on my current home and that we won’t even be able to sell it so the whole deal is most likely off. To clear this up, our family went through something tragic, one of my loans defaulted and I was served papers. We went to mediation, reach an agreement and I’ve been making payments since. In the document about the repayment plan that I sent to the mortgage guy it mentions that a lien “could be” issued but never was. I even confirmed this with my attorney. So he’s jumping to conclusions and now saying he needs to look into mortgage guidelines and see if we are even eligible for a mortgage. Again, why wasn’t this caught and brought into question earlier??

So all that to ask the question in the title. Is catching things like this at this stage normal? And shouldn’t these things be looked into by the real estate agents and title companies and not the mortgage company? Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated. We are feeling defeated at the moment. "

t3_1ftaeas,Buying a house in a different state a year before I move,"I am currently renting in my current state. I recently re-signed my lease, which ends next year in August.

I've been looking at homes online **in a different state** (where I grew up) for a few months now and came across something I like at the right price. I've been in contact with the seller's agent and it seems we might be able to get an offer accepted.

I was excited until I came across the difference between **primary resident mortgage vs investment mortgage.** 

If I bought a house now, my plan was to find a renter for 1 year and then move in afterwards. From what I've gathered about primary residence mortgages, is this illegal and considered mortgage fraud? I find it hard to believe that homebuyers are kind of forced to only look for homes with 1-4 months left on their leases unless they want to throw away a ton of money from either their lease or empty home.

So, are these the only options?

- Wait until May-July 2025 to look for a house.

- Buy now. Move in. Lose money on my lease (my lease has no early termination clause. I could try negotiating with my landlord, of course.)

- Get an investment mortgage and go with the original plan (Judging by rates, probably a no-go)

edit: Appreciate the replies and it seems I have an answer. I'll add an additional note that my job is indeed remote and I've gotten approved for a move without issue."

t3_1fta0rz,Help a newbie!,"Hello community! New investor here need advice on a deal I am about to do. Feel free to roast, criticize or give any advice you have I can take it. Backstory: 22 years old about to get out of military after first contract. 70k cash saved up &amp; 775 credit score, no debt. Looking to buy duplex to live in and ultimately renovate if the numbers make sense. I am approved to use VA loan at 5.5% guaranteed. Here are the numbers:
Purchase price: 300k @5.5% (might be able to negotiate new exterior paint job credit)
Monthly costs: mortgage- 1703 tax-245 (2933/yr) insurance- 167
Market rents are 1600$ easy for both sides as is but currently being rented at 1410 and 1325 tenets pay all utilities (separately metered)
Planning on putting aside 20% of rents for Maint, vacancy, capex and will be self managing property. 
Property is fine as is but if fully renovated in my market I estimate 500k-550k ARV. This is a 2500 sq foot 3 bed 2 bath both sides. After renovation rents would be 1900-2000$ so about 4,000$ total rent for both units. If I did the BRRRR method would this work out perfect? 300k purchase + 10-15k closing + 80k remodel + 5k for refinance costs. 80k remodel number I got from my father who is a general contractor in the area. 500k ARV x .80% refi (because it would be my primary residence) = 400k minus 15k closing, 80k remodel, 5k refi cost = 300k my original purchase price. 
Property details: 3 bed 2 bath both sides with attached garages, aluminum siding, copper plumbing, 1972 construction, separately metered, all electric water heater, range, dryer, public water and public sewer on a slab foundation in a great school district right next to brand new construction everywhere. 

My only cash investment would be the 10-15k of closing costs as of right now. I am very very new this is the first house I am ever buying. 
Any advice is welcome. Am I getting a good deal as is? Should I keep it as is or renovate? Do numbers look accurate? thanks!"

t3_1ft8jbv,Move or Stay After Age 70,"My partner and I are both retired and have lived in our current home in central Texas since 1986 - new build (partner purchased the home two months before we met).  House is a two story in a fully developed area with no HOA and is in great shape with upgrades over the years.  As a plus we back up to a city park green belt with large oak trees just beyond our fence.  

My dilemma is should we stay here or move to a +55 community about 45 minutes from our current home?   The amenities are outstanding with over 100 clubs, golf, tennis, pools, woodshop, etc.   

Downside to staying is the second story, no amenities, all of our long term friends have either moved or passed away, we are the only house on the street with no children, and now that we have retired we spend way too much time driving to and from the gym and other places for entertainment.  

 Our main concern with moving to the +55 community is they have a very strict HOA that costs $140 per month, after a few visits for a formal tour and open houses the atmosphere seems a bit more conservative than we are used to, after +30 years in one spot we are not looking forward to the selling - buying - moving process, we both feel like first-time home buyers, and while most everything will be within a 10 minute drive that shrink may reduce our world too much.

Financially we are OK as we have always lived lower than our means and invested well.  That being said, we are not the landlord type and if we do this we will sell our current place and buy the new place for cash.  After doing a conservative estimate we will have money left over from the sale without disrupting our investments or cash flow.  

Look forward to feedback from others who made similar decisions and RE professionals who have worked with folks like us."

How do I un-do it without triggering a property tax re-assessment? Do I need to take it out of the trust and wait for 2 years before I can sell it and get that benefit? This is very confusing to me. I was trying to do the right thing and did an estate planning, and put my house in the trust, but now that I want to downsize, what is the best thing to do? Thank you! "

t3_1ft6vfq,Survey discrepancies ,Hi - we just bought a house. We noticed on the survey that it said our fence we share with a neighbor is 7 ft on our property. He is holding a survey that says it’s 3 ft. The fence is pretty long and he wants to replace a portion of it asap. I’m in no rush and was eventually planning on getting a topographical survey for some other work we’re doing but that’s still a couple grand and we aren’t ready to start on that work.

t3_1ftdyl5,How to determine sq footage for listing purposes?,"So our home was listed at ~3100 sq ft. That includes the finished basement, which is 1100sq ft by itself. That means the top two floors are roughly 2k sq ft. When looking for a new home, I noticed the listings only mentioned the area on the top two floors and never factor in the finished basement. What I'm curious about is I understand cost per sq footage is important so why would my house list include all 3 floors but these other homes do not?

Edit:

But more context that I forgot to add. What's considered below grade? Our basement is a walkout, from the front you can't tell this but from the back it looks like a three story home.

My mention of listed it's the what's on the main page right by the price of the house. I've seen listing where it breaks down below grade and above grade. Mine just happens to have total. When I look at other homes, the SQ ft listed by the price is typically above grade. You expand the listing and it does show a separate line item for below grade."

t3_1ft4grn,Dead Grandma's House in California,"So, I am writing this as kind of a last-ditch effort. I feel like I know what I need to do, but I feel like the good people of Reddit might be able to help me a little bit more so that I am best prepared when I reach out to a real estate attorney.

 

My wife and I have been living in a home in California since 2017. The home is in the name of her deceased grandmother who passed in 2016. We have been paying the mortgage in cash every month and have never missed a payment. There is a living grandfather, the home was owned sole and separate from him. There was a will leaving the home my wife’s mother, the only child of said grandparents, who had deceased prior to grandmother dying. Wife is also an only child. There is also an estranged sister of the grandmother somewhere in Pennsylvania somewhere? No party wants anything to do with the house and believe that the house belongs to my wife.

 

When my wife’s grandmother passed, it was her understanding that the home would need to go through probate, and the process would be expensive. She didn’t have the money or the connection to the house to want to keep it; she wanted to use it and walk away from it when she was done, a decision that I have never agreed with. We got married earlier this year and have lived in this house almost the whole time that we have been together with the permission of the executor, a family friend. (I include this tidbit bc of the possibility that someone bring up adverse possession)

 

The home has become somewhat dilapidated over time. Needs a new roof, the HVAC just went out, the flooring is falling apart and is becoming less and less livable. We do not want to invest in fixing this home up if we will not be getting a return on that investment. As we get closer to purchasing a home of our own, the equity that we have been building over time in the home, dilapidated or not, looks more and more appealing to him. We are just against the clock and are not liquid for that much cash (our biggest barrier atm).

 

We want to purchase a home now and we are feeling the pressure of this home falling apart around us. We cannot carry two mortgages if we must go through the probate process, which we understand takes an average of 18 months. I wanted to see if anyone out there with a better understanding of Prop 19 and the changes since 2017 might be able to shed some light on our situation.

 

TLDR: Is there a way to avoid probate of dead grandma’s house?"
t3_1ft4a60,Advice on a money issue,"My wife and I have decided that it's time to downsize before we retire.  We will take the equity from our home sale and pay cash for our new home.  We are also throwing around the idea of borrowing an additional $100,000 so we can get some features in our new home that we can't live without.

My dilemma is how to time it and what to do.  I've bought and sold homes before.  The difference is that an employer was paying for the move and helping out on the closing and new purchase.  This time, it's all on us.

I'll put my home up for sale but, I won't know when it will sell.  I really can't commit to buying a home until I have cash in hand.   Say, for example, we sell the house and close on November 1.  We will be out of our old home.  We will not have a new home yet because we need the proceeds from the old house to help pay for the new one.

Ideally, we will have a home picked out and will close within a month or so of our commitment.  However, we are also looking at new builds.  Builders are talking about 1 year to get in a new home.

Finally, to my question. What do I do for that time while waiting to close on our new home?  Do I have to put our stuff in storage and get an apartment temporarily? That scenario will be an extra expense.  Quite a large expense. Plus the wear and tear of moving my stuff twice.

Is there any way to get a temp loan so we can have the new home already purchased?  I know this is a risk because there is no guarantee when my current home will sell.  Also, making two payments each month could easily put us beyond our ability to pay.  Also, two water, gas, electricity, property tax, insurance payments for two homes will add up.

I'm hoping that the professionals on this sub can make some suggestions.

In case it matters, I'm hoping to sell my old house for about $850,000 and use the equity to buy about a $500,000 home with either cash or taking out the aforementioned $100 K loan.  We are in Texas and, in DFW.  We are looking to buy in the next town over, less than 10 miles, so at least moving expenses won't be super high. It seems like prices have not settled down.  I'm seeing houses in our range selling from around $180 Sq. Ft., to about $330. Sq Ft.  I know that there are lots of other factors that cause that difference.  I just thought I'd throw that in, in case it is a factor.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I will appreciate any suggestions.

t3_1ft478p,National MLS Time? ,"Does anyone out there think that a national mls and national forms will come out of all the miscommunication in the industry to streamline it? 

I’m just curious what others think. What do you think would be good about no local MLS’s and a national one? What do you think would be bad about it? Do you think it would help the public or hurt the public? 

Same with national forms, contracts, etc. Do you think those would help promote transparency or hinder it? 

Are your local boards helpful or wasteful? Are your state forms worse than other states or better? Do you think if the states that triggered the lawsuit had more transparent contracts like other states that the lawsuit may have never happened? 

I’m just curious. On one hand, I think one national mls would be great and on another, I think we would still need local parties to communicate up the chain to them on our behalf. 

As far as national forms and contracts go, I think it could be great and it could be not so great. The opinions of others will help me decide.

t3_1ft466v,Roof help! Getting insured? ,"
Hi! So I posted a week ago that we were under contract for a house in NC and the property has a backup offer. Home inspection came back to recommend a roofer come out to evaluate given the aged and deteriorating shingles. Roofer comes out and does inspection with pictures (in the link provided) and gives his evaluation.

“It is our opinion that the roof is at the end of its lifecycle. The age and wear on the roof is most evident by the granule loss on the shingles. You will see several photo's where you see dark patches on the shingles. This is where the granules have been stripped away and the black asphalt matt of the shingle itself is visible - that means there is little weather protection left on that shingle. There are instances of both hail damage (seen of soft metals) and wind damage. The wind damage is visible in the lines on the roof. This is from tree damage and where the shingles have been lifted (and they creased).

There have been previous repairs made to the roof - you can see previous patches and there are numerous instances where pipe boots, chimney flashings and nail pops have been caulked - but these are usually temporary fixes at best.  Our opinion is that there may be 1-2 years left on this roof before serious issues may occur.”

Roofer is concerned that we may be unable to get the house insured, or that insurance may drop us if they end up doing additional inspection/more thorough appraisal. We don’t know roof age and sellers don’t either. 

Our RE agent says that sellers are getting a divorce and not keen to do repairs. Apparently they aren’t even on talking terms and have split the DD fees individually lol. They have a backup offer. We put down a 5k due diligence fee which we have to forfeit if we walk away (because North Carolina….)

I’m just wondering how can we go around this? Anyone has experiences with being unable to get insurance due to age/condition of roof prior to closing? Could you share your experiences? 

We don’t expect a new roof, but we’re hoping for some concessions. The property is in a highly sought after area in a pretty hot market and also a good price point. We offered 5k over list to get under contract. 

Thanks in advance!!

1. Yield curve just uninverted. Typically a recession follows in some capacity. Especially when a rate cut follows (as it did). 

2. Sahm rule (unemployment recession indicator) just flashed red.

3. Car repossessions are on a significant rise. Foreclosures are too but not as significantly.

4. I’m in the top 80% median household income for my area (nothing special ~169,000 pre-tax) and have consistently been priced out of what I consider to be relatively terrible houses with major issues. I’m not afraid of fixing something up and it’s what I’ve been looking for.

5. 4/5 of every house I look at in the $230,000-$450,000 is dropping 15-30k per week it seems. 

TLDR: Recession imminent? Prices are falling in my area.

t3_1ft14xd,[Florida] Section 8 tenant suing for Security Deposit for Early Termination Fee,"Florida

A Section 8 tenant requested to break her lease after only 4 months, so we signed a Mutual Rescission Agreement provided by Section 8. There is an Early Termination Fee of 2 months’ rent, so her entire security deposit is being withheld. The Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit was sent by certified mail and is being returned, but I also sent it by email. 

The Mutual Rescission Agreement states “We mutually agree to rescind the Housing Assistance Payment Contract, Lease and Lease Addendum to the Lease currently in effect for the residence located at… The effective date of this recession will be August 31, 2024. After which, the Housing Assistance Payments Contract is void and the tenant is responsible for the entire rent. 

Further, I, (tenant), agree to make full restitution to (landlord) for damages and/or unpaid rent. I understand that failing to comply with this agreement could result in forfeiture of my Housing Assistance from Orange County’s Section 8 Programs.” 

She doesn’t think she has to pay the Early Termination Fee and is demanding her security deposit back. This is her latest email reply: 
“You’ve already stated there’s no damages the apartment was left in great condition. We both mutually agreed to the termination. I did consult with a lawyer . I’m prepared to move forward . Any/ all legal fee &amp; court fee’s will be included in the law suit .” 

Did I do anything wrong or am I missing something here? Does she actually have a case? I can’t imagine a lawyer will say that the Mutual Rescission Agreement voids the Early Termination Fee Addendum that was signed in the beginning of the lease. 

I’m wondering whether the last paragraph of the Mutual Rescission Agreement would cover the Early Termination Fee/Liquidated Damages addendum that she signed with the original lease."

I won't make this mistake again. 

-------

Did I already mess this up!? My partner and I recently started casually home shopping. We stopped by an open house, didn't like the house but did like the realtor and gave her our contact info.

She sent us some listings, we toured a few, then she mentioned ""Oh and my company needs this contract signed."" 

Now, we bought a home 5 years ago and because we were just casually looking I didn't think too deeply about it and signed because last time the seller paid our agent's fees. I was clueless about the NAR ruling.

The contract said she gets paid 3%. We happened to see a home we loved at the high end of our budget and now I am totally panicking. When we initially started looking earlier this month I didn't realize we would be on the hook for this much extra.

Both I (the seller), the buyer, and the escrow officer signed these documents.
Now, after the sale has closed, the title company is claiming we owe $1,000 for title insurance instead of the agreed $75. They're saying they can change this amount because of the Errors and Omissions Compliance Agreement we signed. (Typed below) However, this unexpected charge brings us below the profit threshold we needed to make the sale of the house worthwhile.
Is this legal? Can they change the cost after closing despite what was listed and signed? We had a signed agreement, and this large discrepancy is significantly affecting our financial outcome.

t3_1fsxw80,Sell vs Rent? ,"Reading over other post here regarding this question, I see each person's situation is unique and I need to ask from my own person perspective. 

I own (no mortgage) a 2 bedroom 3 bath house in a pretty remote part of Arkansas, more of small retirement area, not much work there. 

I bought another condo a while back and put this house on the market (Feb 2024) and have only gotten low ball offers and even the one I accepted backed out. I am so tired of dealing with this and am thinking of leasing it.

My concern is of course the headache of leasing when I live 4 hours away. I guess I can hire a lease management company? Since I don't owe anything on it, I haven't got a mortgage to consider, the going rate in the area for a place my size is at least 1000.00 a month. HOA fees are going up to 216.00 a month, which I absolutely get NOTHING for. When I bought this place it was 106.00 a month. 

I see others say I would lose my homestead rate on taxes, which would then be about 460.00 a year.....and I wonder if I would have to pay higher homeowners insurance since it's a rental? I have a few months left on the contract with realtor, and need to do a couple improvements to rent it out. I learned when the other guy backed out after inspection, I have a new issue I need to get repaired. But that is happening no matter what, now that I know about. I don't need the money from the sale and wonder if I can make a profit off of renting? I have no idea what to do, I am a single 74 year old woman and I am not up to dealing with all of this, I never dreamed it would take me this long to sell my house. Am I being too inpatient?

What are some daily tasks I could be doing to educate myself?

Is this a good business to get into even in this market?

Will anyone take me serious at 18?

Im kind of having second thoughts so any advice or literally anything would be greatly appreciated

t3_1fsx2fv,Orange County Home Buyer - Buyer’s Agent or No?,"Td;dr:
1. Buyer’s agent necessary?
2. Correct to think about offer as 103% of our offer if we don’t use one?
3. OC attorney / title rec?
4. If we use a buyer’s agent, what % on a $1.7-2.0M home?

We know who we would use if we were to use a buyer’s agent - a realtor that helped us negotiate the lease for our current rental home for no charge.

Question is, do we really need a buyer’s agent or should we put an offer in without one clearly stipulating the buyer’s agent portion should be credited back to the seller? So a $2,000,000 offer, which would be $1,880,000 net to the seller assuming 3%/3% seller/buyer agent, would actually be $1,940,000. Can someone please tell me if I’m thinking about this correctly?

Finally, any recommendations around whether we should use a buyer’s agent? I am in real estate private equity and my job is to negotiate things, and I’m a previously-licensed real estate agent from another state (though admittedly I worked almost entirely on rentals, owned a brokerage shop in college). Can I get away with just having a good real estate attorney / title company? If so, bonus points for any recommendations in Orange County. 

Final Q, with this NAR settlement, what WOULD be the appropriate % to offer a buyer’s agent if we opted to use? $1.7-2.0M home. Thanks in advance for the wisdom. "
t3_1fswrur,long term capital gains tax question - probably been asked before,"I'm sure this has been asked before, but I have a tax question.

If I am single and realize a 600K profit from selling my primary residence that I have lived in for 10 years, I see that I am taxed on 350K (250K is exempt, apparently).  


So 350K is taxable (yikes).



I found a table that shows 0% 15% or 20% depending on my gross income.



If my gross income is 160K, do I have to add the 350K for taxable income 510K and putting me in 20% range (492k and higher) or is it only the 160K putting me in the 15% range n (44.6k to 492K)?



tl: dr - does the house profit get added to gross income to put me into one of the brackets, or is it only my income.

thanks."
t3_1fswmd3,Question regarding pre existing fence,"So I have owned my house for about 10 years now and at the back of my yard there’s a vacant lot that’s never been developed. We have a chain link fence that was probably installed at least 5-10 years before we bought the house. The property owner next door decided to have a survey done and supposedly  a corner of the fence is about 5’ onto their property. To give a visual it would form an obtuse triangle where the center point would be about 5’ deep but I gut doesn’t really matter. 

My question is do I have any legal recourse considering I didn’t put the fence up and it’s been there for 15-20 years? I know every state may be different (I’m in WV). He’s not asking me to move it but wants me to sign something stating I know about it and then if whomever buys the property would know the situation. "
t3_1ft7y3i,Seller agent and lawyer lied on transaction— recourse?,"I was working with my business partner to buy a rural property, and the seller’s attorney informed us this morning that the seller does not want to proceed with the transaction. There was no reason provided and no opportunity to counter with a different offer.

This is after the seller’s attorney, sent us a contract with wrong information, which my lawyers office had to send amendment to last Tuesday. She ignored our messages, and did not proceed with getting a corrected contract to us. The real estate agent on the transaction ignored our agent for days, and won’t even take our calls now. We feel EXTREMELY UPSET. The attorney even admitted that she knew LAST WEEK that the seller did not want to proceed, but kept that information.

We understand that the seller does not have to sell to us just because he accepted our offer. However, we feel that the behavior of the attorney and agent were in extremely bad faith— sending an incorrect contract, not correcting it, stalling us over the weekend while she knew that the seller did not want to sell to us, and then not offering any reason or opportunity to counter.

I would like to explore what legal recourse we might have in a case like this. I live 1.5 hours from the area, and took off work several times  to drive up. So did my contractor, who was pricing out our renovation. My business partner had to travel from far away to complete this transaction. We paid our lawyer a deposit to do business. We feel cheated and want to know what legal recourse can be pursued via a civil suit. Does anyone have any ideas? "

t3_1fsrmop,Rent or Buy,"I'm selling my current home to move to a bigger one and closer to family. However, I am torn between renting or buying the next one. It's a but of a unique situation.

There is a medium likelihood I'd need to move again 2-3y from now. There is a HIGH likelihood 4-5y. After 5y, likely staying in the home for a total of 15y. This is due to a job situation completely out of my control.

From all the areas I've looked at, rent or buy calculators are telling me 4-6y needed for buying to be cheaper.

Here's the part that makes it even trickier, I own a rental house, but I have a property manager. If I were to buy, it'd be with the intent to rent it after I move. However, I don't think I could justify a property manager in some cases. And I've never managed a property from out of state.

Additional details:
- 140k down-payment
- looking at 320-400k range.
- 2 cats

t3_1fsri5h,"Help, do we continue to rent large home or downgrade to buy in Maryland ","[MD] my husband (31M) and I (30F) currently rent in Edgewater, Maryland. We have a great deal on rent 1,900 sq. ft., 3 bed/2.5 bath for $2,300/month. Landlords are great and we love the area. 

The rental home is nice with a fenced in yard. There are things we’d like to change and we also wonder if we should be investing by buying. 

My husband is starting a handyman business and having a garage or shed for tools and working on projects would be very beneficial.

Our current rental has 3 stories and stairs to get outside from every door. Our dog is getting older. He’s stumbled up/down the stairs a couple of times and it breaks our hearts. I WFH most days and he is my shadow. 

The problem is, to buy a house in a similar (slightly less expensive area) like Pasadena, we would have to significantly downgrade space and home quality. We found a home 900 sq. ft. And built in 1930, 2 bed/1 bath but great, but it has a nice fenced in yard, a garage for him to work in and a shed for extra storage. That mortgage would be the same as staying in our current rental (assuming that price doesn’t go up). 

My husband has worked on houses most of his life and could make upgrades to a fixer upper. 

What do we do? Is it worth downsizing and hitting potentially large fixes to own a home? 

EDIT: the home for sale is an incredible deal for the condition and location of the home. We haven't found anything like it in the year we've been looking. It's one of the best case scenarios for our budget. Maryland has ridiculously expensive housing (especially where I work close to DC). Listed less than 24 hours and had two offers. So we know it is a lucky find. Offer deadline today.

EDIT2: We made a competitive offer on the house, but it was not selected. They accepted a cash offer instead. Thanks for all the advice and support. "
t3_1fsri1v,"Tired of being poor, need some breathing room, renting sucks!","First of all, a little venting.... it's ridiculous that half of my monthly income, 2 weeks out of the month of the work I do (substance abuse counselor with a bachelor's degree), my entire second paycheck (i get paid biweekly) goes to rent. $1220.00 for a 1 bedroom apartment, no amenities like a pool or a gym or a playground, unless you count the small retention pond as lake front 🤔.  I'm just tired of living part check to pay check and still not being able to get everything we need throughout the month, I have a 1 year old, so diapers etc are a necessity just as much as food is, which we're able to get about $50 in groceries a week, which isn't much but we make it stretch. My family helps out allot with diapers, gas, etc when we need it, so I'm blessed! Anyways, I'm just wanting to help us get ahead a little bit, but renting is ridiculous right now unless I move to the ghetto, which i prefer not to bring my baby up in that environment. So, I calculated that if I get a loan for a down payment on a house (mobile home) and have about a $500/month mortgage payment, it will equal out to being less than I currently pay for rent. I've read other posts with comments saying ""don't do it"", but if it's less than what I'm currently paying, why the heck not?"
t3_1fsugxg,how/where do I start?!!,"Is there a site, book, podcast, journal, etc. that has an ""explain it like I’m 5"" approach guide to real estate investing? I know snippets of how it all works, but would love to find a well laid-out explanation of how to start for a complete beginner. Also considering a mentorship.

For some details;

-I have a year of 100% free time to learn (and then part time after) and ideally would like to be in the industry and making a bit of income within a few months. 

-I’m willing to put $10,000 (cad) in at first, which is the majority of my savings.

-I have high school diploma and nothing else (having graduated this June).

I’m Canadian, living in France for the next 3-5 years (at least) and willing to travel within EU. 

I have the ability to work online or around my city and surrounding areas. I cannot have formal meetings with many locals as my native language is English and I cannot communicate well enough in French to sound professional. Also, I look young for my age and I feel like this puts me below others when working in-person.

How can I start? 

Ideally I’d like to put a down payment on a small affordable condo (there is potential assistance from family if I have a legit plan), gently refurbish, use my marketing skills to advertise as an Airbnb (using socials to promote) and use this as monthly income while managing from afar. This money would go directly into paying off the condo, and then I would hope it sell it once the value rises after 4 years or so, splitting the cost to put down payments on 2 different condos. Repeat the process but x2, once paid off, keep one and split the other as down before. Is this feasible? "

t3_1fs6obh,Would you rather?,"My Dad will be selling his house soon. It's a 1920s craftsman, really well taken care of. Roof is good, new siding, original woodwork, custom kitchen and bathroom etc. He'll likely get around 600k for it.

He does have asbestos in the basement and knob and tube. Don't ask me why he's never done anything about it in 33 years.

Would you rather pay a little less for the house in accounting for these issues? Or would you rather pay more for the house with all of these issues addressed already?


Edit: Thanks for all the feedback. I'll encourage him to talk to some realtors, and get some quotes. 

Concensus, not dealing with it will limit the buyers and the price. Dealing with it wouldn't guarantee a return on investment either. Both, not too surprising. 

I think he is just old, really doesn't want more projects and wouldn't care if he got less for it. "

t3_1fsov7s,Investment ,Can you invest into property with only $10k? 
t3_1fsnidk,Feeling overwhelmed - Process of turning basement into additional unit (commercial)?,"I own a 4 unit, mixed use building. Its 2 residential units (top floor), 2 commercial units (ground floor). The building also has a walk-out basement that is fully finished (2 entrances/exits), but unoccupied. The building was built in the 1930s. I am very confused about how to go about turning the basement unit into another legally rentable commercial unit for the building?

  
Where do I even begin?

  
Areas of confusion are; 



certificate of occupancy. This CofO, its issued for the entire building, not for each individual units in the building? If thats the case, to add another ""unit"" to the building I would need to get a new CofO that specifies the basement as an additional unit suitable for occupancy? Is this a correct undestanding? OR do I pursue a seperate CofO just for the basement unit itself?

  
Building code, fire code, and grandfathering. The basement, for the most part, meets the current (2024) building code requirements for minimum ceiling height. However it has beams, ducts, and pipes, that at specific points reduce the ceiling height to below the current building code requirements. However, the building was built back in the 1930s and code then was much different than now obviously. Does this mean these code ""violations"" are likely just grandfathered in and therefore not an issue UNLESS we were to completely rennovate the basement (which we will not do as its already in great condition).

  
How do I know if i can have this basement unit become a ""legally"" rentable commercial unit for my building? What is the step by step process for making this happen? Assuming no intention of doing any rennovations as the unit is already in suitable finished condition. How do I determine what aspects of building/fire code would the unit absolutely have to comply with? Should I hire an independent commercial inspector to come in and tell me what things would need to be brought up to code? OR, should I instead have the city itself send an inspector and have him tell me what needs to be brought up to code to get a CofO issued for the unit?

  
Sorry if I seem all over the place here, just struggling to understand the process and would appreciate anyone with insight on this to give me a step-by-step process of how I move forward with figuring this out."
t3_1fsmztw,As-is sale by a trust?,"I am looking at houses in Bergen County, NJ and I found a fairly new house(built around 2003) that I like for relatively low price. I was considering putting in an offer but then I saw the following in the NJMLS fact sheet that they give out at the open house:

""As-is Sale. The owner is a trust and subject to court approval. The trust admin....has little to no knowledge of the property. Pool condition/equipment unknown. Buyer to get all town approvals"".

Unfortunately, I didn't notice this comment at the OH so I couldn't ask the listing agent(but not sure if they  would even give a straight explanation). The pool itself appeared to not have been opened this past summer.

Can anyone help explain what this means and if it's a red-flag that I need to look out for as a buyer? I think I understand the ""as-is"" part but confused by the ""trust"" &amp; ""court approval"" and ""town approvals"" bits."
t3_1frb54m,After I signed on a home my realtor said the sellers ex wife won’t sign😮😞,"I negotiated, I paid for appraisals and inspections, they cleaned everything out, I did a final walk through. I signed all the forms. The title company even took my picture with a big dumb key in my hand.


My realtor called me up : hours later and said don’t move in the ex wife won’t sign the necessary forms to sell . She’s not on the deed. It’s just a divorce decree that says she’s entitled to half the profits. 

The story is that she cheated on her husband and then let her friends live in the house for free. Her friend’s trashed the place which devalued the house enough to where there is no profit. The husband is the only one on the deed. He gets sick of everything and just sells it for what ever he owes probably so he could just mess with her friends? I don’t know? It appraised at a low value 

So she walks into the title company and they give her paperwork to sign off on. She says , “how much do I get” they say, “nothing” . She walks out.

I get no house. What the hell? 

Her name is in a divorce decree not the home so why does she have to sign anything ? 

 I told my kids we have a home.  What Am I gonna say to them now?

t3_1fskx4s,Closing tomorrow but buyer is not clear to close yet,"I am the seller and we are supposed to close tomorrow, but we just found out on Friday that the buyer still needs to translate a document for the lender, so they are still not cleared to close yet. We are scheduled to sign with Title at 9am and they are still scheduled to sign at 4pm, I'm assuming to give them time to get the loan approved. I am so frustrated because we have been waiting to close for over a month and this is incredibly last minute. I truly don't know who is at fault here. Even title was asking them to just extend the date, but the buyer does not want to. The lender keeps saying that we will still close on time, but as time goes on, I have so many doubts. The buyer is also apparently saying that he can't close any other day because he has a flight to catch tomorrow night (day of closing) and will be gone for 3 weeks for work. Everything has been incredibly frustrating.

I guess to any realtors/LO/underwriters, do you really think we are actually closing tomorrow??"
t3_1fskp5m,How did I do? Be brutally honest ,"Let me preface this by saying I’m a total newbie  so there will probably be some wtf moments. I just want to learn more and get it from a experienced persons POV. I want to be able to teach my kid about this stuff later on. 

Brand new development by medium sized builder. Joined their early bird list and went to their open house. They registered me as soon as I walked in. If I wanted to use my own realtor, should he/she been there with me at that first open house? Also, early bird special is first two buyers get a free basement room, valued at 20k. 

Fast forward a week and we are now at our one on one appointment with the sales rep on Monday. We go thru lot selection and sales rep crosses out 2 lots and I’m thinking ‘no more free rec room…great’ BUT sales rep surprises us and says management is willing to give out one more (looking back, I’m thinking all the early buyers got it, what do you think?) 
Anyways, build the house together and come up with a price(we pretty much maxed out the house sq-ft wise i.e. finished basement, bigger kitchen) We try to negotiate the price but to no avail. We say yes and leave. 

Sales rep sends email that night with written contract and wants to schedule signing the next day. I’m shittin my pants. Being a newbie, I did not know it would move this fast, we weren’t even sure if we wanted everything we added. I email my honest feelings about not being ready to sign due to price. I continue to negotiate price over the next couple days resulting in sales rep giving me 10k off sales price. I counter with 20k. Ultimately, sales rep says that would be an offer from me, but given my strong credit and assets, it will more than likely get approved as long we sign on Friday. 
(At this point I already talked to the preferred lender and sent all docs in regard to loan pre-approval. Im guessing loan officer talked to sales rep)

After hearing this, we go sign on Thursday. 
(This is giving me anxiety because this feels like a wink wink deal that has not been officially approved by management. Sales rep keeps reassuring me that it will go thru due to the strong relationship that the manager has with the ultimate decision maker on this. Any chance I get screwed on this?)

(Also, sales rep wrote and sent contract on Monday night, is that considered first day of contract, even though I did not sign until Thrusday? I thought Thursday would be considered first day) 

Ultimately, that will be 40k off price if everything goes smoothly. 
What are the chances of doing better than that? 
Was I out of line anywhere in this process? 
What would you have done differently?
How did I do?

Next thing is design center, will I be able to negotiate price there? If so, tips and tricks please!

THANK YOU to the people who take the time to read this and give thoughtful, honest feedback."

t3_1fsdifz,Where to invest inherited money?,"Background: I am a 24 yr old, and like the title suggests I recently inherited some money that was set aside in a custodial account. Now that I am an independent and over 18 I have sole ownership of the account. The balance is around $260,000. As you can imagine this is a large amount for someone at my age. Immediately I invested all of it in a couple of blue chip stocks and planned on forgetting about the account and live within my means of what I earn currently(about $30,000/yr). I was always taught to save as much as you can so why would this be any different?

My request for advice is I am looking into moving soon and, instead of renting, buy a house. Based on my current earnings and my personal savings account (about $30,000 in my personal acc.) I can afford a mortgage on a house worth about $130k(760 credit score). I know I can’t find a house worth living in for that much in this current housing market. Ideally I would like a house around the $200k mark to be able to fix up and flip. I am heavily considering a duplex and renting out half while I live in the other and remodeling both sides over time. My question is how much should I dig into my inherited account and while still being about to afford a mortgage? I could just buy a house will all cash but then I wont have much money in the stock market and have most of my assets in the housing market. They both appreciate but what one is better?"
t3_1fsddy1,Classes,Do anybody know a good real estate class I can tend to?
t3_1frewgd,An experience in Texas this week with new rules,"Saw a listing for a lakehouse on Zillow. Called the LISTING agent.   I’m an attorney and I’ve done more real estate closings than most realtors, so I did not want or need a buyer’s agent. However, I retired last year and I had not kept up with the rule changes. 

Anyway, when I called the LISTING agent, I was called back by an associate in the listing agent’s office who started talking to me about the property. I assume I’m dealing with the person I’ll be negotiating against. Then he offers to be my agent. 

Dual agency is illegal in Texas, but the workaround is that a brokerage can have one agent act as a seller’s agent and one act as a buyer’s agent. It’s still usually a stupid idea rife with conflicts that makes the industry look terrible, but again, I (incorrectly) assumed I wasn’t paying this guy directly, I was already fine with the asking price, and I can look out for myself. I figured at least he had a quick line of communication to the seller’s agent since she probably signs his paychecks. 

“My” agent had no idea what he was doing, but I didn’t care - he got me in to see the property. He did not have me sign any agreement before that happened, which is apparently against the new rules. 

So I informed him I wanted to offer full asking price, and I told him it would be a cash deal. No contingencies for financing. 

He tried to talk me out of offering full asking, and he eventually succeeded. But 20 minutes after I leave the property, he tells me there has been another offer. Again, I’ve signed no agreement with him, I’ve made no formal offer. He says the offer is $2k under asking, so maybe I should offer full asking. 

I honestly assumed this was a lie that his boss (ie, the seller’s agent) told him to tell me, but since I’d wanted to offer full asking anyway, I told him to draw it up. 

Then he sends me his buyer’s agreement and that’s when I got up to speed on the new rules. 

What it said was that I would be responsible for paying 3%, but he assured me that really he was getting 2% from the seller’s agent (ie, his boss, lol). And I’d only be paying 1% cash. 

I told him if that’s the case, let’s put that in writing, and I drafted a provision that would allow him to get 3% but only obligated me to 1%. 

Obviously, at this point I’m irritated. I wanted to deal with the seller’s agent directly and I have this dumbass in the way. And now I have to pay him just to get an offer drawn up. But I’m in a conference all week, it was time sensitive, and against my better judgment, I signed the buyer’s agreement. 

Then he sent me the contract offer to sign. It had a million mistakes and omitted information, so I fixed those documents and signed them. My wife (co-buyer) had NOT signed them yet when I get a call from “my” agent who now informs me that there is a better offer. 

Ok, so before my offer is even signed by my wife, he’s telling me that somebody else has offered a better deal than full asking for cash. Why would somebody do that unless (a) he informed them about my offer which wasn’t even an offer yet; or (b) he’s just lying to get me into a bidding war with myself to drive the price up so that the broker gets a larger pie to slice up. 

This is when I told him I was not comfortable - he had conflicts, I didn’t feel like he was on my team, and I’d only deal with the seller’s agent directly. 

He sent me a document to terminate the buyer’s agreement and the deal is dead, because the seller’s agent won’t call me back. 

So I’m just posting for thoughts. If everything that happened here is totally normal and cool, then the real estate industry is more messed up than ever in my opinion. "

t3_1fs7wp8,Walk through before closing of a furnished home?,"I close on a house tomorrow and my realtor wants to do a walk through today. However, they are doing a lease back for another month. So all of the furniture and wall decor are still in the home. 

I asked what happens if I find damage after they actually move out, and I don’t think I have any recourse. 

Is this common in leaseback situations? What’s the point of the walk through while it’s still furnished?"
t3_1frt23g,"First time home buyer, inspections weren't good","It's a house built in 1970 and it has the kind of problems you'd expect. 

Major issues include a failing sewer pipe that couldn't be inspected all the way to the street because of roots, termites and dry rot in fascia and some corvals on the exterior, an installation error on the fireplace that's creating a fire hazard, and a leak in the garage. The general home inspector also noted some aluminum wiring that wasn't installed correctly that's convinced me it needs an electrical inspection too. 

All told before I've had an electrical inspection, I've been quoted $18k for repairs. Given I know there's at least some aluminum wiring, I expect that number to go higher. Despite all this the inspectors were generally very positive for a house this old.

We absolutely love the house and the property, but this is intimidating. My realtor is suggesting that we ask them to either cover closing costs or reduce the sale price of the home so that we don't need to risk the current owner making the cheapest possible repairs. I'm inclined to agree, and I guess here's the part where I'm asking for advice. Covering closing costs seems wise since that leaves us with cash in hand to address these problems ourselves, but is this too much to take on for a first time home buyer?

Update:

Huge thanks to everyone that replied, you folks have really helped to shape the conversations I've been having with my realtor and given me confidence (and some reasonable doubts) about moving forward on this house.

Well, we're doing it. I just got through with an electrical inspection where we walked through all of the issues that the general inspector noted and then some. The short version is that it does have aluminum wiring throughout and the aluminum is incorrectly spliced with copper, both at the breaker box and behind every outlet. There are a few areas where it's clear that new wiring was added as copper as well, so that needs to be chased down and addressed at the point where the splice occurs. 

Good news: we have a plan to address the fire hazards and bring it to a livable standard. He had other recommendations to make as well, up to and including a rewire, but just to address the safety hazards he put is in the ballpark of $3500. He's going to get back to us with an actual quote but that was based on a house nearby that was the same size where he just completed the same exact job. I trust the guy; I know him by reputation and he's gotten a really strong recommendation from someone I trust who has worked with him in the past.

I'm not taking a rewire off the table, it's definitely something that I intend to address in the time that we're living there, but it's no longer got me worrying about whether we'll be able to close on the house burning down.

Thanks again everyone!"

We found that home in southwest Austin and for the past three years have steadily worked on it during the occasional weekend and free afternoon.

One project at a time, we’ve tried to transform the home from a neglected place into a warm and beautiful one. I painted the entire exterior this past spring. We ripped up an old (trip-hazard-prone) sidewalk leading to the door and replaced it with a modern walkway. We replaced the ugly boxy bushes and with a wide variety of plants. Not to mention, most of the updates have been indoors: paint, new bathrooms and kitchen, etc. It's been a lot of work.

Well, this morning the anonymous note appeared on our door.

t3_1frg0de,"Bank appraisal came back substantially lower, what to expect?","Backstory. Buying a home. Beautiful home and property, newer, well maintained, no problems, 15 acres, a pond, new barn, but rural in the middle of nowhere. Originally the sellers listed for 700k, but it was on the market for 5 months with no bites. They lowered the asking price to 600k, still no bites, until we came along. 

We didn't care that it was so rural away from everything, but our agent felt it was still a bit overvalued, so we offered 550k, which seems completely fair, because if you moved this house and property only 10 miles closer to civilization, you'd be paying this or double. The sellers weren't happy at that price, but they accepted because they are motivated to sell (they built a new house they are moving to and need this one sold).

We are putting $125k down on the mortgage, so we will have roughly a $425k mortgage.

Anyway, bank appraisal came back, and they value the house at only $350k, $200k less than the offer price. The reason being because two factors:

1. The rural nature of the home, the appraiser can't really find any comparables nearby. There were only 3 other homes that sold in the last 13 months within the radius, and only 1 was similar in bedrooms and baths and square footage, but in our opinion was a run down dump.

2. The home we are buying has a separate inlaw apartment about 1000SF with a full bath and bedroom, but because it doesn't have a stove or hookup for a stove, the appraiser is not considering this living space and not factoring it into the total square footage like the sellers did on the MLS listing.


Has anyone else run into this before?

Our agent says this can work in our favor because we could now offer them far less for the home, but I'm worried they won't bite and might back out. They are motivated to sell, but already weren't too happy they were getting 150k less than what they originally wanted."
t3_1fs7don,What is the real value of the guest house?,"My husband and I got divorced about four years ago, and we have a unique living situation. We live in Florida on a property with two houses: the main house and a detached guest house. It’s important to note that the property is assessed as a whole, based on the entire 1 acre of land, rather than evaluating each house separately.

Since we have one child together, we agreed in our divorce settlement that I would stay in the guest house so I could be close and regularly see my daughter. However, I’ve actually been living in the main house with my ex-husband (I rent a room there for a low cost) and renting out the guest house for $2,300 a month, which covers more than my living expenses. I believe part of a home’s value comes from the income it generates.

About a year ago, my ex-husband started pressuring me to give him half of the rental income from the guest house, even though it was well after our divorce settlement. I eventually agreed, and we modified the divorce agreement.

Now, he wants to buy out my share of the property for a very low price of $52,000. Given the rental income, that amount feels insignificant—I could earn that much in just a couple of years. Plus, in the last three years, I’ve replaced all the appliances, the roof, A/C, septic system, and fence.

A recent appraisal of the entire property came in at $657,000. My ex-husband hired an appraiser to evaluate the guest house, but the appraiser only looked at comparable properties nearby instead of assessing its actual value.

Now my ex is threatening to sell the whole property if I don’t agree to sell it to him for $52,000. I’m trying to figure out a few things:

What is the real value of the guest house?
What are my legal options if I don’t want to sell?
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Buyer will make every effort to assist in the scheduling of the inspection."", and ""Buyer agrees to undertake any and all repairs identified on the inspection 
report and assist in a post-correction inspection of the property repairs.""

Have you ever seen Lender requiring Buyer to sign that at closing? 

Buyer would not sign as Home Inspection Report states a list of defects, so the Buyer won't be able to certify ""no known defects"".

Lender refuses to accept Home Inspection Report as one of documents for underwriting, to determine themselves whether Property is eligible for Conventional Loan. Looks like they are afraid they won't be able to sell the loan to Fannie / Freddie, and try to drop this responsibility to the Buyer. Lender also refuses to issue a Loan Denial Letter, stating that it is just Buyer that refused to sign a document required for a fully approved Conventional Loan.

If Buyer refused to sign, did Lender issue Loan Denial Letter or simply stated that Buyer refused to close?

The purchase contract is in loan contingency period, but the Loan Denial Letter is required from Lender to terminate it based on this contingency.

t3_1frqlzd,Should I reach out to the new owners?,"TLDR: I suspect a flipper lied during disclosures to the back up offer that just closed. We were the primary offer and walked because of several issues, but a full foundation replacement based on structural engineering report is the main reason. I have the report and communication with the seller together for significant proof the seller was aware of this.

I put an offer on a house that had been sitting significantly past average number of days on the market for the city. It was accepted. It was currently owned by a flipper/investor who did a sub-par performance on the renovations, but this meant we might be getting it at a good deal compared to comp's in the area so we submitted the offer. During the option period we discovered many things that were concerning. The investor/owner said he'd had work done on all that and it shouldn't be any issue at all. We asked for reports/receipts/work contracts to support this and he gave nothing, and also had no issues known during the disclosure.

Among others, the major concern was the foundation. He said he'd had work done for it and it should be perfect...but we hired a structural engineer who said this was a critical foundation issue and would need an entirely replaced foundation. The report also highlighted how this can't be delayed as certain parts of the house are literally not set on the foundation properly and there is significant weight just hanging pulling on the rest of the house, so the fixes should happen immediately. We got several quotes for around 30K. Also considering when major foundation repairs on pier and beam houses take place, there can be other problems occurring from that (both cosmetic and non cosmetic) so it would be conservative to account for 45-60K worth of work when estimating total cost of the foundation problem. The other issues could be delayed, but would cost another 20-40K depending on how we wanted to approach it. Along with the other known issues, this made us decide it was not worth it relative to other houses in the neighborhood.

A month later I saw that this house had sold and the consideration was for 10K more than our offer. It could be that they just absolutely loved it and didn't care about the cost, but there is no chance based on comparable properties that this price + repairs would be a reasonable price, so I don't think the seller disclosed anything we shared with them.

After dealing with this seller who seemed to have a poor moral compass with how he behaved during the process, I suspect he did not disclose the structural engineering report documenting the foundation issues to the new owners, which is of course illegal. I understand that as far as disclosures go, while there is black and white law it can be very challenging to prove what the seller knew or not.

However, we needed to extend our option period when we were under contract. The amendment written by the seller explicitly stated we can only terminate based on the structural report and that we must supply a copy if we choose to terminate. Also there are texts and emails between the seller and our realtor discussing the report. So essentially, if this person was dishonest during disclosures I have all the paperwork sitting neatly bundled together to make a case for the new owners to pursue costs to take care of this issue....

The easiest thing is for me to do nothing and just move on, but that would allow this person to have zero consequences for their actions if they lied. From my understanding it's near impossible for the new owner to discover any of this information on his/her own.

IF I wanted to politely let the new owners know about this information, how should I go about this?"

t3_1frvw1b,Advice needed on my condo,"I created this account to remain anonymous. I own a condo in a busy and touristy part of a Midwest city. I’m moving out of state for a job. I listed my condo (A) for sale about a month ago. I priced it below the price of another active listing (B). At the time there was one (C) already in escrow. Here is the price hierarchy: C &gt; B &gt; A (mine). All 3 belong to the same HOA. A couple months before that, another unit sold at B’s price.

In term of condition, C is upstairs and recently remodeled the kitchen and repainted. I’d like to think my condition is pretty good but just a little outdated compared to C (~ 80% vs C). Mine and B’s conditions are about the same and both are downstairs.

I’ve had 2 showings, of which one made an offer below asking. I ultimately rejected it because I thought my listed price was more than fair (cheapest). The lack of showing is worrying and I think buyers are now just waiting for rates to drop further. Location is certainly not an issue. To be clear, I’m paying my seller agent 2.5% and willing to pay buyer agent 2.5%.

Following my realtor’s advice, I just reduced the price by 2% but don’t think this would do anything. I prefer selling. But I’d rather rent it out than selling it out of desperation. I understand that finding a good property manager and be an out-of-state owner is not easy.

What do you all think? By the way we have not had an open house. Not sure if any serious buyers would come in either.

Looking for input on a situation. 

Mother’s house needs a ton of work, she and stepfather have very limited income and it’s inconsistent. The catch is there is a good bit of equity in the house because the neighborhood is in a hot market and they don’t owe much on the home. Given they have very limited income with no retirement and very little back in social security, what are some good options here? 

I have offered to buy the home for more than they owe with a HML and rehab it and have them move back in when it’s done and not charge them more than they were paying before. My thought is they get to live in a new home, have a small nest egg and can live their life out there and I get an asset. 

Does that seem unreasonable? "
t3_1frs4p5,Bought home with undisclosed unpermitted structural work. Recourse?,"Hi all,

My family just a bought a house in MA which seemed darn good (and still is in many respects) and we moved in two months ago. We waived the inspection contingency (because eastern Massachusetts...) but still had one done. The inspection flagged a few items as needing to be done relatively quickly but only a few things that were egregious and we could rationalize how we'd need to do the work sooner rather than later anyway. As it turns out, we have since discovered that they made several severe structural modifications to the home that affect its load carrying ability.

To give you a flavor (there are others but these are what are weighing on our minds right now from a cost perspective):

1. Removing structural columns in the basement without reinforcing the load bearing spanning beams (we can find at least 3 points that have had columns removed over a span of &gt;25 feet)
2. Removing a load bearing wall on the second floor and resting the support column for the new posts directly on the floor joists
3. Improperly installing support columns in the basement either by not resting them directly on the wood beam or by using temporary columns instead of permanent ones

I'm fortunate enough to have the money and time to address many of these issues either myself or with the appropriate contractors and specialists (pulling and closing permits along the way, of course). We have been addressing the most pressing issues first (support columns to foundation floor and furnace) but these are starting to add up (think \~25k thus far). Our worry is that once we get into the structural issues on the second and third floor (which have caused pretty severe leans in the upper floors of \~3 inches over 10 feet towards the center of the home), we may be looking at six figure repair bills just to address necessary and severe structural issues. This is because we can no longer just go into unfinished space but need to demo ceilings, refinish rooms, etc. to fix the issues.

My question: Do we have any recourse if the home was represented as having no known unpermitted work by the previous owners and we can tie the work to them (in some cases with direct admissions of them having done the work themselves). The work was done after 2005 in all cases. I've put off asking the town permitting department directly for fear that they tell us absolutely nothing has been pulled in 30+ years and now we have to disclose that fact if we go to sell them home in the future.

I have a feeling I know the answer, but just wanted to get an outside perspective. Thanks all!"
t3_1frrpo3,Wrong property title ( no CO for 2-family house),"I am buying a 2-family house in NY. Contracts signed and appraisal done. Had to sign a lease to rent out my current house ( living in it now) for the bank to approve my mortgage. The problem is that the house I am buying is not listed as 2-family in the town but taxed as 2-family. I was buying it because I need 2-family. Now, my attorney said there is no way to turn it into two family house. ( the seller thought it's 2-family ) they have 2 electric meters but the town said that was a mistake and that should have only had one electric meter because it's only one family house) I think the only thing I can do is to back off the deal after 2-3 months of being stuck with that house. What do I do? I have to move out next month because I signed the lease to rent my primary residence . Would the seller reimburse me for inspection and appraisal fees? Can I ask any reimbursement for moving out fees?"
t3_1fqki7j,Buyer accusing me of stealing my own stuff,"So we sold our house and it finally closed earlier this week.  When we listed, we’d been quite specific in the list of exclusions and inclusions on the listing. We very specifically mentioned we were leaving with a number of items that are « fixed » ie that are screwed into the walls. Stuff like some IKEA floating TV cabinets, a shelf I had custom built, curtains in the kids’ rooms that my mother had made for them custom. I get a call yesterday from the buyer accusing us of stealing from them and that I had no business taking those items. They later texted me an itemized list of what had been « stolen » with ridiculous replacement/installation prices (like 4000$ for a pair of 200$ IKEA cabinets, + 500$ to install). They’ve been harassing my realtor too. I went back and checked their initial offer and the excluded items were indeed there, so they don’t have a leg to stand on. I’m quite stressed out, I don’t need this right now. Can they really cause me any problems? I’m in Quebec. "

t3_1fqllj2,Backing out of home purchase on the day of closing,"It's to early to call my lawyer so I figured, why not post on reddit!

I find myself in an incredibly embarrassing position. After spending 5 months on the home buying process of a specific location, I am now at the day of closing and a wrench has been thrown into the system.

You see Reddit, I was motivated to buy a two family home to give my parents (and disabled brother) a more secure place to live.  They currently rent, and don't make much money.  Father is retired, mother makes 20k a yr (if that).

The intention was for my family to live downstairs and myself to live upstairs.  We found a property that, while on the smaller side, seemed to fit our needs.  Throughout this whole home buying process we ran into every snag imaginable but here we are now ready to finalize everything.

Yesterday we did our final walk through. It was me and my mother.  This was not her first time seeing the property.  However now she suddenly had so many criticisms.  Up until this point she had remained happy and looking forward to moving. I had asked her more times than I can count if this is something she wants and the answer was always yes.

Last night she unloaded how unhappy she is with the place and how much she hates it and doesn't want to move.  80% of the purpose of buying a home was for her.  As you can imagine, this has definitely knocked the wind out of my sails.  It ended up turning into a huge fight with me asking why didn't she say anything sooner. The situation is bleak now and I no longer have any interest in purchasing the home.

So, what does this all mean for me? I realize I will lose my good faith deposit (5k) but what else am I potentially looking at if I attempted to back out now?

I'm just so angry and embarrassed and wish I never did any of this.





UPDATE: I BOUGHT THE HOUSE EVERYONE! I appreciate all of your input.  It really helped put things into perspective!  I shouldn't let her feelings impact my decision (even if my initial decision to buy a house revolved around her 😅).  If she doesn't want to move in, that's her choice and I will simply rent the unit out."
t3_1frodro,Need Advice on first home investing. ,"Thoughts on first home 

Advice on our first home! 


Good afternoon everyone! 

Was looking for some advice on what my wife and I should do with our first home. We have a unique situation and want to make the most of it. 

We currently live on the Big Island of Hawaii and bought our first home from my wife’s uncle approximately 1 year ago. The house was in rough condition and they ended up selling it to us for what they bought it for back in 2008 $650,000. They are also the ones financing the loan via seller financing. We went through all the legal steps such as escrow etc etc and have a legal contract that they will finance it to us a 5% for the next 5-10 years. 

At the end of the contract and/or the interest rates drop below 5% we will need to refinance with a bank. 

The Zillow estimate of the house is approximayely 1.6 million. We’ve put a lot of work into the house by ourselves and will continue to do so as finances and time provide. 

We’ve been discussing moving to the mainland due to cost of living and being closer to my family. What should we do with our house? Would selling be the best option and buying outright in the mainland with our profit.

What about HELOC? And then renting the residence? 

What are your thoughts? Appreciate the input "

t3_1frlxyq,How to predict appraisal on a new construction home in an old neighborhood?,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, so moderators feel free to remove me if not. That said, I’m desperate for some advice on what to expect for an appraisal! We are under contract on a parcel of land in the best neighborhood, but the finances to build will not work well for us if we don’t get a good appraisal. We plan to complete the appraisal in next few months before we start building but after we close on the land, which our builder requires. The details are… 

- House is in an old neighborhood in Eastern VA, most houses averaging 1965 builds. No new builds have sold for comparison. 
- Comparable older homes in the neighborhood go for $220/sqft, often needing some work. 
-There are no really similar neighborhoods with new builds in city or county (neighborhood has water access, lake and marina, and club house with pool), except for one that’s also a gated golf club. A couple luxury new builds in that neighborhood go for $350-550 + /sq ft .
-New construction homes that have recently sold in the city in general go from $190-300 per square foot, and some nearby that are new construction for sale (but not really in a ‘neighborhood’) are $250-300 
- We want to make it work because the location is amazing, walking distance to pool and marina on a corner lot. We plan to build a mostly single-level home with nice outdoor space. The lot is a level 0.6 acres, others are larger (up to 2 acres) but often with slopes, but maybe a water view. 


I guess my questions are: Is there a typical amount that new builds tend to land above older comps? And how much do the things we like about the house/lot factor in? Is there any way to ballpark our appraisal before we start work on the land? 

Thanks in advance for your valuable advice!! "

Long story short I close in a week and the seller has completed all the fixes we asked for but there’s one specific thing that I’m not sure how to proceed on. 

On the defect notice we said that the electrical service entrance was degraded and needs REPLACED (important detail). The electrician instead wrapped it in electrical tape. Which is not what we agreed upon but it was done by a licensed electrician. 

I close in a week and I let my agent know that I wanted it brought up to see if the seller would agree to a credit so I can fix it myself. We haven’t heard back from them but I’m preparing for the worst. 

So my question is if they say no to providing me a credit what recourse do I have. They DID sign the defect notice agreeing to the fixes which stated it needed REPLACED. Is there anything I can do about it? I don’t want to walk away over this one little thing when everything else is fine, but I don’t want to get screwed over and I want them held accountable for what they agreed to do. I’m thinking of hiring a real estate attorney but I’m not sure if it’s worth it this close to close. Any relevant advice welcome!

t3_1frbwp8,Can I sue for damages?,"My Buyers Agent says we should…

BLUF: We purchased a home in Alabama and moved there from Colorado just to find out 30 minutes from closing there was a problem which led to my approved lending being revoked.

In Alabama they have a thing called Right of Redemption. The home wasn’t listed with this information. The Seller and Selling Agent is an independent cash investor who purchased the home at auction, made some improvements, flipped, and then listed. The title company discovered this a few days before closing. Since the investor was cash they are allowed to assume the risk and never attained a bond which left us requiring a new bond for my lender. The seller actually agreed to pay for the bond at 1% of the property value. This had to be approved by the lender but was rejected on the grounds that it did not cover the totality of the liability which they believed was greater since the right of redemption is not for an individual, but from their estate since the previous owner had passed away. This meant I was suddenly on the hook to cover the larger liability in cash, which was out of my reach.

I’ve incurred several thousands invested into this transaction in various fees, packing/moving, and an Air-B&amp;B for several weeks due to the delay. I was hemorrhaging cash daily and needed somewhere to house the family fast, ended up in a rental with a year lease. And on top of all this I’ve still got a mortgage back in Colorado… We packed up our whole lives with the understanding that this was imminent. If the bond and right f redemption information was disclosed from the jump none of this would have happened.

Well the monthly estimated payment is like $2400 and my husband thinks that’s too steep. 

Would it be smart to wait on going through with the process? I’m sure a higher down payment will help, right? And so will working on our credit some more and saving some more.

t3_1fr1iv4,Seller wants to remain in house for 2 days to move,"Hi,

First time home buyer here. I think I screwed up. The seller wanted two extra days to move out after escrow closes and we agreed to allow that for free. So the contract that we signed states that he needs to be out on the 2nd day by 6 pm and at that time we become in possession of the home. From what I’m reading, we should have asked for payment per diem for the 2 days and then made it so there is a deposit held in the escrow until the seller has fully vacated. Is it too late to ask that a funds be held in escrow until the seller fully vacates? We still have 25 days until closing. This little item has been keeping me up at night. I feel like our realtor led us astray. He did say these are super normal and common and go off without a hitch and for me to not worry about it…but naturally I’m worrying about it.

If the seller has not vacated by the second day, I am thinking I could call the local law enforcement to remove him from the property and provide our contract to show that he’s not supposed to be there. 

To also be fair to the seller, he has already started packing his things. But he needs to close on this home to close on the other then move his stuff. I am just worried he’s not out on time or that he damages something on the way out. And maybe this will just be a (hopefully not too expensive) lesson for me."

Today it just popped up again with the price $50k lower and have an open house on Sunday. Even with $50k off, it’s still too expensive.

I think that would give us a better chance of negotiating for a lower price.

Is that an asshole move to our buyers agent?

t3_1fr258y,Realtor Abandoning Contract,"I have a realtor (in the US) who is trying to leave a contract right when a good deal is all worked out to sell a property.
I have no desire to come after her legally (she seems like she's just having a truly hard time right now), but I'm not sure about what to do for selling it now.

I know who the realtor representing the other party is (the property was listed under the old commission agreement where the seller pays the buyer's agent), and the price and terms are already negotiated for the sale, so I'm wondering if there's any downside to using the buyer's agent to work both sides and offering her 1. either exactly the same amount since it's no longer expected for the seller to pay the buyer's agent or 2. the amount she was expecting plus 1% more.
Alternatively, should I just hire a different seller agent and keep the same commission  offer for the buyer's agent?

I don't dabble much in real estate and something like the realtor breaking the contract is something that I have absolutely no experience in or insight on.
If anyone can advise me on this or even some resources to check out, I'd greatly appreciate it.



EDIT: For anyone who finds this in the future with the same question, it looks like terminating the contract (unconditional termination) followed by contacting the buyer's agent directly and offering 1% more was the right answer for me.
I am, obviously, not a lawyer, nor a professional in real estate by any means, and an advisor of mine did caution me to pay extra attention to closing fees in the final contract, but this is a viable option for me.

As stated in the comments, I could've also chosen to pass it along to another agent in her firm, and I'm also aware that I could've picked a different person entirely (without a ""sure"" thing, insomuch as a financial transaction can be a sure thing, I'd have given my contract to my plan B agent that I'd found before I contacted plan A), but in my particular case, it works out well to get a ""bonus"" for the sale."

Right now I have 60,000 in cash I can use for a down payment. I don’t know exactly where to start. I was interested in buying a property for investment purposes and not to live in one half.

t3_1fqqr5k,How do I get out of a contract when term can’t be met?,5 days ago my house went under contract however 12 hours after being under contract the buyers agent wanted me to up my sales price by 15k so her buyers could put their closing cost in. I said no what if it doesn’t appraise for that much. We are already under contract for them to pay their closing cost. I just dont want to inflate my price that much. It’s a bit excessive. Well now that I said no and that if she can’t go by the contract then sign a release and be done with it and give the buyers their emd. The agent wouldn’t sign it and now she is pretty much hold my house hostage till I cave and accept her new conditions. She can hold my house up for a month. There is no way her clients can come up with the closing costs which I feel bad for them truly I do but I can’t afford to pay their closing costs and mine. What can I do? Is there any hope for me or do I just have to wait till it expires?
t3_1fr3vnq,Closing Costs (IL),"I'm currently contingent in the home buying process, and have inspectors coming next week. Little $50K one story house in the country. My income isn't great but going from nearly $1K rent to a $500 mortgage (into a house I can one day sell etc) is nice. But as someone who is young and knows little about the homebuying process, these loan closing costs are rediculous. $6K, which is around 12% of the total loan, not to mention close to half my savings, just to acquire the loan is really offputting. By that logic I have to go well past 2 years of mortgage as opposed to my rent just to make back the wallet hole that the closing costs open up, not to even mention the repair costs the home may need. Kinda bummed and offput. Anyone know of any tips or tricks or recommendations I'm missing here? For reference I'm using a local/regional bank, have a credit score from 750-800, and do not have points as part of my mortgage. Thanks"
t3_1fqw1w5,Feel stuck. Trying to get better income. ,"I am 31 and single in the sense that when getting a mortgage it would only be me despite having a long term girlfriend who contributes half. My current rent is $3k and I only make $60k a year. We split rent in half and otherwise besides some groceries I pay for every other expense myself. 

I live below my means for the most part despite this high rent cost, I’m only 2 months into a 12 month lease. I still can’t qualify for a mortgage in WA State all I’m offered is $175k, I have $200k I can put down as a down payment and still don’t qualify. I thought it would be better to pay the $6k to break a lease if I was qualified rather than pay the remainder of the lease and stay in the apartment. 

Feels like I’ll never achieve ownership when all my friends got in for far far less in 2019/2020 with great interest rates. Trying to find a better job to better my income. I know if my girl and I went in together it would increase the approval amount but I can’t ask that of her and I don’t feel comfortable since we aren’t yet engaged or married. 

Just need words of encouragement, I feel like I’m failing so hard and I’m already 31. "
t3_1fqyofh,Looking for some advice on a crazy situation involving my family home,"This is a pretty bizarre situation that several realtors and lawyers we’ve talked to have never been in.

So about a decade ago, my parents had to declare bankruptcy, and got screwed over by a scummy lawyer that intentionally filed the wrong class of bankruptcy. This resulted in my dad going a while without insulin for his diabetes (this may be relevant later), leading to significant damage to his heart. One day they woke up, they were informed the house wasn’t protected, and had to provide $30,000 (the remaining cost of the $200,000 home they had been paying off since the 90s) within a week, or the house was gone. 

My mom’s sister stepped in, and “purchased” the house. She had arranged with my parents that they would pay her back monthly, basically rent, until she was made whole (and my parents would also be responsible for paying the property taxes as well, which they did). I was told that the purchase was a little murky and the lawyers had to leave the room when the deal was signed.

After around 5 years pass, my parents approach my aunt, after calculating they had paid her back plus some interest, about receiving ownership of the house. We had issues with properly filing insurance claims through my aunt as well, as when severe weather events affected the house (we live in Houston, Texas), she would send out a friend of hers to fix things that seemed out of his ability. My aunt basically says “sure, you can purchase my house for $180,000”. My parents are floored, and both parties lawyer up. Our lawyer advises us we may have claim to our house due to some Homestead Act, and that we should try to pressure my aunt with court.

Eventually, my parents and my aunt go to mediation, where my aunt refuses to negotiate. They spend a whole day trying to make offers to which my aunt would not budge. Paying for the lawyer starts to get expensive, but luckily this lawyer is a family friend who gets flexible with payment. My Dad gets laid off by his new company out of nowhere after being there for years, and ends up filing (and successfully settling) an age discrimination case, but unfortunately he could not afford his heart medication for a month during all this and takes a serious step back health wise. He finds a new job, but gets let go shortly after being hired, and ends up in the hospital for a week where he loses a bunch of weight. He finally finds a new job (which seems like a much better fit for him, that also offers a life insurance policy that conveniently would cover the price of the house). 

My parents and my aunt go to court for a second mediation. At the beginning, our lawyer informs us we shouldn’t go to court, and that the case needs to be settled, and that he won’t be willing to represent us in court (it seems like this case is costing him money that he won’t be making back at this point). My parents are shocked again, and my mom storms out of court, but they say they understand and offer 180,000 for the house. The mediator comes back and informs us my aunt is now asking for $280,000, as she now has familial debt to repay (I guess that’s how she could afford her lawyer this whole time).

Eventually, they reach an agreement. The deal is that they have 90 days to qualify to purchase the house at $235,000, and if they don’t qualify in 90 days, they agree to sell the house in the next 90 days, where my aunt gets the first $250,000, and then my parents get whatever is made above that (the house could go for anywhere from $278,000 to $370,000 according to OpenDoor, but there’s some significant repairs required that will likely cost a chunk). If no deal is reached, i believe the agreement states that anyone living on the property is expected to vacate, and they are to return to mediation. My parents agree to this primarily because their combined income is comfortably enough to qualify for the house. My dad signs, and my mom does as well but she was not present for a lot of the case (as she kept storming out of the court room)

3 days later, I get a call from my mom to check on my dad and find him dead in our living room. He started his new job the day before, and was extremely dizzy and fell the night before. Doctors warned a fall could kill him because of his meds, but he was scared of going to the hospital again and losing his new job. He started his new job on the day before, signed up for benefits but apparently the life insurance doesn’t kick in for 30 days (and we couldn’t get any through his last job, so we’re at zero i think). He mentioned he felt he needed to lower his medication due to weight he lost in the hospital as well, but didn’t get to.

It looks like my mom can not afford to qualify for $235,000 by herself. Ironically, it looks like the most she could qualify for herself is $180,000 (I believe she makes around 47,000 a year between 2 jobs). I’m a recent college grad (I’m a music teacher, not a lot of money) and have only been working for a year and a half (and honestly, I don’t know if purchasing this house is smart for me). I live with my partner who could theoretically qualify with my mom, but they also are very hesitant about purchasing the house (houses are expensive, the place needs some pretty big repairs, and often we struggle to get along with my mom). We also have a few roommates lined up and are getting ready to move out, and fear if we don’t move out now, we may not still have the roommates lined up in a few months (we may have them still, just can’t really predict things like this).


Is there any world where we can save the house without my partner or me trying to purchase it with my mom? My aunt refuses to talk to us and there’s been issues communicating with our lawyer since my dad died, and we only have about a month left to qualify if we want to try. I’m just looking for my options or solutions, and want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation. Is there a world where my mom can keep this house by herself? If not, do you think it’s smarter for me to walk away, or to spend a few months here trying to repair it and sell it with my mom so my partner and I walk away with some of the profit, as well as making sure everyone is in a spot where they can afford to move out instead of being at the behest of the courts?

TL:DR my family home was legally(?) stolen by my aunt, and my parents agreed to purchase it a week before my dad died. Now my mom can’t afford it, and I don’t know what to do."

t3_1fr319t,Fallout from 2019 foreclosure,"My dad (53) is in the midst of the fallout from a foreclosure in California in 2019.  In 2017 My dad was in a bad place mentally and emotionally and walked away from his job, family and house.  He moved across the country and stopped paying his first mortgage. His HELOC was on auto pay on a savings account he rarely used and he just forgot about. 

My dad did not leave a forwarding address and just completely ignored the entire situation.  He never received or was served with any of the foreclosure documents which is entirely on him. In 2019 and the home was foreclosed upon.  From the i have done online the house sold at auction for more then the total of his first and HELOC. 

Fast forward to now. My dad got the treatment he needed and has spent the past few years rebuilding his life. He moved back to California, rebuilt his family and friend relationship and secured a good job. He decided to buy a house again and qualified for an FHA loan given that the foreclosure was more than three years ago. He also rebuilt his credit and saved for a down payment.  He worked with a mortgage broker and was conditionally qualified for the loan. 

This is where the problems started. He pulled his consumer credit reports and all three showed the HELOC as closed but there was an oddity. The HELOC had continued to auto draw the payments until March 2023 when the payments stopped.  When the broker pulled his credit the supplements showed different information. The supplements showed the account open and a balance due. 

Confused between the differences on his consumer report showing closed and the supplements showing open he called the HELOC service and figured he could resolve this easily. Not the case. The HELOC service had purged the loan from their system since their policy is to purge after an account has no payments for 14 months. 

The customer service agent looked into what information they could find in the purged account system and what they could find is that there was no status on whether the account was open or closed, no balance or disposition status. Just that it wasn’t in their system.  The agent opened a ticket and requested an account p payment/transaction history report and he received it this morning.  The report shows that no balance is for and it shows that the principle was paid off in April 2023. The problem is it doesn’t show who or how the balance was paid out whether the loan was sold/ m transferred. It just shows that he does not have a balance with them which contradicts what was reported on the credit supplements. The only odd this I noticed was the principle payoff was one cent less than the amount owed. 

I was in the phone with him and the HELOC services as he is supposed to close in ten days and this is the only hold up with underwriting.  He sent in a request to their research department to explain and clear up the issues and was told that will take up to 30 days        Likely he won’t be able to get this resolved in time and will not be able to close on this loan. 

So now my questions:

1)Since he didn’t payoff the loan how else would it show as principle paid?

If the loan was sold or transferred I would reasonably expect the new creditor would show up in his credit report especially after not making payments for nearly eighteen months. 

2) Since this was a foreclosure was the HELOC allowed to continue to collect payments after the December 2019 foreclose through March 2023?

3) Is it possible the loan principle was paid via a charge off?  Nothing in the payment history indicates that. 

4) Is there even a concept that some type of insurance the lender had  paid off the loan?  I don’t know if that is a thing.

5 Any other advice you can recommend?

I know this is long yet it is a very confusing situation. 


tl;dr: Dad was foreclosed upon and had issues with his HELOC. I have some questions. "

t3_1fqp69y,House sale during divorce,"We are looking at a house for sale in which the couple is selling because of a divorce. The house is significantly overpriced. They bought it a couple of years ago according to house sigma and now have it listed for 500k more with nothing done to it since moving in. Looking at the pictures they have really let it go downhill in the short time they have owned it - like the shower tiling now needs to be replaced etc. 

According to their realtor the wife has moved out and wants to sell and the husband is still living there alone and doesn't, hence the overpricing. The realtor agreed it's over priced, has told them that and seemed exasperated that it was listed so high as well and said hopefully if it sits for a while with no showings etc that they will be willing to come down in price. 

I know in a divorce that a judge can order the sale of a house. Is there any sort of time frame that is usually given for that kind of thing where they would have to lower the price in say 6 months if they had no offers or can they just go on forever with it overpriced if the husband wants to keep living there? 

Edit: the reason I want the house is my sister bought the house next door and we run a buisiness together etc. So it's not something where I can just pick another house :( I really want this one XD"
t3_1fr169h,Survey shows more land than entered into contract for,"I’m in contract to buy a house in Arkansas, and we paid for a survey.

I asked my realtor to get with the sellers agent and get some kind of explanation in writing cause it sounds kind of sketchy to me, but my realtor said I’m not likely to get it. 

It sounds like something isn’t or wasn’t done right and I don’t want to find myself in a legal situation. What documentation would show the portion of property as legally transferred? Can the seller just ask a new surveyor to re-draw the lines without that portion?

We bought the home for $500 in 2021, market has actually gone up since then in our area.

t3_1fqz3rb,"First Home, Home Inspection Results","Hey all, just looking for some insight. 

There’s a town house I’m looking to purchase that was built in 2018, interior unit. We did the inspection last night and some issues came up that I’m not sure if they are big or small. 

1) Lots of dry wall cracks. Some big (in length, not width), some small. Mostly running along the ceiling in straight lines but there was one horizontal crack in between two door frames that are side by side. There were two that ran in a straight line most of the length of their respective rooms. No discoloration so I assume the drywall just wasn’t installed right

2) Balcony door stick when opened 

3) a couple squeaky stairs

4) the dining room windows don’t lock properly, the lock is misaligned with the catch, so you can’t turn the switch all the way. 

5) there’s one spot on the roof where the flashing needs fixed 

6) stairs to the rooftop terrace are missing a handrail entirely, which is actually a code violation. 

7) On the rooftop terrace there are two carve outs for rain to drip down, however water is pooling right before the drain. So it appears that the terrace’s floor doesn’t have the grading that it should’ve. I’m not sure how big of an issue it is to fix that? 

8) In the attic, I’ll just quote the report… 

&gt; Tape joints on the fire separation wall are deteriorated / pealing. Fire barrier has been compromised, exposed joints with a gap. Recommend correction by a qualified contractor / handyman to maintain fire barrier. 

9) also attic, rusted nails indicating high humidity, recommended installing an attic fan 

10) some grouting needs to be redone in the bathroom. 


Does any of this sound horrific to anyone? Like a “run away” level of issues for a 5-6yr old townhome? It’s my first house, and while I understand every home has issues, I’m trying to make sure I’m not signing up for tens of thousands of dollars in repairs"
t3_1fqz0ni,Buyer broker nightmare ,"Please advise. Husband and I saw a listing for a property and wanted to jump on it. We have a friend who is a realtor, but who was unavailable when the listing popped up. We contacted the listing agent (directly, not through Zillow) and left a message (no answer). A woman named ""R"" from the same brokerage called us back right away and told us that listing agent ""V"" was out of town but that she could help us. She explained that the property was section 8 tenant occupied and difficult to get into because ""the tenants were being difficult,"" but that she could get us in to view it the following day at 6pm. Not wanting to miss the opportunity, we agreed. She mentioned that we would need to sign some papers but that she would explain everything there. 

We got there and were in the middle of unloading our 3 small children from the car when ""R"" handed me a clipboard and said something like ""this is a formality because of the new laws- but once you sign this we're in compliance, and then I can show you the house."" Given that we were there and wanted to see the house, stupid me just signed it. Turns out that was a buyer broker agreement. She never reviewed what was in it or gave us a copy of it. That night I googled ""what do you sign before viewing a house"" and realized what we had done. 

We decided just hope for the best and move forward with this woman because we didn't want to miss out on the property. 

Turns out she owns the brokerage, so she's not just the agent, and the seller/listing agent is also from her brokerage. We happen to know the seller personally, and he was on sight when we viewed the house (he had to open a large shop on the property so we could view it) and was pleased to see that we wanted it. 
Long story short, after a week and half of confusing back and forth, we got such a bad deal in the end that we walked away from the sale. The seller contacted us privately and was furious; explained that he was not at all happy with the way he was represented and we explained that we weren't either. 

Now we want to know how to get out of this agreement. If I submit a written request to cancel the agreement and ""R"" refuses, what are our options? We cannot wait out the length of the contract- it's 90 days with a 30 day extension and seller wants to close before the end of the year for financial purposes. Please help!"
t3_1fqxm9o,Moving to Cincinnati 2025.,Partner and I are first time home buyers with no plans to have children. Looking at homes online and we love the cottage style homes so far. What are some of the best neighborhoods to live in. Wife and I are very young but through the power of our Lord and hard work we are very financially blessed but still reasonable when it comes to the cost of our future home.  
t3_1fqxjt5,Question about my rights as a seller,"Here is my situation.  We sold/selling a home with farm land.  The home and land are selling separately to the same buyers.  We were offered a total price for both and split the price up on separate contracts for each property.  The offer was for $350,000.  It broke down as $269,000 for the house and $81,000 for the land.  We have a realtor that is handling this for us.  The contracts were signed on 4/28/24 with a closing date of 6/15/24.  The house appraised for $250,000, so we ended up negotiating a lower price for the house.  After a lot of hassle with closing on the house, we finally closed on 6/28/24 with the house.  The land is being financed thru the Farm Service Agency and I know that financing thru them can take some time.  We are now at today's date without closing on the land.  We have been very lenient.  My patience has run thin.

Throughout this process, we have never signed any extension on the original closing date.  The title company paid off both the house and the land with the closing of the house.  This wasn't discussed with us.  Our realtor took her entire commission for both the house and the land out of the closing of the house.  This wasn't discussed with us either.  I asked our realtor why we have never signed an extension on the closing date.  Her response was ""yeah, we should probably do that"".  She sent me documents to sign to extend the date last week, I am not signing them.  The realtor will only give updates when I ask for them.  We were promised that it would close by 9/1/24 and that passed.  We don't live in the area anymore but have been told that the person buying it from us has been on the land without asking for our permission.

What are my options?"
t3_1fq28gi,"""Points are a scam."" No, they're not.","I've seen this idea a few times on a couple of threads today, so I figured I'd make a post about it, to start a discussion on this, and hopefully learn some things myself. 

There seems to be this idea that buying points is a bad thing. People have posted their closing costs, and that line about points seems to get some folks fired up. A few choice phrases I've seen:

* Points are a scam.
* Points are for those who don't know how to properly shop for a mortgage
* If a bank/broker are offering points it's because it's always in their favor
* Don't pay points. Just don't do it. Use a local lender instead.

This is not right at all (that last line really confused me, what do the points have to do with the institution?). While buying points does incur an upfront cost, in many situations this can be helpful. First, lets talk about what points are. When it comes down to it:

**Points are a bribe you give to the bank for a lower interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage.**

That's it. Lets look at a scenario:

I'm a buyer, I want to buy my forever home, I have good credit, and no current debt. I have $100,000 of my savings earmarked for a down payment, but I'd like to keep some of it for furniture, upgrades, etc. I found a house I love, they accepted my offer of $400k. Now, I go down to my local community bank -- they offer great interest rates, no fees, and they're friendly and knowledgeable, far more than the big online boys. 

I tell the loan officer I have 20% down - 80k, and I'm looking to borrow 320k at a fixed rate, over 30 years. He tells me my credit is great, and he can get me a 5% rate, and shows me a amortizing schedule, summarized as follows:


Desc | Amt 
---|---
Loan Amount | $320,000
Interest Rate | 5%
Term | 30 Years (360 Payments)
APR | 5%
Monthly Payment (P&amp;I) | $1,717.83

 It then goes on to show me how much I'll pay on every payment, what portion goes to interest, versus principal all the way through the 360th payment. A bit of math shows:

After year| You will have paid in interest: | In principal:
---|---|---
1	|$15,892.78|$4,721.17
2	|$31,544.02|$9,683.88
3	|$46,941.35|$14,900.50
5	|$76,921.69|$26,148.06
8	|$119,640.86|$45,270.74
15	|$206,437.76|$102,771.49
20	|$254,238.26|$158,040.74
30	|$298,418.51|$320,000.00

So, over the life of this loan, I will have paid nearly $300k in interest, and $320k in principal. I tell the loan officer, that it seems crazy that I'm paying 300k to borrow this. I'm sure I could refinance this later if rates go down, and I suppose that even if this is my forever home, life may have different ideas, and I may sell it before that 30 years, but... lets just assume I plan on keeping it for the foreseeable future and that rates aren't likely to go down in the next 5-10 years.

The loan officer says I can buy points in order to lower that rate. He said, for $3,200, he'd lower the rate by 25 basis points making my interest rate 4.75%. I ask him to show me the numbers again, side by side:

Desc | Loan 1 | Loan 2
---|---|---
Loan Amount | $320,000 | $320,000
Interest Rate | 5% | 4.75%
Points Cost | 0 | $3200
Term | 30 Years | 30 years
APR | 5% | 4.8%
Monthly Payment (P&amp;I) | $1,717.83 | $1,669.27	


Ok, I'm saving $48.56 month-to-month, but was it worth paying $3200 for? It depends. It will take 66 payments (five and a half years), saving $48.56 per payment in order to make up for that. If I keep the house for this long, I'll break even on that points investment.

But what about the whole loan? I will be saving nearly $50 per payment, but what does that equal:

After year| You will have paid in interest Loan 1: | Paid in interest AND points in Loan 2:
---|---|---
1	|$15,892.78|$18,293.42
2	|$31,544.02|$33,147.12
3	|$46,941.35|$47,749.46
5	|$76,921.69|$76,150.65
8	|$119,640.86|$116,542.30
15	|$206,437.76|$198,274.55
20	|$254,238.26|$243,034.25
30	|$298,418.51|$284,137.73

So looking at this, in loan 2 even before I've made my first payment, I'm already out $3200 compared to loan 1. However, the interest savings show that somewhere in year 5, I start saving money compared to loan 1.

By the end of the 30 years, I'll have paid over $14k more in loan 1 versus buying points in loan 2.

The loan officer tells me this is just an example, and I can buy the amount of points I feel comfortable with - he says for every 1% of the loan amount I give him, he will knock .25% off the interest rate. (This will vary from bank-to-bank). 

This is where you compare the APR - this takes into account the cost of the points/fees plus the total amount of interest paid and comes up with an actual rate. In the example above, buying another point for $3200 brings the interest rate from 4.75% to 4.5% and the APR from 4.8% down to 4.67%.

Choosing to buy points and how many points can depend on your situation - do you have enough cash to buy those points, if so are you taking away from your down payment? If you're under but close to a 20% down payment it may be worth skipping the points and hitting that 20% to avoid PMI. 

If you don't know how long you plan to own the place, or if you plan on refinancing soon (rates going down?), or if you'd rather keep your extra money in the market or elsewhere may all impact your decision to buy points and how much to buy. Remember, homeowners stay in a home for eight years on average, and many may refinance before then as well.

To those saying ""it's a scam, it's only benefiting the lender"" - it is true that it is usually in the interest of a lender to sell you points, BUT it's value is as hedge against inflation and the cost of reselling loans - not as a way of sticking it to the borrower, getting more money out of the borrower. All things being equal, over the 30 year loan, a borrower buying points will pay less to the bank than a borrower who didn't buy points.

Please feel free to correct me where I'm wrong, or even tell me if I'm flat out bonkers.

p.s. somewhat unrelated, but another myth to be busted: banks don't ""Frontload interest in a mortgage"" as a way of sticking it to borrowers either - it's just the way amortization works. You have a big balance at the beginning of the loan, you pay interest as a percentage of the balance. As the balance decreases, so does the interest amount.

**tldr:** In conclusion, points are a tool, not a scam. Points lower your interest rate and monthly payments and you (hopefully) own the property long enough for the savings to cover cost of those points. Balancing how many points versus how long you plan on owning the property is key.

t3_1fqwzkv,Realtor Question,"Hello! Quick question about the situation im in. I saw a house i like and just setup a time to see it with the realtor selling the house. They ended up having one of their partners meet me out there to look around. My question is, this partner at the same company is saying they can be my realtor by doing some dual agency thing. My parents contacted their realtor to see if this situation is okay and their realtor said it’s not really in my best interest to use the person i went and looked at the house with. Just trying to get some clarification and see what my best route is. Get my own independent realtor not affiliated with the place listing the house or continue with them?

t3_1fr1lk9,Brother in Law wants a buy out for the family home,"Hello all-

I reside in a multi-generational home that my partner grew up in. The owner of the home is my partner's elderly grandmother who is still alive. There is still a mortgage on the home that we have agreed to pay once Grandma passes. Recently, our brother in law approached me and said something about ""buying out"" his share when the Gradmother passes away. This topic has never been discussed at any point in us living here nor prior to us moving in. We honestly cannot afford to buy out all of the siblings, either through cash or remortgage. The home is set to be inherited by my partner's mother in the will but discussions have recently started taking place about changing the will to reflect ownership split 5 ways (mother and 4 children).  Interestingly, said brother in law has recently ""befriended"" the elderly Grandmother and has become her confidant. This all smells a little fishy to me and seems like brother in law is looking for a way to make some extra cash (the house is valued in the millions).  I have done some research and found out that all inheriting parties have to agree how they want to handle the property after the death of the owner, but that one partner can ""force"" the sale if the parties remain indecisive. I'm fine with selling and using our share for a down payment elsewhere but my partner and his mother do not want to sell as they both grew up in the home. This long story leads me to my question: can one party ""force"" the people who want to live in the home to buy them out and if not what are our options if this gets ugly after Grandma passes away? "

My mother in law wants to give my wife (her daughter) and I her house in Texas. She’s asked me to work out the logistics.

MIL owes ~$25k, on the ~$200k property. We would have to get a loan ourselves to pay this off, mortgage or home equity, not sure, and would like to pull out some cash from the equity in order to make some repairs. 

What is the most cost-effective way for us to take ownership of the property? I’m worried about getting hit with gift taxes, or double closing costs (if we assume her mortgage, then immediately refinance).

What’s the best way to navigate this? I’ve seen people talking about putting the home in a trust and me inheriting it. Does this change anything on my end rather than just buying out what she owes? 

I would have to get a loan for the 340k but for a first house I don’t think that’s a bad price to pay and have equity off the start.

She would like to live in it until she passes and just have me figure out how to set it up so once she is gone I can instantly start the process of ownership.

t3_1fquec5,help with land boundary issues through title company,"Me and my wife are in the process of purchasing our first home with our closing date just a few weeks away. County records show our land is land locked with no easement ever recorded to use our drive way and our title company has advised they show the same information, and that without a easement they will not give us title insurance for any future lawsuits regarding the boundaries of the property and they would want us to sign a release in order to continue with our purchase absolving them of any legal proceedings we encounter in the future. They also said we could never mortgage the property and can only sale it with a cash sale in the future which is also why they think we should terminate. We contacted the supposed owners of the sellers drive way and they advised us that they do not own it and actually showed us the property lines which are clearly marked with paint on trees showing the drive way is in fact on the sellers property after all. They were kind enough to take their proof to our title company. Now our title company is saying it belongs to a different neighbor and scout data is incorrect but that it still doesn't belong to the seller; even though more than likely it does and the county has just made a mistake. Wouldn't the deed prove the drive way does in fact belong to the seller and why cant the title company verify that way? Based on advise from reddit we are having a survey done and it should be done sometime next week. The title company told us that a survey will be pointless because a surveyor will use the same scout data the county uses which shows the incorrect information; but i am hoping they are incorrect about this and a survey will correct the error and show the land does in fact belong to the seller; especially if a surveyor has access to the actual deed to the sellers property. Can anyone advise if the title company can be wrong about what they are saying and that a surveyor can actually prove that the counties data is simply incorrect and possibly when this happened to get things reported incorrectly? It just feels like the title company isn't being helpful at all in this situation and just trying to say they are right and we are wrong and nothing is going to change it when the neighbor and the seller are all saying the opposite. I would appreciate any advice and thank you so much. "

t3_1fqu7ns,Neighbor trying to take communal area.,"I am one of 5 units built on the same lot.

In the listings for all units it says we have a communal green space. We have in writing from the sellers when we purchased the property via buyer agent (no hoa). That we would form a communal agreement for what to put in the greenspace and other items. Now a new buyer has tried to close off the access to the communal area with a lock, which is hilarious, and this is somewhat rhetorical but being as they think this is for themselves (even though their listing says communal greenspace), who is the ultimate enforcer of this or does it eventually come down to a legal threat? I'm really not sure as it's in writing and in the listing. Is this basically the bottom line of all this communal living stuff? It's a little drab but I'm assuming so.

It's sad because the other units have friendly owners but all of the homes are new and one particular person is literally putting a lock on the communal area thinking it's for themselves because they couldn't read properly or are just lying and live close to it (not sure which but will assume it's a misunderstanding until proven otherwise).

t3_1fqrkdu,New Build Flood Zone,"My wife and I are in the market to buy our first home. We’ve looked at a few and really like the idea of a new build presale. We found one we really like on a lot we really like. It is .91 acres. 

The issue, the back end of the lot (about the last 45 feet or so) would be in a flood zone. A few lots down the entire street is in the flood zone. They have made a retaining pond with channels and ensure us that FEMA is to come out soon to reevaluate their engineering work and remove the flood zone.

We submitted a contract with the contention that the entire lot is removed from the flood plain which we assumed wouldn’t be an issue since they have already done the dirt work and it’s just a matter of FEMA coming out. They rejected and countered saying the Lot should be removed but right now they can only give proof that the actual structure of the house would not be in flood zone. 

We don’t really feel entirely comfortable. Although it isn’t a huge deal that the end of the lot would be in flood zone and we probably wouldn’t have to buy flood insurance it worries us to take their word for it. I’m not as worried about flood insurance as I am worried about resale value. If we are this cautious of it, odds are the next buyers would be too in the off chance that FEMA designates it still in Flood zone"

t3_1fqtwvl,"Ex gifted part of the downpayment but is not on mortgage or deed, should they get their money back?","My ex and I purchased a home in MA two years ago. Since we were not married, the purchase was based on my income alone, but we both equally contributed to the downpayment. A family member of theirs ""gifted"" their portion of the downpayment, and then they were going to be paying this family member back over time. It was an official gift letter from this family member, to me, for the purchase of this home. The mortgage is in my name, the deed is in my name, the roof loan for the new roof is in my name. My ex paid about 35% of the monthly mortgage payment, paid utilities, and put in 15% of the roof cost.

My ex recently decided to end our relationship of 6 years. There was emotionally cheating involved. I had originally planned to at least give them their portion of the downpayment that they, or technically the family member, contributed, and then give them back what they contributed to the new roof. I don't have this kind of money on hand, though, so I was going to figure out maybe borrowing it from a family member or if I do sell the house, using the equity to pay them back.

Less than two weeks after our break up, however, I found out my ex is now with the person I was told not worry about and I'm feeling super bitter and betrayed. More lies have come to the surface because of this and I am just disgusted. It feels insane to me now to give them back this large chunk of money after all the lies, betrayal and just plain disrespect. It's like allowing them to ""have their cake, and eat it too"", if that makes sense.

I'd really appreciate some advice/input on this. Legally do I need to give them their downpayment back? Can they sue me if I don't?"

However, I'm being told that is not the case and the buyers still have to pay their agent. To me it seems this only hurts sellers instead of helping them because I would imagine most buyers are going to ask sellers to cover their fee too.

t3_1fqzjzn,Buyers closing attorney asking for mom's marital status for an estate sale doesn't seem to think,"I am selling a house for my grandmother who passed away that is part of an estate that was probated. 

I am the executor authorized by the court. I have the letters of testamentary. I am also the beneficiary of her assets. 

The will reads like this: If my mother was married at the time my grandmother passed away the house would go to me. If she was not married at the time of my grandmothers passing we would split it. My grandmother talked to my mom about this before her passing so my mom knew. 

My mom is married and was married at the time my grandmothers passing. 

I gave the closing attorney her marital status.

4 days basically 3 days before closing and right before a weekend at the end of the day on a Friday, the closing attorney suddenly reaches out to my realtor (not me) and asked if she could have my mother send them an email with her marital status. After I had been corresponding with them for a week and half. The realtor knows my mom so she called her and asked her what was going on. 

I understand everyone is probably covering their butts given that it is a unique situation and in general there is a lot of fraud out there. They would probably be less likely to question it if my grandmother had left everything to my mom because that's usually the normal order of things. 

I think that it's weird and a little shady they waited so long to bring this up and then they went behind my back and asked the realtor to call my mom like they didn't believe me even though there were court documents to prove. 

I have a good relationship with my mom but what if I didn't? There is a reason why my grandmother wanted me to handle this instead of my mom. 

That could be a huge ordeal if I did not have a good relationship with my mom. 

Anyone experience with this type of thing or have any thoughts? Do I need to provide this? 

Because they waited until a Friday it's too late to contact the estate attorney that wrote her will now and ask questions.

t3_1fqcsxp,"Bought a Property, found out that seller did not abide by closing agreement.  Similar experience/suggestions?","I bought a home in 2020, with two structures (think in-law apartment) on the property. Separate electric, plumbing, walls, parking etc for both. 

Part of the closing agreement was that the seller would connect to public sewer, from the failing septic for both structures. 

The seller contracted a construction company that connected one of the structures to public sewer, the other was left on septic, unknowingly. The plumber connected to the wrong pipe. The construction company did not have access to the home to check the drains at the time of the work, house was vacant. 

I did not find out until 3 years later with a $3000 sewage backup from the existing septic tank. 

Seller signed a septic abandonment clause, I cannot pull a septic permit to have the work remedied and it’s about $5-7k to have the issue resolved. 

Has anyone had any similar experience?

Would title insurance cover this?

Does anyone have any suggestions? I had a brief conversation with an attorney who suggested pursuing the plumber as an option but was not definitive and it was not hired counsel, more of an informal conversation. 

Any suggestions/advice appreciated. Seller has been unresponsive. 

Edit to add:

Construction company took the “whoopsies” approach and shrugged it off. Seller also documented she had been regularly servicing both septic tanks, and knew both were there. When initially confronted she denied responsibility. 

Cost of civil pursuit would likely just about equal cost of making the repair myself. "

t3_1fq7z1c,Urgent property tax issue! Would seller financing be an option?,"My dad is disabled. He owns a house and lived in it until he suddenly became disabled and was no longer able to climb stairs and the bedroom and bathroom were on the second floor. They moved into a rental and used the income from renting their house to pay their rent. They were receiving a senior exemption and they were unaware that they were not entitled to receive that if they could no longer live in the house. In July, the county tax assessor let them know that they owed $16,000 in back taxes due August 1. When this amount was not paid by Sept 1st they added a 20% collection fee and 12% interest and just five weeks later the amount due is $6000 more so that they owe $22,000. They live on a fixed income and can’t pay these taxes. If they sell the home, they’ll need every dollar of their equity to subsidize and be able to continue to pay their rent. They need to sell quickly, but can’t afford to sell below market value and they are worried about these taxes quickly consuming every dollar they have in equity! Looking for ideas! 

As a realtor, I have fielded seller financing offers. The last one I received offered market value for the house, payment of all commissions plus closing costs and a balloon payment after seven years. no one at my brokerage has experience with these kind of deals and they seem very risky for the seller if the buyer defaults. Is this even an option for my parents since they have a mortgage for about $72,000 and they owe taxes that are currently $22,000? seems the county is determined to extract all of the equity in the home as quickly as possible! Adding these kind of penalties so quickly just doesn’t even seem legal! At this rate, by the time they sell the house, will be lucky if they have any equity at all!

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Has anyone had any successful seller financing deals where the buyer paid faithfully and did not default?"
t3_1fq4ofs,I’m starting to think building is preferable to buying right now.  [AK],"Alaska still has plenty of cheapish land and I don’t need a big house.  After doing a lot of comparisons it looks like a better option financially is to build especially with all the realtor commissions and closing costs.  Looking into things, most of the property in my area qualifies for a rural development loan.  I’ve  gotten a lot of push back from family and friends saying things like it will take longer, it’s too complicated, etc but there is a housing shortage and people are asking crazy prices for what basically are sh*t shacks.

The only thing I can think of that will be a real issue is finding a contractor to build a small modest house for a lower price since they all seem to want to build 3-5bdr homes for $500k+ since that is where the money is but I’m sure if I look hard enough I can find SOMEONE who does small houses.

Thoughts?"

t3_1fqabnv,Delinquent Tax?,"Theres a property near my partners parents, we are expecting and we thought this abandoned property would be a perfect fit. 

From my understanding if you pay a delinquent tax, and the person responsible fails to pay it in time, you acquire the property. You just have to keep up with the taxes. Now if they do pay their taxes, you just receive your money back.

We noticed it was in an estate, so I went to the office to ask about that. However when I went down to our county office, they made it seem like it was illegal for me to acquire a property that way, through taxes. They said They put foreclosure up for auction and thats like the only way I can try to acquire an abandoned property… I have heard of plenty of people doing delinquent taxes here recently. 

To me it seemed like they were just trying to wait it out to acquire the land themselves. 

Any information? I live in NC if that helps.

I appreciate all of the help and information, especially resources and examples. I was definitely misinformed! We are going to look for auctions in our county and try to reach the deceaseds family directly. "

We are looking at the lot in the bottom left corner. We would not own the path to the street, but it is included as an easement through the property in front of us. It is not a shared driveway, they have their own driveway. In fact it is already roughed out as a driveway with electrical poles ran and the lot is somewhat cleared.

t3_1fqfsij,How often should my agent communicate with me. ,"

I am the seller. I put my house on the market with a broker almost two weeks ago. So far, I’ve had 5 showings. My broker only showed one of them, the remaining 4 were from buyer’s agent. My broker told me to download the app HouseByShow to keep track of showings and feedbacks. She hasn’t initiated any text or phone calls regarding my house. I was the one who reached out to her after the first week and she did give me a run down of the feedbacks but referred me to the app. Going onto end of week 2 and no communication. Is this normal? Is she just going to initiate communication when there is an offer ? Or wait for a while to reevaluate the price? What should I do? She is co-listing with another broker and he took the pictures of my house. Honestly they were not good pictures. They were dark and blurry and didn’t highlight the features of my house. I had to ask him to use a picture that I took for the first picture, because his was too dark. 

Should i hire a professional photographer? Is it too late for that? Who should cover the cost of that? I don’t want to get off to a bad start, but I regret using them. "

t3_1fpbw80,Sellers lied about solar panels being paid off and now refusing any solution,"UPDATE: 9/27/24
they are now trying to give us only 3k credit. Opinions?
—————————————————————————————

(from Long Island, NY) We are first time home buyers in the worst situation. The contract is already signed and the seller always told our agent that the solar panels were paid off.
Turns out they lied and there was a lien on the home and the panels went into bankruptcy because they couldn't afford them. They were leased to own so they had to pay monthly till they own them. To outright buy the panels it's 14k. (a ucc3 was filed and the LIEN IS REMOVED)

Mind you they are 10 years old. Why would we want additional debt on old panels.

We don't know what to do, they refuse to credit us in any way. The contract has been signed and we don't want to lose our deposit of 50k because they outright lied about owning the panels. Also in our contract it says

""60. (delete if not applicable) In the event there are currently solar panels installed on the house the buyers) agree to take the premises in its existing condition and will assume the responsibility of the monthly payments for the duration of the contract under its current terms and conditions and/or Lease Transter Agreement. If the title company requires a OCC Financing Statement Amendment (Form UCC3) to be file prior to closing to clear any existing liens subject to the solar panels, the buyer agrees to sign any documents required by the solar panel company to effectuate said transfer of the existing contract into the buyer's name.”

the lawyer and my agent told us that this is normal since we want to own them, and we didn't think much of it since we were told they were paid off.

After weeks of arguing with the sellers my lawyer emailed me the attached. What should we do?

Email:

This is the current scenario...
1. To payoff the panels, and own them outright, the price would be around $14,500
2. To payoff the next year service would be around $6,500
3. If you chose not to utilize the service and activate the panels, your cost would be $0 (you could remove the panels at any time without a fee to Sunrun)
I suspect that in the very near future, the seller will issue a Time of the Essence letter and try to force us to close.
At that time, our options would be the following:
1. Agree to close and elect one of the options above, or,
2. Reject the TOE, under the argument that they misrepresented the balance and costs of the panels.
If you choose the 2nd option, they would likely seek to default us and liquidate the deposit. You would then have to initiate a legal action to dispute their claim.
I cannot guarantee how a court would decide this, but I can tell you that it would be time consuming and costly.
I have informed the seller's attorney that you do not desire to pay anything to Sunrun. I suggested that they issue a credit to you. They have refused.

We are at an impasse.




EDIT:

this is the current correspondence between the lawyers 

Lance- my lawyer

Gerri - sellers lawyer.


Gerri: 
Lance,
Your client signed a contract agreeing to assume the balance of the solar contract. I’m not aware of the discussions that took place between the parties, however Buyer should not be relying on any representations made by the agents or the sellers and are responsible for doing their own due diligence. 
Additionally, the solar panels were not operating at the time of contract, which is the same condition they are in now. 

If the seller owned them outright, then there wouldn’t be a monitoring or servicing agreement, so your client would still be responsible for purchasing a plan. 

Additionally, sun run advised that your client has continuously stated that they want nothing to do with the solar panels  

What is the resolution your client is looking for here? 

Lance:
I’ve said this several times. 

They do not want to accept these panels with any balance due upon them, as was represented to them. 

Your client can provide a credit to the buyers for the cost of the panels, which would put the buyers in the position that they would have been if your client’s representations were accurate. 

They want nothing more than what they bargained for. 

Gerri:

What they bargained for? What about the terms of the contract that they reviewed, signed and agreed to? 

Please clarify, is buyer requesting:
A credit for the estimated pre-payment of solar use for the remainder of the of the term which is $6184 and includes the monitoring and maintenance plan; or 
A credit for outright purchase of the equipment which is $14,187 and does not include a monitoring and maintenance plan (This is essentially what exists now at no cost to anyone since it was discharged in bankruptcy)


Lance:
Option 2.

Gerri:
Your clients are trying for a money grab at this point. The result of option 2 would put them in the same situation as presently exists. Solar panels on roof with no monitoring or maintenance contract. 

Lance:
Or, would allow them to renew the contract, pay the service fees, and utilize the panels. 

They are not looking for more than they negotiated for. 

Your client can also elect to terminate this contract and return the deposit, if they wish. 


End of emails.

The only proof we have is a email from the sellers lawyer admitting that he was trying to obtain a payoff letter but found out theirs bankruptcy.

Their lawyers email:
Lance,
After not having success in obtaining the payoff and UCC3 and in further speaking with the sellers, we are advised that both the 2d mortgage and solar panels were discharged as part of a bankruptcy which sellers didn't previously disclose to us as they interpreted this to mean that both accounts were satisfied. We are requesting a lien release from BofA and have submitted a request to the bankruptcy department at Sunrun to determine what our options are to proceed. The solar agreement was a Power Purchase Agreement through 4/1/2035. Would buyer's consider assuming the solar agreement? I don't believe we will have sufficient funds to payoff the solar loan.

I understand a lot of those types of buildings are zoned commercial. So finding one that’s in a duel zoned area is tricky. 
The main reasoning for this idea is the space and lot size of these 
How feasible is it?

I was told that excavation is extremely expensive. Before I put an offer, realistically how much should I expect to excavate around 1100 sq feet and build a 250 sq ft room/bathroom? It would be nice to understand the cost in the near future before I commit to it. "
t3_1fqeeum,Selling dad's house after his death,"My dad died a couple of months ago and I immediately had several people interested in buying his house. It's very small and needs a lot of work so I'm selling it ""as is""  by myself. The estate is in probate and my dad didn't have a will so I had to wait until I was made administrator to sell. 

One person looked at it before I got that and was interested. After I was made admin, I had an appraisal done by a realtor so I let a couple of other people know that I was ready to show the house. He appraised the house at 68k with the lowest I should go at 60. If I decided to have the realtor sell it, he'd list it for 79 so I went with 70 as an asking price in hopes that I'd at least get the 68. 

As I should have, I didn't let the first person that looked at it know the price for some reason, and another just that I was ready for him to see the house. However, the second person I actually showed to offered to buy for the 70 I asked and we filled out a buyer's agreement as it was the best deal I thought I'd get and I'm pretty sure of that.  As I said, the house needs a lot of work. 

I'm just trying to figure out how, or if, I need to tell these other people that I've already sold. Everything has gone so quick and I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just glad to be rid of that house that I had no desire in keeping. 

Thoughts please.

I cracked public lien records and haven't found anything out of the ordinary. Also will likely be doing a title search or consulting with real estate attorney. Based on similar age homes of that builder in the neighborhood I can pretty accurately estimate the amount of money it will cost to renovate and replace things like AC roof etc. I have a background in management of construction/renovation as does my dad and also have a cabinetry company and resources to get everything done right and for the right price.

We can afford a home up to 700k but I'd like to spend less. Gone are the days where you can have contingencies on your home selling so I'm sure that's out the window. 

My plan is to take the proceeds from my house and throw it as downpayment for the new home. A friend mentioned a bridge loan, I'd need to look into that but I was wondering what other folks have done in similar situation.

Roofer comes out and says there is excessive granular loss in the shingles, cracks, missing pieces, evidence of repair patches, and quite a bit of hail damage. Says the sellers should try to file for a claim with their home insurance due to presence of significant hail damage for a new roof.

We are going into negotiations next and will be planning to ask for concessions. Roofer told me it’ll be difficult for us to get home insurance, or have insurance drop us pretty quickly with the state of the roof. Also same thing with the lender- due to the roof state. Selling agent says sellers are going through a divorce, don’t want to do repairs, and they have a backup offer. I’m thinking unless the back up offer is all cash, this would be a similar problem moving forward. Sellers did not disclose age of roof (says they don’t know) or any repairs done in the sale disclosure. But did mention to us that she had a roofer go up there quite recently (in the last couple years) to repair some things and said the roof was in good condition.

t3_1fqagyb,Possible Seller Credit Opinions ,"Coming to the pros of Reddit for their opinions on this matter, hoping to see if anyone else has had something similar.

In the midst of purchasing a home and under contract, everything is moving swiftly (knock on wood). Part of the acceptance of our offer was agreeing to the inspection being informational aside from any structural, environmental or hazardous issues. We were OK with this given the place was in good shape and we did not want to lose out. We understood the AC system was older, but figured it's OK since we do not want to lose the place by not agreeing. During inspection it was brought to attention that the AC coils and handler had no drain pan and were not up to code (located in attic above the master) nor mounted correctly. Also, there was some original fiberglass duct work still.

Given that the AC coils and handler are not installed properly and show signs of prior leakage with no drain pan we feel this presents a hazard which can also lead to structural issues. If the unit were to leak it could cause mold and significant drywall damage/caving. Is there a case to ask for some seller credit in this instance given the situation given how these issues were presented or not so much ? The condenser being original and needing replacement we understand and are not looking for credit there.

t3_1fqenn7,Financially manipulated or would I have qualified? ,"Hi all. This concern has been weighing on my mental health and kept me in depression for years.

Newly wed couple in California, Dec 2020. wanted to buy house in 2021. father convinced me i wouldn’t qualify, Told me I didn’t have a LLC with consistent income over 2 years. 

He instead convinced me to give him $150k, he bought a 2nd house for $900k in Jan 2021 at a beautiful rate, which is worth over $1.7M now. 

We’re stuck renting, my income dropped since I got obsessed with this issue and lost self esteem being a renter in my line of work.

2019: $180k. W2 $7k.

2020: $378k. W2 $100k. Rest is S-Corp distribution.

2021: $160k. W2 $100k. Rest is S-Corp distribution.

Had 2 companies, moved clients to 2nd one: 
- company 1 started in Jan 2019, stopped receiving income on Sep 2020. Closed in Dec 2022.
- Company 2 started in March 2020, started receiving income on September 2020.

I was seriously considering two different properties, one of which was a new building with all units being affordable housing.

Before I let it go I had my mortgage broker send me some estimates on my monthly rate. He gave rates two different times. Now that I am back to looking I saw a property I am interested in and I am going to look at it and again I asked my mortgage broker for another estimate. My question is: how many times have you had a mortgage broker do an estimate? Do they seem annoyed if it’s too many?

For those who have done something similar, what’s the best way to coordinate the sale of your current home while house-hunting in a new city? Any tips for timing, logistics, or avoiding stress during the process?

Thanks for your insights!

t3_1fq8yzl,To sell or not to sell,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub but I have a house I bought for 305k a year ago. 4 bed, 2 bath, hot tub above ground pool with huge deck surrounding in Springtown TX. The problem now is it’s too far away from my boyfriend’s kids school. About 45 minutes one way. With them in sports it’s about 4 hours in the car every day and we don’t get home until 930-10pm every night. Obviously I still owe a lot of money on it. My question is would it be smarter to sell the house and take the loss or try and rent it out? I have a va loan and feel free to ask me any other questions. I am at such a loss as what to do and I’m so conflicted and confused. My boyfriend wants to rent something closer and buy after we get married but going from homeownership back to renting breaks my heart. Any advice or similar stories would be greatly appreciated. "

t3_1fp8c75,Buyer Agent did a 180 once I switched from her recommended lender,"
I’ve been working with my realtor while looking at homes and everything was great at first. She recommended a lender but also encouraged me to shop around. I ended up getting prequalified with her lender with a conventional loan, but the rate was higher, so I found a lower rate FHA loan with a broker. Since I chose the broker, my realtor has changed her attitude, giving the broker a hard time with choosing not to communicate with him, and when she does, it is passive aggressive from what the broker has told me.

She argues that I have better chances with a conventional loan with the lender she recommended and blames my FHA for our unsuccessful offers (2 so far). I’m starting to question if she’s actually right, especially since I know FHA loans have stricter rules. However, I feel her behavior isn’t warranted; she should be advocating for me more even with this loan being perceived as inferior to a conventional. I’m unsure if I should let her take the lead with following her recommendations, after all she’s the expert and I’m not, or if this attitude is unacceptable and I should start the process with ending our contract. Every exchange we have makes my blood pressure rise but I want to be sure if she’s right. 

If it matters, I wasn’t really sure how I got the conventional in the first place as my credit is sub 700.

EDIT: thank you all for all your info! I have decided to inquire with my broker on a conventional loan. As for my agent, I just sent the metaphorical break up message. She did acknowledge that it’s been a rocky journey. 

EDIT 2: a lot of people aren’t reading my update on switching to the conventional loan. So here I am again, I GET IT, FHA is inferior to conventional, although not impossible I know it is a huge challenge. I have switched loans already. My agent and I had a long talk about the approach and future expectations, you can read in my comments where she was lacking, it wasn’t just the FHA situation, she WAS getting fired but we talked it out and have put an offer on a home using conventional loan, hope we go under contract soon now that my broker, agent and I can work with each other and not against. Thanks again!!"

t3_1fq88is,Leaving our house furnished,"I just wanted to make sure I’m not missing some worst case scenario that’s worse than what I’m imagining.

Our home in Fruita, CO is listed and is being offered furnished. Obviously that option will not appeal to a lot of buyers, but it might to the one we get. We hoped to get an offer before moving, but unexpectedly are moving next Tuesday instead of 10/29. We are moving across the country and will not have room for all of the furniture.

Everything that would be left behind is nice enough to use (even if it’s just temporarily) or sell for some $ on FaceBook marketplace. There is nothing that is truly junk and would warrant haul off. Nor is there a lot of stuff that would take several hours to clear out.

Now I do understand that is an opinion and it is possible a buyer would disagree. Is there a worse outcome that I’m not picturing than said buyer taking us to small claims to pay a junk haul off bill? 

*It is a 3/2 1550 sq ft starter home priced at 417.5K if that matters in any way shape or form. Most of our showings have been to younger families (like ourselves) that would be getting into their first home. I know I would have been thrilled to get all this stuff for “free” when I was in those shoes."
t3_1fq7tkt,Recourse for bank holding onto property for more than two years?,"There is a property that we’ve looked at when it’s been listed for 7 years now. We bid on it back when it went on auction in 2017, but they wanted too much. It’s been left to rot, and it looks like whenever it’s been more than two years, they sell it for some amount to another mortgage company and then weeks later buy it back for 0 dollars. One of the banks involved is Citi who apparently was fined 30M for this in 2019. We want to make a fair offer for it, but it is quite dilapidated after years of neglect, and they want even more than what the reserve was back then. We offered something low thinking they would work with us to find a middle number, and they went down less than 5k. Has anyone had success prying a property like this away from the bank for an amount that makes sense? It’s got such great potential, and it’s a shame for it to just rot."
t3_1fq7out,Foreclosure or Probate?,"I'm going to try and keep this short and sweet as possible... (Questions at bottom)

My relative's daughter passed away, and unbeknownst to him, she was in default on her mortgage (for what seems to be for 6 years) and the lender began filing foreclosure documents May 1, 2024.  She was sick and was on disability, which I'm assuming wasn't enough for her to live.  She died unexpedectly earlier this week and she died intestate.

  
Below is basic information I pulled from copies of her deed, mortgage, and foreclosure documents filed by the lender.

**Lender:** United States Department of Agriculture – Rural Housing Service  
**Mortgage Date:** December 2, 1998  
**Maturity Date:** December 2, 2031  
**Mortgage Amount:** $80,775.00  
**Monthly Payment:** $475.52  
**Interest Rate:** 6.125%  
**Foreclosure Balance:** $168,358.27 (+ $13.13 per diem, attorney fees &amp; court fees)  
**Current Estimate of House:** $190,000.00 (Based on internet search)

From the Summons and Complaint filed by the lender:  
""...there is now due and owing and unpaid Note and Mortgage the **principal amount of $78,264.42, plus accrued interest from February 2, 2018 through April 30, 2024, in the amount of $29,931.20, plus subsidy granted in the amount of $43,214.84, plus late charges in the amount of $318.03, plus escrow impounds in the amount of $2,12.48, plus advanced property preservation and escrow in the amount of $14,505.30, for a total balance of $168,358.27**, together with pre-judgement interest at per diem of $13.13, with reasonable sum as attorney’s fees and costs of this action.""  


Based on information from the mortgage, this loan was granted pursuant to 42 USC §§ 1490A. In which I found the following...

**42 USC §§ 1490A**  
Title 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE  
CHAPTER 8A - SLUM CLEARANCE, URBAN RENEWAL, AND FARM HOUSING  
SUBCHAPTER III - FARM HOUSING  
Sec. 1490a - Loans to provide occupant owned, rental, and cooperative housing for low and moderate income, elderly or handicapped persons or families.

  
Ok... Here are my questions...

1. Should we contact the lender to let them know of her death?  
2. Is there a chance the lender would work with her father to see if there is a way to ""save"" the mortgage/become in good standing again? Maybe by paying the accrued interest and then resume regular payments?  
3. If so and he goes through probate and takes over the mortgage, would he have to pay subsidy right then? Or when he sells the house? (There is a subsidy agreement on her promissory note.)  
3. Is there no point and we should just let it foreclose and not file probate? (The deceased had nothing else other than her home.) 



Long story short... My goal here is to see if the mortgage can be saved, so he could sell it after probate was finalized to have him a nice nest egg to live on.  But, my gut tells me there's no point and to just let the foreclosure happen.

t3_1fq2965,Is it reasonable to make an offer with a very delayed close and a vacancy condition?,"There is a house on the market that I am very interested in. It has been on the market for 70 days (which is unusually long for my area) and has current tenants living in it.

The current tenants lease goes through May 2025 which is actually ideal for us because we have kids in school and would prefer to not move until after the school year ends (they'll be changing districts).

I am, however, unwilling to close on a house with current tenants given all the risks involved with that ( I live in CA- a very tenant friendly state, and I have heard too many horror stories). 

Fantasy scenario is that we make an offer that both:
A. Delays closing until May 2025 and
B. Makes closing contingent on the house being both vacant and in equal or better condition as when we went into contract.

Is this doable or completely unreasonable? Risks I may not be considering? "

t3_1fpwavv,Removing HVAC - Foreclosure - Homeowner Deceased,"I have a relative who took out a loan though his bank for a HVAC unit for his daughter's home.  She was making the payments, but unexpectedly passed away earlier this week.  Unbeknownst to her father, she has been in default for several years and the lender began foreclosure proceedings on her house in May 2024 and it has not been finalized.

In South Carolina, HVAC units are ""fixtures"" to the property and stay with the property when it is sold. But the property hasn't been taken back by the lender yet.

Can my relative remove the HVAC system from her house?  The deceased purchased it in full (with the loan) so isn't the unit technically hers?

Either way, the father is going to begin payments since it is technically his loan.

t3_1fpzmuf,Buyers Representation when viewing with a listing agent. PLEASE HELP!,"In light of the recent NAR settlement, I have started finding the listing agents of properties that my wife and I are interested in and setting up showings ourselves without a buyers agent. Many of the listing agents have requested us to start signing exclusive buyers representation agreements, most for just a day (or other short period of time) or just that property. The problem arises when we see multiple properties in a week and there are multiple agreements that may accidentally overlap. Are we required to show the listing agent our buyers agreement? Can we just say that we won't be touring with a buyers agent or that we will be self representing? Research on the bills themselves from the various government is hard to find a definitive answer and personally, I take NAR ""settlement 101 articles"" with a grain of salt.

For context, it isn't that I disagree with all commissions for buyers agents, but I generally disagree that it should be a flat percentage of the home as was traditional before the settlement. That seems to be the wrong incentive for me as a buyer. I've participated in half a dozen real estate transactions, so at this point, buying real estate doesn't necessarily intimidate me. Has anyone come across buyers agreements that incentivize the buyers agent to work down the price or monthly payment?

TL;DR - Do you need a buyers agent agreement to see a home with a listing agent? Can I say that we will be self representing and sign an affidavit saying as much.?

  
EDIT: I am specifically looking at properties in IL and IN, but often this claim I need a buyers agreement is because of a ""federal law"""

So even though we love our neighbors we sell. 
We closed yesterday  and we realized the buyers are making it a rental property!!! 
They are doing a bit of construction adding a bathroom  and using it as an investment. 
I just feel so guilty. I feel bad for my neighbors we came to love. 
Like this neighborhood  was either first owners built in the 50s or 2nd owners young families. 
I just seriously  pray the right person rents it long term and it's a good  fit. 
I know logically  absolutely  nine of this is my concern  but I feel really bad. 

edit
I'm not hating on renters I used to live In government  housing, then rented forever. 
If it wasn't for my husband's credit and down payment I'd never have a house. 
I love the idea of people renting houses to people because both parties win.

I hope he does well with it.

t3_1fpzihn,Typical Agent Experience ? ,"Hi all,

I'm based in Adelaide, Australia, and I own a property valued at approximately $1.1 million. Recently, I purchased another property off-market for $1.45 million. The agent who sold us this property, in my opinion, pressured us into using him as the selling agent for our current home.

Initially, he quoted a commission rate of 1.8% with a $5,500 marketing fee for a three-week campaign. I pushed back, saying the rate was too high and unfair, so he reduced it to 1.6%. The issue is that we were supposed to be executing the Form 1 for our new property, but he refused to proceed unless we signed the contract for him to run the campaign on our existing property.

I’m feeling quite anxious about the whole situation and would appreciate some honest feedback. Am I being taken advantage of here? Or should I be grateful that his poor performance for another vendor resulted in a cheaper purchase for us?

I’ve done the calculations, and assuming we get the market value for our property, he’s set to make around $30,000 for three weeks' work, which mostly involves opening the door a few times.

Is this a common real estate experience, or am I getting ripped off? Is it also common to feel super anxious when selling your home? "

t3_1fprpyz,AZ Real Estate Exam,"After completing my licensing exam I figured I’d give you my thoughts and ideas about the 3 tests you must complete to start your journey in Real Estate

90 Hour Pre Licensing Course: 
I took my course through Aceable agent which was all online. I thought the course was very simple to use and I enjoyed watching the videos and being able to listen to the chapters. The class itself was very simple and straight forward. In my opinion they teach you all what you need to know for the tests. 

The test: 
(I had an earlier post regarding this because I was terrified of taking this test as you only have 2 attempts before you are required to restart the class) The test itself was very easy. I had taken the practice tests on the class website 4 times. Each test being 180 questions long. I also took the smaller practice tests for each chapter (I believe 27 chapters) 3 times each. Along with the Prep Agent website. I passed on my first try with an 83%. Had I not changed a few answers at the end I would’ve had a 90+. But a pass is a pass! 

The Writing Contract Test:
I took this test shortly after the final course exam so that everything was still fresh. With this test as you may know it is unlimited attempts. There was virtually nothing to really study besides the study guide given to you. Having no real practice tests it was difficult to really study as the study guide is a mere 6 pages long full of definitions you already learned. Because I had studied so hard for my first test I figured I’d be able to pass this test first try. I was wrong.. I went in blind and failed the test with a 76% as it is only 25 questions and you must receive a 80% percent to pass. I took the test again a few minutes later and passed. Helpful hints: pay attention to the wording and know your definitions of easements, time, possession trust, trustee, trustor etc.. Wasn’t very difficult in all honesty

The License Exam:
For this test I figured I’d just study again through Prep Agent, Aceable Agent. I repeated the same process by taking the tests over and over again memorizing the questions and answers. As the test date was approaching I went on Pearson Vue and decided to spend the $20 to take their practice test. It is 80 questions and only 1 test. There is only 1 test form as well. I took it after receiving high grades on my other study tests and received a 62/80. It tells you what categories to focus on and what you scored in those categories but doesn’t tell you what answers you got wrong. A took it again and received a 75%. Figured I was good to go on the actual test now. I studied and studied all the way up till the exam. Walked in to the testing center and was shitting bricks. I was stunned with what was on the test. I felt so unprepared. Even after spending a week and a half solely studying for 6 hours a day. The wording was much different from anything I’ve seen before on my other practice tests. It took me 4.5 hours to finish because I reviewed the test 4 times. 195 question test x 4 . Each time I went over a question I was more confident in my answer.. I scored a 66%. Again the rest doesn’t tell you what answers were wrong or right just what you scored on categories. Boy was I bummed. I went back to studying the next day. This time with a different approach. I read somewhere on here that a website called The Night Before The Exam was very good to study so I tried that along with Prep Agent. Swapping back and forth between the 2. I spent another week studying 6 hours a day. I took the second test with much more confidence and did it under an hour and a half.. Failed with a 74%. Bummed was an understatement but I was soo close. I buckled up my studying and was able to review my last test on the answers I got wrong. Took my 3rd test 2 days after my 2nd. It was much harder than any other test I had previously. It was as if every difficult question I’ve had were all thrown into 1 test. During the test I thought to myself “ I definitely bombed this test “ Long story short. I somehow managed to pass! 

Highlights: Prep Agent I found was useful. Not perfect but very useful. The Night Before the Exam was extremely helpful in the wording and understanding of topics. And lastly if you have the money for it I would suggest taking the Pearson Practice Exam a couple times so that you are familiar with the wording in the actual test. Good luck and thanks for reading!

t3_1fptpda,Question: can I just call the seller's broker to see what the seller has authorized them to offer as compensation to the buyer's agent? ,"Pre-NAR settlement, back in January, we'd occasionally see houses with an agent.  Only once did we make an offer on a house and when we did, we signed an exclusive agreement with the agent specific to that property and stating the agent would be paid from the seller's agent's commissions.  Offer was ultimately rejected. 

Post NAR-settlement: last weekend we went to open house (agent wasn't there) and liked what we saw.  We reached out to agent and said can you make an offer.  Agent sent an exclusive agreement for 90 days for all properties in the county requiring us to pay 3% of purchase price to extent not paid from the seller's agent's commissions.  (I get the broader terms since the agent can't take us to tour properties without a signed document). 

That is a very different compensation model.  And honestly, I think my willingness to pay that depends on the new market consensus around what sellers are authorizing their agents to offer as compensation to the buyer's agent.    
  
**Question**: can I just call the seller's broker to see what the seller has authorized them to offer as compensation to the buyer's agent?  If they are offering 2-3% then I feel much better singing the agent's proposed buyer's agreement. "

I have the document and now that I look closer the leasing agent NEVER signed them after we turned them in to, in return, screw me over if my brother ever wanted me out without saying anything to me. He’s said a spew of lies like i was a squatter and things yet I have the proof of payments to him for every month I was there. My main question is, is this legal that he just didn’t sign them? This agents exact words were “it never went through.” I didn’t get it exactly at the time because of the crazy situation I found myself in, but with that said I have the documents of at least both me and my brother agreeing at that time and it being signed and submitted over 6 months ago. I have contacted a city attorney for what they call a special order made to be given to the police to then escort me back into the apartment and regain access. So, before I waste these cops time, do I have every right to re enter and confront this dumb agent or better yet the property manager/owner to reactivate my key? I’ve never heard of this type of stuff, nor do I get involved with legal issues in general hence me reaching out to this subreddit. Any advice moving forward with this would help, thank you guys."
t3_1fppdr6,Is it worth it to buy a condo with a low reserve (with an impending special assessment) even at a great deal? ,"Hubby and I made an offering on a condo ( a fixer upper) which we had to overbid to win it but is still priced reasonably. However, after the inspection, it seems that it would require a bit more work than we had thought to put it back to habitable condition. Also, after going through the HOA package, it is mentioned there might be an impending special assessment to repair the common areas as the HOA has a very low reserve (reserve study was done in 2022 but no action has been taken yet to collect these dues). Would it therefore worth it to get this condo or could there be more unforeseeable challenges that might pop up in the future? We also planned to get on board  with the HOA to make sure things get done as they should be, would that be worth it all? "

He is also pulling out the initial escrow payments due to him believing it was paid with GI Bill money. My loan officer has not heard of this either and is so confused as to what this underwriter is referring to. We know Gi Bill money does not count as income for a mortgage loan, which we did not even disclose we receive. We qualified for a 600k home on our income and are using GI bill money as supplementary income and using it to pay any closing costs which my loan officer has no problem with. Either way what difference does the money coming from matter? It can’t be said what money is being used for what once it gets it gets deposited so we don’t understand what this underwriters issue is? does anyone know of anything like this? "
t3_1fq1ov5,Thoughts from a broker/agent,"I’m a real estate broker in Utah and I’ve followed this thread. I love hearing stories, although it seems like there are a lot of horror stories. I had some thoughts I wanted to share… 

#1 - I always felt like, as a real estate agent, I was respected. I help people navigate what is usually the largest financial transaction of their life. In following this thread, I can see a lot of people feel like real estate agents are slimy, shady, overpaid and overall similar to a used car salesman. Yes, there are a lot of bad agents. There are agents that are not worth what they’re paid…but also, there are a lot of really good agents. Do your research! Interview multiple agents when you’re searching for someone to represent you. I feel like my job, as an agent, is to make the transaction as smooth as possible and ensure my clients are protected and their best interests are always first. I frequently use the commission I’m paid to help facilitate this. I have paid off buyers’ tax liens so they could close/qualify (they said they’d pay me back, but they never did - which is fine, I still made money). I have paid for repairs out of pocket. I have personally helped clean out houses, clean up yards, haul trash to the dump, etc. I have paid for appraisals to be rushed. Just this week, my clients were buying a home and needed a few extra days for closing. It was inconvenient for the sellers. I asked what I could do to help ease the burden - I ended up hiring a junk removal company to help clear out a shed and garage that the sellers were having a hard time. I made their life easier so they were willing to make my client’s (and my) life easier. I have reduced my commission when the appraisal came in low. I don’t say this to toot my own horn or say how awesome I am - I say it because if you’re agent isn’t going above and beyond to make the process easier for you, they should be. I get its hard/impossible to fire an agent mid-transaction, and sometimes you find out how bad of an agent you’re tied to until it’s too late. But interview lots of agents, ask them what they’ve done with other clients to ensure a smooth transaction. There are really great agents out there.

#2 - Real estate laws are VERY state specific and also VERY contract specific. It’s sometimes difficult to give good advice on here without knowing your state. Your agent should be an expert in your state. There are a lot of federal laws, but there are a multitude more state specific laws.

#3 - In most states, there are real estate brokers &amp; real estate agents. Real estate brokers are agents how have taken additional education, training and experience. Agents work under brokers. If you have a problem with your agent, don’t be afraid to involve the broker. Broker &gt; agent. Your listing agreement or buyer/broker agreement should list the broker. As a broker, if I get a call from an agent’s client, it gets my attention really quick.

#4 - Mostly everything is negotiated/negotiable. This includes commissions. There is no standard. There is no normal. Yes, typically it falls within 1-3%. There are agents who will only work for 3%. They may say “I know my worth”. Everyone is able to conduct their business how they want. Personally, I have and would never let my commission influence any decision I make in a transaction. Currently, with the recent changes, I will say: My fee is 3%. This is most commonly paid by the seller, but not always. In any offer, we will ask the seller to cover the fee. If they agree to an amount less, I’ll take whatever they’re offering and I won’t force you to cover the difference.” Every agent is different. If you aren’t satisfied with the agent’s response to commissions/compensation, keep interviewing. You will find an agent willing to work for whatever fee you’re happy paying. Yes, you could “get what you pay for”, but I think you can find really good agents that are willing to make the numbers work…. Which brings me to 5.

#5 - Are agents overpaid? Sometimes. There are transactions that go super super easy and smooth and I’ve been paid 3% and I’ve felt like my compensation far outweighed the number of hours I worked. On the flip side, there are times I’ve worked for months and month, showed 30+ homes, written 5+ offers, spent hours and hours, nights &amp; weekends, away from my family…and been paid $0. It’s part of the business. Some are easy. Some are really hard. Compensation doesn’t always align with how hard or how much I worked. Not sure what the solution is. Some agents do work on an hourly rate, some on a flat rate, and some on a percentage. Find an agent who you feel comfortable with."

t3_1fpikf7,Anxious tenant here: if our property manager wants our rental appraised could it be bad for us?,"Rental tenant in Oregon here. We got a text saying that someone was coming by to appraise the property soon, my roommates and I are anxious about what that could potentially mean for us.



We can't find a whole lot of information about this online from the perspective of tenants, mostly from the perspective of property owners. So I thought I would ask you all what it could mean for tenants in your experience.

  
For the record we have no intention of denying the appraiser access. Our anxiety is that the property manager wants the house appraised so that they can sell it and potentially evict us. We've been living at the property for about 5 years and always pay our rent so I don't believe we meet the criteria that would allow them to evict us without cause. But then again we're not exactly lawyers so we don't know how this works. 

  
We tried asking our property managers about this but they were sort of cagey about it, said ""they have no more information available at this time."" Which made us way more worried than we were originally. 

  
So in your experience are there scenarios where this could lead to us being evicted? Are there benign scenarios? "

t3_1fpo04z,Does the 5 year rule still apply when you’re paying 80-90% down with cash? Advice on buying or renting temporarily.  ,"I inherited my childhood home (manufactured home on 4.6 acres) when my dad passed away several years ago. Rent is relatively expensive in Boise, ID so I’ve been living here and trying to maintain it (for all the wrong, sentimental reasons). Commuting 40+ minute to and from work, and stressing about things breaking/going wrong is taking its toll on my mental health. I’ve finally committed to selling it and I need to be out of here before the summer. 

Problem: I’m a teaching professor on a yearly contract making ~60k and I don’t know how much longer I’ll stay here. If they don’t renew my contract, I pretty much have to move to an area with biotech or another college. Comps come in at ~425k which I could easily use to buy a nice little place near the university. Prices range from 400-500k for what I want.

t3_1fpemtd,Assuming a VA Loan,"Hey there,

Curious if anyone has any tips here. We’ve fallen in love with a house of our friend’s and they haven’t listed it yet but just announced they are prepping to sell. Generally we’re not desiring to buy just yet in this market but they have a VA loan that they’re willing to let us assume at 2.5% interest rate.

With that rate we’d be really happy to move on it but the difference between the assumable mortgage and sell price would be about 125K.

We’ve been trying to get a second mortgage to cover the 125K which we would be able to pay 20% down on.

Issue is, we’ve called a mortgage broker and several large banks and they’ve told us they don’t want to (maybe aren’t allowed to?) give us this 2nd mortgage.

We’re planning on talking to local credit unions but if that doesn’t work are we out of luck?

Any other ideas from y’all?"

Like the title says, I'm just looking for a quick clarification. Background: I am assisting an elderly person who is looking to sell their home, and he is under the impression that the house would need to be empty before a realtor even sees it for the first time.

I know most people will have the home empty by the time CLOSING comes up, or even in advance of showings depending on the situation, but when it's just a meeting with the realtor, I would think it would be totally fine if there are still items in the house (including some boxes being packed).

t3_1fpcikq,"Discerning possible options for Two Families living on the same property, wondering if we've missed any possibilities? Of the possible options, which is likely to be the most affordable?","So my wife and I (no kids yet) would really like to live on the same property as her sister's family (4 kids), and her sister and our brother-in-law are likewise motivated to make it happen. They would probably need about 5 bedrooms, or 4 and an office, and we would need 3 bedrooms. We would also ideally want a guestroom that both families could offer to guests, and an office space for my brother-in-law at least. We have been brainstorming possible options to make it work, and we have landed on a few, but I am wondering if there is a possibility of which I am not aware? Here is the options we have brainstormed:

1. Buy a 4 or 5 bedroom house, and build an extension so we can fit our family.
2. Find a large \~8 bedroom house and find a way to split it up.
3. Buy a Multifamily home (limited options for our family sizes) and potentially put in a door between the units.
4. Build a house from the ground up with enough bedrooms and bathrooms.
5. Build a modular/factory house.
6. Build a multifamily home from the ground up. 
7. Build a modular/factory Multifamily home (Is this even an option?)
8. Buy a 4 or 5 bedroom house and build an Accessory Dwelling Unit for our family.
9. Buy two homes near each other and call it good enough.

The advantages of a single shared building (options 1-7) are multiple:

* We live in Minnesota, so the heating costs would be less with a shared roof.
* We only really need 1 ""family room"" with a tv, so having a single offering for both families would be excellent.
* We only really need 1 large dining room.
* Shared access to a guest bedroom.
* More distinct rooms for living/playing/reading/being/etc. than if we had separate houses.

My favorite of the above options is #6/7, since we could come up with a design that divides up the rooms in a way that makes sense for the sizes/needs of our two families, and also easily put in doors between the units in logical spots. It would also have decent future proofing, as the other unit could be rented out if one family decided to move long in the future.

Tl;dr: What options can you think of for two families to live together? Which one(s) are liable to be the most affordable?"

- My budget is 200-300k 
- I would love to live somewhere walkable. I don’t have a drivers license or a car because I grew up walking and taking the train everywhere.
- Also a city that’s fun and has cute restaurants and things to do 

BONUS: a big plus is if it’s on the east coast and decent driving/train distance from NYC  "
t3_1fpk24p,Commission to share between agent ,"Hi

I’m a serious buyer and have free legal real estate service from my employer.

I am thinking about staying unrepresented and make an offer with a 12k of concession in a 400k home. I feel like the seller will be ok to pay the concession if they don’t have to pay for my agent.

It may not be the case on some situation like if the seller already agree to pay 5-6% of commission to share between agent. In that case I understand the seller agent will just keep it all. If it’s the case, I prefer to hire my own agent…

Is it ok to ask the seller agent how the commission work? Ask if the seller already agree by contract to pay 5-6% no matter what?

Edit to clarify that it’s not « free » legal service. I’m choosing my own firm but the cost is covered by my legal insurance offer by my employer. "

My last lead who I worked for and drove all around down for left me because they didn’t want to sign the new addendum after the NAR settlement… for whatever reason they were personally offended, even though I explained to them it was not personal and I would make sure they wouldn’t pay commission.

Ideally, I would like to get listings, but I know we all would 😂

Any advice? I live in Florida for reference"

I'm not so concerned I know the property has increased in value since we've purchased it. I just like to know if there is anything I can do or should be looking out for to get as much value out of our home as possible. The basement is completely unfinished and is partially demolished however the upstairs is mainly complete minus trim and our sunroom needs to be joint compounded and painted. The exterior is okay the roof will need to be replaced in the future the siding is old but all intact and I'm in the process of painting the exterior trim around the windows.

t3_1fpdh1x,Neighbor installed fence over property line in2011- do I need to survey to remove? ,"Back in 2011, a neighbor put up some fence (cattle fence) about 20ft over the property line. I was suspicious but let it slide since the land he fenced was unusable. It is a wooded slope. I went out the other day and measured it and found the survey stake when I did. What he had done is measured from my gate at the road which is 20 ft from the road edge. He has never used the property, he had planned to put cows on it but never did. The fence wire has fallen in most places, so it is mostly just fence posts. 

I am considering selling my property and would like to fix the situation before listing. I found the survey stake so I am wondering if I need to have a survey done to force the removal of the fence. If I have to pay for a survey is there any way to make the guy pay for it if he refuses to move it after I show him the error? "
t3_1fpdef5,Trying to sell cigarette smokers house,"We bought a 2300 sq ft house that smelled strongly of cigarette smoke (the previous owner was still smoking in the house during walk through). We hired a professional “smoke remediation” cleaning company to clean the entire first floor and use ozone generators (1500 sq ft). The smell improved but was still strong. We used Zinser BIN two coats on all the walls and then a top coat, new countertops installed, new backsplash, cleaned and BIN painted cabinets, had wood floors and all windows professionally deep cleaned, ducts cleaned, all new lighting put in, and are in the process of cleaning and changing out all outlets. We also did an additional 24 hr ozone treatment, are about to do another one but much shorter. We had an attic fan installed. We also checked the attic insulation and luckily it does not smell. We sealed off the fireplace in case it was contributing to the smoke smell. We are thinking of buying new kitchen appliances too. Right now we’ve put in about $30,000 into all of this cleaning, not including the hours of work we’ve done ourselves. 
All of this and there is still a slight stale cigarette smell remaining. 
I’m at the end of my rope with this house and not sure what to do. It’s making me very depressed and anxious and feeling a lot of regret. We bought it in June and it’s now almost October and I’m unsure if it can be fixed or if we should just try to sell it after only a few months of living here and move on. I don’t want to lose a ton of money by selling it under what we paid for it also having put so much money into it ourselves or then having to sell it for less than we even bought it and only a few months later. 
We were advised that the professional restoration company and special paint would get rid of the smell, and obviously it did not. 
We thought we would be done with cleaning “renovations” in July, but that wasn’t the case. We have a baby on the way in October, so obviously we can’t sell and move this instant but looking for advice on what we should do in a few months. Should we keep trying to remediation the smell or should we start getting the house ready to sell? "

Marie agreed to sell for 200k, the land is valued at 400K. She is borrowing another 600k for the construction on the land. Homes similar to the one she is building go for about 1.5 mill. The closing process took place about a month ago and money has been disbursed by the lender for construction.

Marie now wants to back out with no real reasoning, or explanation. Katie said that the only way would be if Marie sues her.  She has spent plenty of resources to bring this project to a reality and now deed and all are under her name. 

What options does Marie have at this point? My friend does not want to lawyer up unnecessarily early. Just trying to get an idea of what recourse can  Marie pull from?...."

The realtor said they’d send me some paperwork and then I can tour the home. Today, I received a document that would appoint the realtor as my exclusive buyers agent. For context, I live and am looking to buy in a state where dual agency is not allowed. I’m wondering if this is normal? Should I already have a buyers agent before I want to tour a home?

t3_1fplsae,Am I overthinking this or should I get a real estate license?,"So first off, I want to say I have no desire to be a real estate agent or even in the business. I have my own business and a completely different field, and I have more than my hands full with that. Now here’s the thing I was in a relationship with a real estate agent For several years and was able to easily look at houses when I wanted and was never rushed. I’ve bought and sold several homes throughout my life and having a girlfriend in the business, definitely helped. Well we are not together anymore and that proposes some unique challenges. I have a great agent to work with and he is a close friend of mine so I’m not worried about his integrity, but as I am self-aware enough to know, I take my time with major decisions and purchases. My ex and I had probably looked at over 50 houses before I bought the last one. I’m not gonna expect an agent to take me to 50 houses. I get it. But I’m wondering if a solution would be to take the Real Estate test until I pass and then be able to go look at whatever houses I want on my own. Is that how it even works? I Don’t wanna do any deals and understand that I don’t know the business. I know this sounds a little extreme and I would be using my friend to do the deals but if I can take two weeks of my life this winter and dedicate it to getting that license, I feel as if it could make my searching process a lot easier. What say you guys am I totally piped dreaming or is there any merit to what I’m saying?"

t3_1fpjuex,Help me understand mortgage costs and points because I’m feeling misled,"I’m under contract on a home purchase. $825k, 10% down. 

I’ve shopped around 10 lenders and narrowed it down to 2. They were both offering substantially the same terms that interested me, which is a 6.125% rate with a 1/0 buy down   (At no cost) to 5.125% for year 1. And a low-cost one time refinance option. So my plan is to refinance in a year or shortly after, and as such i don’t really want to pay much in points, if at all. 

Lender A told me on 9/20 that to get the 6.125% would cost me $1100 in points

Lender B said the 6.125% would cost me $1,600

I went with a lender A because they were slightly cheaper and the lender whose pre-verification letter is in the offer.

But now as I’m sent the official application to sign and proceed, the loan estimate with Lender A has $3500 in points.

Can things have really changed that much in such a short amount of time? I’m still waiting to hear back from Lender A for an explanation but my initial reaction is to feel like they were or are shady. I’m considering switching lenders (so long as it doesn’t affect the transaction) but not sure if I’m overreacting? "
t3_1fpb8g8,Buyer agent cost ,What should I offer an agent when I’ve already found a house and just need them to make an offer and do what ever needed until I close? 
t3_1fpb88o,Per Diem delay,"I’m currently under contract to close on a new construction home in NC on Sept 26th with an all cash offer. The buyer of my buyer had an underwriting issue and had to switch lenders and needs an extension. They are now saying it will be by Oct 7 at the latest before we can close on our current home in OH and have the funds needed to close in NC. 

Upon hearing that news my buying agent down in NC made it seem like a huge deal and said there were per diem fees involved for any delay. I reread our offer to purchase and addendums again and found nothing referring to per diem. I’ll also note that due to a vacation with someone working for the builder they never sent me instructions on where to send builder deposit so I never sent it. 

My agent reached out to the builders agent and confirmed that there was a per diem fee of $200 per day until we close. Once they heard about the delay and realized I never sent the builder deposit they were very pushy about me sending the 5k builders deposit that was overlooked immediately. I am concerned that this 5k is the only piece of leverage that I have to prevent the per diem fee. 

Should I threaten to cancel the contract and put a stop cancel on my check that’s in the mail if they don’t remove the threat of per diem fees? Do they have any legal action they can take against me for cancelling the contract?

I have already wired 115k to the escrow attorney but as I understand that can be wired back to me whenever. 

I really like this house and don’t want to have to cancel the contract but I feel backed into a corner here. If we have to end up waiting until Oct 7th to close it will cost us over 2,500 in per diem fees and U-Haul extensions. 

If we have to end up cancelling we will find another quick move in new build and hopefully be able to close by the 7th still since we have a cash offer. 

Thank you in advance for any advice!"

t3_1fpa26h,Cash vs Mortgage: New Primary Residence,"Hi! I’m evaluating a potential purchase and would appreciate insights from those experienced in this area.

Current situation:
I own a property and am considering buying a new primary residence (over $2M) with cash from a family inheritance. I’ll sell my current home in 3-6 months and intend to stay in the new home for about 15 years. The home has been on the market for 2 weeks with no offers that I am aware of. In my area, houses are usually on the market for 3-4 weeks and trends are that 80% sold over asking last month.

I’m deciding between buying outright in cash or getting a mortgage. I’d like to understand the economic implications of each option. 

1. Leverage in a sellers market: Do you believe there’s room for negotiation on the asking price given the competitive market and if so, what percentage below asking should I consider? 

2. Mortgage considerations: Would it be wiser to get a mortgage with a larger down payment instead? What factor should influence the decision given my adequate cash flow and financial stability?

3. Tax implications: As someone in the highest tax bracket, what are the tax implications of buying in cash versus using a mortgage? 

Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!"

t3_1foqi65,Need help explaining how bad of a deal this is to a family member.,"Ive got a family member that currently rents out a house on a farm thats worth 250k at about $800. The tenant wants to buy the house, but doesnt have enough for a down payment and says they cant secure a loan at a decent rate. The tenant is asking my family member to seller finance the house over 30 years at 3% with a 7k down payment , resulting in a monthly payment of ~$1024. The request would also allow for my family member to take the house into foreclosure if the tenant misses a monthly payment. While the family member sees this deal as a way to generously help out someone(the tenant) that is getting their life started, this deal also seems like a very bad deal financially. 

The family member understands that they will have to keep track of payments and that there would be work to do if the buyer defaults and the home goes into foreclosure, but im otherwise having a difficult time explaining how bad the deal seems to be financially and the other things(even good altruistic things) that could be done with the time and money if a different deal was made. Any help? Also would love to known if this is actually not a bad deal.

He kept pushing us towards homes that were way over our budget and never had time for homes we liked that were in our budget. We lost out on 2 homes that dropped in price because he didn't watch the prices on them and they were under contract by the time we knew that they were in our budget. He did help with 2 contracts for other homes where the deals ended up falling through, including one where he tried to get us to file illegal paperwork to help the deal go through and we didn't feel comfortable. We ended up buying a house that he never showed us and he was never involved with the process at all. Now he is suing us for the commission on the home we bought. He's also asking for more than double the actual commission. Can he do this to us? I know he did work for us, but he was always lazy and we ended up having to find all the homes we liked ourselves. He was also clearly greedy by only doing work for the homes that were outside our price range. We never complained because he was a friend, but now that he's suing us I'm beyond pissed.

We are back on our feet and looking to move out on our own, again, and we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Housing costs in my area are sitting at around $400k for 1500sqrft. On a mortgage with the rates these days. We are looking at $3000 a month not including utilities and HOA fees. That is almost 65% of our income. That would leave us with around 900 bucks for utilities, food, gas.

However, renting the same house in the same neighborhood, is $1900 a month. That is more affordable for us but we would be renting. Not putting money into an investment. We want to go somewhere long term but my wife only works a few days a week because she stays at home with our 2 year old the other days so making more money, isn’t in the cards right now.

We have a couple of hundred of thousand dollars to spare.

Just wonder if we should pay down the principle to reduce the monthly payment to less than $5000.

Or we should keep the cash in case of a house market crash like 2008.

t3_1fp2lm6,Mortgage Process - New Business Owner,"Hello, my wife and I are looking to buy our first house. We both have exceptional credit (800+) and have done well financially ($100k+ salaries each) but our circumstances are about to change. My wife is buying 50% of a private medical practice. Her income will go from w2 / employee to small business owner. The business itself is well established with \~30years of operation in the same spot. 

  
My question - will the bank now set her income as $0 for the next two years as with a situation like commissioned income, or are we able to use the business's past income returns to prove/justify her income (even though it's not income I guess if she hasn't owned it during that time)? I'm trying to discern if our home buying potential just nose-dived for two years. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but it would be a sucker punch in the gut to have to wait another two years when we're ready now. "
t3_1fp24jx,Sell or rent? ,"We listed our home for sale but got disappointing offers--way below comps. Super stressed about it.

We are considering renting it out instead, but we'd have to pay \~$2k/mo to cover PITI (VHCOL area). That payment goes right into equity, so its sort of like forced savings.

Should I just sell it now below comps and move on?  
Should I consider short term rental, then list in Spring?  
How about keeping it as a rental indefinitely? If my math is right, it should cash flow in year 13. I expect it to appreciate fairly well since the area is in high demand.

I am looking at netting +/- $100k. From asking around and reading online, I've gathered information but wanted to open the floor to any and all suggestions or ideas.

Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:

* 1031 Exchange: From my understanding, can not be used for a flip.
* Capital Gains or Earned Income?: Would this income be considered earned income subject to SE taxes or would this income be subject to capital gains tax?
* Buying Assets (e.g., a truck): Some people suggest buying something like a $50k truck to reduce my tax liability. But it feels strange to spend $50k to avoid $30k in taxes... or maybe that’s the right move? Lol.

I'm open to any suggestions or advice! Whether it’s creative tax strategies, investment opportunities, or anything else I should be considering, I’d appreciate your insights. Thanks in advance!"

t3_1foxqu6,How to buy city owned land?,"I realize the rules/laws/process for something like this vary by Municipality, but hoping some of you might have helpful insight or experience. Here’s the situation:

We live in an urban area in a very old home. There’s a narrow strip of land between our house and the next door neighbor (about 30 feet wide). The two homes and the land between slope down one side of a very small canyon. When the homes were built over 100 years ago, the city planned to use the land to build a foot bridge crossing the canyon. That plan was abandoned when cars became popular.  Around the same time, a garage was built behind our house and the city granted an easement to use the land for a driveway that goes along the side of the house and curves behind to enter the garage.  We would like to buy the land, straighten the driveway and move the garage out from behind our house so that we can enlarge the back yard. 

How would we even get started with this? Who would we hire to help? Any tips, or things to be mindful of? "

t3_1foxcv9,Question About Getting Involved as an Agent in a DR Horton New Build Deal,"I’m currently in the process of renewing my real estate license after it expired 7 months ago, and I’m completing the 98 hours of SAE required to get it active again. I’ve been helping someone close to me, who’s a foreigner, navigate a DR Horton new build purchase by translating and breaking down the contract since they’re not familiar with the process.

Initially, I didn’t think about trying to get involved as the buyer’s agent because I wasn’t sure how long the renewal process would take. But after doing some research, I realized it’s only 98 hours of SAE, which seems pretty doable.

Here’s the situation: the buyer was originally registered by an agent who showed them one house. Later, I came back on my own to video another house, which is the one we’ve ended up submitting an offer on. Earnest money has been deposited (it’s only been 3 days), and we’re waiting on financing approval. However, the buyer’s rep agreement hasn’t been signed yet.

The builder’s sales agent says it’s not possible to get involved as the buyer’s agent because the original agent’s name is down as the one who introduced them to the property, even though they were only there for the first house. The house we’re offering on was essentially found by us separately.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or know if there’s any way to step in as the buyer’s agent once my license is renewed, especially since the buyer’s rep agreement hasn’t been signed? I’ve basically done all the work—finding the house, breaking down the contract, and handling communication. The current agent is just collecting an easy commission. Any advice or insights would be really appreciated!

t3_1fot2sz,Thoughts on Rental Purchase And Way To Pay It Off,"I have to travel weekly for work. I travel around my state for from the big cities. The houses I am looking at are typically a nice 3 bedroom 2 bath house ranging anywhere from $180,000 - $230,000.

t3_1fox0ah,Are my parents out of touch about giving out their information to lenders/brokers or is this the norm?,"Basically my parents haven’t been in the house market for over 20 years…. They’re trying to move in the next 6months, but they refuse to give out their information to any lenders/ brokers beyond like a gross yearly income and a screen shot of their current credit rating….. They have “exceptional” credit (highest scores you can have I guess) but any ways. 

they don’t trust any one with their personal information and don’t understand why they need to give out all their information to get a quote on how much of a loan they qualify for or what interest rate they will be quoted.  We spoke with one lender today and she wanted their W2s for the last year, pay stubs for the last two months, pictures of their drivers licenses and their credit info, documentation of their current bank account balances and a bunch of other information before she could give them an idea of what they qualify for or an interest rate. It’s safe to say, they are super freaked out now because they are really protective of their private information and don’t understand why they need to share this much information just to get a basic quote when they don’t even know if they went to commit to doing business with that lender or not. Ideally they would like to shop around and get several quotes so they can get the best interest rate. 
In their case they would be looking for a conventional loan. 

I guess my question is, is this the norm? Are they going to be expected to give up all of this sensitive information to every single broker/ lender they reach out to just to get a quote? Idk enough about this to be a voice of assurance or not so I would really appreciate if others could weigh in here. 
I can’t tell if they are right to be skeptical or if this is just how things are now and they are just out of touch

Thank you!

t3_1fowo4b,Did my real estate tell me the wrong information?,"Hello,

I'm a first time home buyer and my real estate agent for the most part has been great to work with. However, after purchasing the house a couple of weeks ago it looks like there might have been a couple of things she told us incorrectly.

For instance, I asked if the garage storage which is bolted on top of the garage would be staying as well as the tv mount. Instead of telling us since they're nailed to the house they would be staying (contract only stated Tesla charger and personal belongings would be removed) she asked the sellers agent and then told us they would be removed. 

It looks like there's also other things they removed from the house leaving a lot of places to patch up. Is this something I should bring up to my agent, especially since it's been a couple of weeks since closing? Or should I just move on. 

Thank you and any advice is appreciated!"

t3_1fos6jw,Estimation of if this is worth doing,"Hi everyone! So we just bought a Quad Level home (a little over 2100 sqft not including basement) for $400K and we are both in our mid 20s so planning for the future. Right now it’s a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom. Main level where front door opens is the parlor room, dining room, kitchen, and then Upstairs 3 bedrooms and 1 dual vanity full bathroom (shower and bath). One bedroom is slightly bigger which is the only thing that makes it a master, and the bathroom is for all. Below the main level is ground level, and the bedroom down there is connected to the garage and has a door to go to the backyard so it’s better suited to an office and then the informal living room/movie room is the living space of that floor. There is also a full bathroom with just a shower. I will say the entire home has been recently updated so we have no projects we need to do. Bathrooms and kitchen are all quartzite that look like Marble and regrettably everything is white and black. I plan to paint and wall paper to add color but the only stuff easy to change I know that’s all what sells. 

My question:

The fourth level under ground is an actual basement and is also where the laundry room is. There is the perfect amount of space to finish it and make an actual nice laundry room, a larger bedroom with onsuite full bathroom and walk in closet and then a very large storage room with the space left over. Piping is already in place for all of this but not sure what it would cost to finish it. While we’re living here the idea is that each future kid would have a room plus a guest room, and we would make our master in the basement. I know a lot of people would not prefer that, but I think the fact that there’s not really a master bed/bath/closet it may make sense.

Would this increase the value of our home or at least break even? If we WANTED it to increase the value of the home would adding the escape ladder cut out infront of the window so it can formally be counted as a 5 Bed 3 Bath house vs 4 Bed 2 Bath house? Or  bc it’s quad level &amp; there’s only 7 steps to the main level and an outdoor exit right there would even be necessary. I know this would work best for us and allow us to stay in our starter home maybe 15 or so years. It’s also in the most desirable part of the city so it should sell fast no matter what we do to it.


Another questions is really, do people value having an actual Master Suite that much? Or would it be easier to just add a small bedroom, decent closet and a half bath, and then the actual nice laundry room and leave the rest storage. I have no problem with having the master in the basement as long as there IS one but idk you guys would know better than me what actually sells.

I know that’s a lot, happy to make a separate post follow up with photos of how it is now. This is not our forever home so we will be looking at this like sellers. I do think I should point out that most of the homes in the area are 3/4 bed 2bath houses selling for $350k-$500 k. And then the larger homes tend to go for $600k-1.2MM"
t3_1fowbc7,Mortgage Reinstated - New Close Out Letter?,"I fell on hard times and missed several mortgage payments. I received a reinstatement letter from my mortgage company and paid in full before the deadline. I have confirmed with my mortgage company that my account is in good standing &amp; have a current statement showing one month's payment is due on 10/1/24. 

The reinstatement was paid on 9/9/24 and I most recently spoke to my lender on 9/19/24. I just logged into my mortgage online account and see a new document posted to my account on 9/20/24 (nothing has come in the mail yet). The letter is another Close Out Letter from the lender. It says something about my account being behind, but doesn't list an amount. (It's identical to the original close out letter I received, which I then called to reinstate.)

I'm so confused and in a panic. I quadruple checked &amp; I paid the full amount listed on the reinstatement letter. My account is not behind. I'm going to call the lender in morning, but would love to hear opinions on why this may have happened. 

After confirming several times with my lender that my account is in good standing, I told the rep we can close out the application that I had previously started for assistance. I was told my account is up-to-date and will remain in good standing as long as I make my monthly payments each month moving forward. I won't have an issue making monthly payments moving forward.

I don't have the means to replace the roof unless I finance it through a high-interest credit card. I live in the Washington DC metro area where demand for housing is pretty high.

t3_1fov1h0,My realtor can’t remember my (common) name or spell it right ,"My first name is common, and my last name is common enough. Both names are fairly short (7 letter first name, 6 letter last name) and spelled the usual way. Neither name is from a different region or country or would somehow be unfamiliar to my realtors, who are also raised in the same city and background as I am and speak the same native language as I do. Like, no f*cking excuse here. 

Realtors are a husband/wife duo. 

I’m pretty sure one realtor showed up drunk to a July showing but I couldn’t prove it. Given that I’m a recovering alcoholic, I have a little credibility in knowing if someone is toasted and reeks of booze though. Couldn’t prove it so I didn’t feel like I could get out of my contract. I moved past this red flag, regrettably. 

I finally got an offer after 4 months on the market. The counter they drew up was FULL of spelling errors, my name was misspelled repeatedly, and only a quarter of the things we talked about were in it. I literally just sent them a text telling them to try again, and that I expected a higher standard of work. Frankly, I was not nice about it. 

Again, while this is unprofessional af, I don’t think I can break my contract over it and we’re literally at the counteroffer stage. 

But I’m paying them 3% of $1.1m, and…yeah, I’m hurt they can’t even spell my name after months. 

I’ve never bugged them after hours, always respected their expertise, never contacted them while they were on vacation, and encouraged work life balance. I tend to generally strike people as quiet and polite, so this is really out of character for me and I know I’m feeling the heightened emotions of selling my farm. I’m devastated to sell, but their unprofessional approach is making everything SO much worse. 

They’re also putting a ton of pressure on me to make decisions quickly. They still excluded something minor because they thought it was petty that I’d ask for curtains. They complained about adding a page to the addendum. I’m paying them $33k. I feel like for $33k they can write a few extra sentences and get it right? 

When the realtor called tonight to say she was sending over the counter, she called me by the entirely wrong name and laughed about it. There’s still one instance in the contract where my name is misspelled because I was too sad and burnt out to even bother asking for a correction. 

I don’t even want to pay them and I’m 10 seconds from backing out of a full-price cash offer or sabotaging the whole thing. I won’t, because I’m an adult, but damn I want to.

I have $112000 left on the mortgage which I pay additional to principal every month.  The idea for the longest time was to continue to pay off my mortgage, eventually rent it, and purchase a secondary home to then live in. 

However, I’m considering selling my house to then purchase something which aligns with what I want some more space, bigger property etc.

If I were to sell, after closing costs etc. I would probably walk away with $100000 estimated just based off the area. 

Financially, sticking with plan A sounds like the best financially (money coming in long term, versus a lump sum out right to then invest into a new house).  There is not an option right now to immediately rent my house and purchase another one because I do not want to dip into my savings like that for a large down payment, and with it being a second property (I believe) specific lower down payment loans are not available.

I am looking at a condo where I just got access to the property disclosures which revealed damage and repair from a leak from an upstairs unit into the kitchen about a year ago.  The cabinets were replaced and it looks like they hired large scale drying equipment, and I'm trying to confirm if they replaced any drywall or not.  But what would folks here want to see to be comfortable with the repairs to this? What signs should I or the inspector look for to determine if it was not adequate, and what are the mold risks going forward assuming that the leak has been adequately repaired?

Thank you!"
t3_1foxcnx,Talk me out of buying a house on a hill,"So, wife wants a bigger home. We start browsing Redfin, and one thing leads to another. We find this absolutely amazing 40+ year old property on a hill. 180 degree views.  Nautral light everywhere. Decks galore. Entertainers paradise. It has been completely redone, so nothing more to do. Perhaps add a pool somewhere.

  
The drive up on a single lane road doesn't worry me, and neither do the stairs. The horror stories of houses on hills do. This is in California, so wildfires and risks of earthquake are real; high rains the past few years mean that we don't know how the soil is. Given that the house has been completely remodeled, do not know if issues have been masked. Online reports scare me that soil reports, structural engineer reports don't mean much and that one should see the house at least past one wet season before knowing of any drainage issues...and I frankly know little about construction. Estimating insurance is a challenge...  


We love the views and the house though and can imagine living here for a long time. Is the only rational decision to step away? Or is there a legitimate way to assess the risk and factor that into the purchasing process?"
t3_1folkrx,ROFR Questions for Land,"My wife and I have been in the process of buying a parcel of land to build a new home. 
We submitted an offer in May and it was accepted after some negotiation. 
We started the inspection process getting soil samples, test holes for buildability, starting the septic permit process etc. 
Then in mid July ( about 3 weeks to close) we were notified that the land had a right of first refusal on the deed for some family members and the last remaining relative was still alive and interested. He was notified at that time by the selling agent and stated he was interested in the property. 
It has been 60 days now and he just last week submitted a formal offer.

We don’t want to lose this land, but we have also paid roughly $4k on the process for building on this lot and don’t want to lose that money.  We would not have spent that money if we had known up front about this issue and moved on to looking for other land. 

A few questions that hopefully someone can answer: 
1. Are the sellers forced to sell to this ROFR holder no matter the conditions?
2. Are we basically out of this money? What options could we have?
3. Who would ultimately have been responsible for notifying everyone of this deed defect?"

t3_1foq2y9,Just bought an apartment - what should I inspect first before starting renovation?,"I recently bought my first apartment, which I managed to snag at a pretty great deal, partly due to some savings and a bit of luck on a sports bet of $1200 on Stake that helped push me over the finish line. Now that the excitement of buying has worn off and I’m starting to settle in, I’m realizing that there might be some hidden issues that didn’t come up during the initial walkthrough. I’m wondering if I should do a more thorough inspection before I get too comfortable.

I’ve watched a lot of videos where people talk about issues that didn’t show up in the basic inspection reports, and I want to make sure I cover all my bases. Things like plumbing, electrical systems, and even foundation problems can turn into huge financial burdens if they aren’t caught early. I’ve been trying to educate myself on what to look for, but it feels a little overwhelming knowing where to start. I also want to make sure the apartment's in solid shape before I invest in any renovations or upgrades.

For those of you who’ve gone through this process before, what should I be focusing on first? Are there any specific areas that tend to get overlooked in typical inspections that I should check? Any advice on how to avoid potential costly repairs down the road would be much appreciated. I want to make sure my new place stays a great investment without unexpected headaches."

t3_1foh3wv,Bat infestation ,"Under contract with a home and during the home inspection we discovered that there are at least 12-15 bats, possibly more, in the attic. The inspector used the word “infestation”. However, he didn’t really assess any damage done to the attic. I believe he was afraid. Anywho, the seller will be responsible for paying for treatment. But are they terribly difficult to get rid of? Are they likely to come back? Is this a reason to back out? 

Edited to add that the homeowner knew about the bats but didn’t disclose until after it was brought up during inspection. "
t3_1fojqo5,Selling my house: Commission vs flat fee agent,"Here is the situation. I’m getting ready to sell my house in Salt Lake City and trying to decide between two agents. 

One is a traditional agent and would charge 2.25% (perhaps would even negotiate down to 2%). This includes pictures + staging + open house. We’ve met a few times and I really like him. He has a vision for how to prep the house, what things to fix, etc etc. 

The other is a flat fee agent. Cost is $3200 - $200 to list and then $3000 upon closing. That includes pictures, no staging, open house if I want one (he says open houses are mostly for curious neighbors and people trying to steal stuff). Also a nice guy and has a little less of a salesman vibe. 

I bought the house two years ago and am moving sooner than I expected. I would love to make a profit but more realistically I just want to break even. I paid $570k for it. Both agents suggest we list around ~$610k. I think that’s a little lofty and expect to get around 590-600k. 

With the commission agent I think once you add in buyers agent, closing costs and concessions, i think I’ll be taking a loss at anything under $600k. The flat fee agent gives me a bit more wiggle room. I think around $590k is my break even. 

I want to sell quickly - we are moving and signed a lease that starts October 1 so I want to minimize paying mortgage and rent. 

My heart says to go with the commission agent - he is super experienced and caring and I think will help get the house looking its best for the listing. My brain says to go with the flat fee agent - seems way more financially prudent. Both agents have good reviews. 

 Any advice on how to decide? The flat fee seems like too good of a deal to be true… what sort of risks am I not seeing?"

t3_1focs9h,Some hesitation to put an offer on a SFH that's been on the market for 2 months,"I'm considering making an offer for a listing that's been in the market for almost 2 months -- quite rare in this neighborhood, and in this city (Ann Arbor), which is still a seller's market even in the past 1-2 years when rates went up. For full transparency, here's a screenshot of the listing (don't want to type the address otherwise it'll show up in search engines) if you want to look at pics on zillow:  [https://imgur.com/g4ipCdh](https://imgur.com/g4ipCdh)

My realtor said this was way overpriced to begin with. Was initially priced at 1.4m, and they recently adjusted it to 1.3m, but it's still way too high. My realtor's CMA (which I understand is based on very limited data points) suggests $950k -- for reference, the vast majority of SFHs in that neighborhood of Ann Arbor is over $1m and quite old (built before 1950s).

The seller's agent has received no offers, and said the main complaints from other buyers were that they didn't like the layout, which my realtor and I surmised is because:

1. Many stairs. Most potential buyers are in their 40s &amp; 50s. I don't mind at all because I'm 32 and the oldest in my family, and we will likely leave Ann Arbor when our little one goes to college (in \~ 10 years).
2. The primary bedroom bathroom has a strange arrangement (you can see part of it from the pictures), but it's not a dealbreaker to me. It's just an oddly shaped bathroom. I might want to redesign part of it.
3. The basement bathroom has a very tiny shower. Quite frankly, I don't know what in the world they were thinking with that design.
4. There are 2 sets of stairs to the second floor. One of the bedrooms is unreachable from the primary bedroom unless you go through another bedroom. That's not a big deal to me.

These are the main complaints with the layout, I think. I would be happy living here, but I can't help but feel that from an investment perspective, it'll be hard to resell down the line for the same reasons as now, but who knows what's going to happen in 10 years...

Any words of wisdom for a first time homebuyer?

Also, note that I have a lease through the end of May, so I'm not in a rush. So I still have a little over 8 months, but also note that there are very few listings in that neighborhood historically, and even less that are suitable for my family -- I do anticipate a few interesting listings will show up in the next 8 months, but no guarantees on that front. Also my realtor said spring time is when there's far more competition, and ""deals"" for the buyer usually happens late in the calendar year (around November &amp; December), so I don't have a lot of competition currently."

t3_1fohg9a,Thoughts on how to upgrade from condo to single family home?,"Howdy! Really hoping that I may be able to tap into the wisdom and expertise of more seasoned homeowners on this forum :) 

A bit of background. I am a 40-year-old single man. Back in May 2021, I went under contract to purchase my first home (a new build 2 bed/2bath condo in a suburb of Denver). I closed in the Fall of 2021. I locked in at an interest rate of just over 3% and paid about $325K for the property.  

My lifelong dream has been to own a single-family home. I don't necessarily want a large home as it's just me, but I'd love to buy a smaller home with a yard where I can have a garden. I'd even be open to a townhouse with a small fenced in yard. Townhomes with yards and starter single family homes in my area start at about $450 to $500K and go up from there. 

When I purchased my condo, I had a salary of just over $60K, but I've worked hard over the past few years and recently secured a promotion. I am now making $108K ($123K with bonus potential). Looking at online mortgage calculators, it looks like this salary puts me in the range to possibly upgrade to a townhome or single-family home. 

I've only been in my condo for 3 years, and my understanding is that ideally it's best to stay in your home for at least 5 years. I'm not sure how accurate they are, but some of the mortgage rate forecasts that I've been reading are forecasting that mortgage rates may drop below 5% and could even get closer to 4% in 2027/2028 (I take those forecasts with a grain of salt as there are so many variables, and no one has a crystal ball). Regardless, I likely wouldn't plan to buy another place for at least a couple more years. 

I'm looking for advice as to how I can prepare myself to be in a position to upgrade in 2 to 3 years. I've worked very hard to improve my financial situation over the past couple years. Last month, I achieved a financial goal of having a six-month emergency fund in place, which I feel really good about. Now, I'd like to open a second high yield savings account to start pumping money into so that I can come to my next home purchase with as high of a down payment as possible. I'm thinking it would be wiser to save my down payment as opposed to investing? Also, thinking long term, I wonder if it would make sense to eventually rent out my condo since I have such a low interest rate on it, and take out a second mortgage for my next home purchase, or would it be better to sell the condo and roll the equity into my next down payment? 

Lastly, I feel like I'm getting a late start in life on all of this. I feel behind for my age, and I'm desperately trying to catch up. By the time I purchase my next home, I will be nearing my mid-40s. I'm new to all of this, and I worry that I've missed the boat in a lot of ways as I didn't buy real estate when I was younger, and before home prices exploded. I think I'm just needing some encouragement and some good advice as to where I should go from here. Any tips from anyone else who has been in a similar situation? Should I just keep saving as much as I can, then be ready when the right opportunity comes along? Anything else I should be doing to get myself in the best situation possible? Thank you for any input you are willing to share! "

I have even moved the due diligence date for the benefit of the buyer. Today is the last walk through and this buyer is driving me nuts! Either that or my realtor is. I have completely moved out and, as such, taken my router because I need to return it. Today, at this moment, this buyer is going through the home. She is nitpicking the hell out of the home.

t3_1folkru,Rental Agency,"I’m a relatively new realtor, and so far, my main success has come from handling rentals. In my area, commissions are equivalent to one month’s rent, and with rent prices being quite high, the payouts have been pretty solid. Surprisingly, many agents tend to shy away from rentals, viewing them as less profitable or “less prestigious,” but in my experience, there’s a lot of untapped potential.

Given how well rentals have been working for me, I’m thinking of taking it further by launching a dedicated rental ""agency."" My plan is to build a website and position myself as a go-to resource for rental services, focusing on delivering a smooth, seamless experience for both property owners and renters. I’d handle everything from professional photography and managing listings to guiding renters through a streamlined application and viewing process. As the business grows, I envision bringing on a showing agent through a profit-share model.

I really enjoy the rental side of real estate—helping people find homes—and I feel this path differentiates me from being just another real estate agent in a market with very limited homes for sale.

How did you get started with finding properties to rent? Do you have any advice for breaking into this niche and expanding further?"

t3_1fojwwf,Help Me Choose Between Two Homes – Need Opinions!,"Hey Reddit, I’m torn between two homes and could really use some advice from those who have been through similar decisions! Both homes are in the same general area (North Texas) and are relatively close to the same highway for commuting. Here are the main details:

**Option 1:**

* Priced at $608k
* 4 bed, 3.5 bath, with a study and media room
* 9 ft ceilings throughout, but a 2-story high ceiling in the living room
* Large, private backyard with no rear neighbors
* Lower interest rate at 4.875%
* Feels more traditional in design

**Option 2:**

* Priced at $625k
* 4 bed, 3 bath, with a study and media room
* 10 ft ceilings throughout the main floor, and modern high-end finishes (like 8 ft doors, modern staircase, etc.) and sloped ceiling in living room.
* Slightly smaller backyard, and the lot is sloped
* Slightly bigger home by 50 sq ft
* Higher interest rate at 5.5%
* Closer to higher-end homes in the community, with a more contemporary design
* Additional bedroom downstairs

**Key Points:**

* Option 1 has a more private backyard and a lower interest rate, but ceilings are 9 ft (except the living room).
* Option 2 has higher ceilings and more modern finishes but comes with a higher price and interest rate. The lot is sloped, but it’s in a slightly more premium neighborhood.

I’m leaning one way but also feeling a bit of buyer’s remorse on the ceilings and finishes. Which option would you pick and why? How much would 10 ft ceilings and modern design matter to you compared to things like a private backyard and a better rate? Would love to hear any pros/cons I may not be thinking about!"
t3_1fojpvt,Home advice ,"Hello All, long story short, my self and 2 friends started investing in real estate and bought a home together about 4 years ago. Myself and friend 1 both have our names on the mortgage loan but all 3 of us are on the deed. We wanted to only put 1 of us on the loan but I had to hop on it because of my credit score. 

About a 3 years into the property my girlfriend and I got more serious, moved out into our own home (renting) and we want to buy our own house soon. My friends still live there and pay all the bills. However, the home still shows up on my DTI so I’m finding it near impossible to get approved for another mortgage loan. We’ve looked into the assumption process but it was pretty expensive. And we cannot refinance the loan to get me off of it due to the climb in insurance rates. 

So I guess my question is if there is any way to stop this house from negatively impacting my DTI? Is there a way to prove they have been making the payments for multiple years now? Or perhaps come up with a way to show they’re renting it from me ? Any help would be appreciated   "

t3_1fopj1o,Is it the Real Estate Agents' (buyer and/or seller) duty to investigate the status of property?,"I am in NY, i am the seller. Specifically my question is ""is it the listing Agents' responsibility to check the status of the home with the Building Department to see about open permits or more importantly the true Status  - such as how many bedrooms, bathrooms, legality of basement or apartment in basement? "" where does the responsibility of the sellers agent lie? Do we just wait til the pre-closing days and see what the Title Search says?

During the later stages of my contract, few days before the closing it came out that my home was originally permitted as a 3 bedroom house but in fact it was always a 4 bedroom; I know this because my father built it and it was passed to me. I quickly rectify the problem by visiting the BoH and finding out all that was needed was a larger septic tank, I installed it and cleared it with the BoH and Building Department. I eventually lost the buyer due to a series of unfortunate delays but the major delay was the 3/4 bedroom situation.  
I was told by 2 Real Estate agents that the agents for both are responsible to due diligence. Is this true and to what extent are they liable? 
I'm not the type to sue but I'd like the agents to take a point off the future Sale. 

Edit: To be Clear, I was not aware of the fact that it was in the Building department as a 3 bedroom.  It was always a 4 bedroom as far as I knew and the Tax Bill showed 4 bedrooms, so the only things I saw was a Tax bill for a 4 bedroom occupancy.  "

The golden rule says 28% of the gross income but it doesn't make sense when the rule doesn't apply to someone who makes 4k vs 40k every month. 


Edit: I meant our total household income is 190k"
t3_1fo513m,How can you sell a property but the buyer has to build what you say? (Apartments),"The house next to my apt. building had a small fire in the attached garage, enough to put a hole in the roof of the garage. I never saw the people who lived there again.

Fast forward a couple months, I see a for sale sign. I decide to look online and it seems that whoever is selling it is only selling it to someone who will demolish the house and build an apartment building? The listing says permits are almost ready to go e.t.c....

I don't understand how you can get permits and plans and everything, but then sell it to someone while requiring they build what you planned? What sort of deal is this?"
t3_1foe0jo,Land Locked House issue,"
Hello, I bought a house 2 years ago back in 2022. It’s a land locked house with no ingress or egress due to a section of state land at the beginning of the private rd with no easement in place. I signed stuff when I closed that said I was aware of the issue. The title company stamped it and sent it to my lender and they just saw the stamp and assumed the issue had been resolved.. I got a call a couple weeks after closing and he said Fannie Mae wasn’t going to accept it due to no ingress or egress. Now I’m trying to put my house on the market and can’t get any bank to finance it. Has anyone ever heard of something like this? Can I take legal action? I would’ve never been in this situation if the lender caught it and stopped the financing from going through.."
t3_1fodvem,Buying a house but needing to switch jobs,Good morning. I have a friend who is in the process of buying a house. She is at a job but has a different one lined up. When will she be able to switch jobs and it not effect the mortgage. 
t3_1fodh22,Interested in buying this home but I have little to no experience with this stuff,"It's a renovated 1989 trailer for 25k OBO or 10k down with owner financing. Two bedrooms one bath. It's on a lot and the lot rent is 400 a month. 

I know people frown on trailers, especially old ones but with the price of homes these days there's no way in hell I'll ever be able to afford that. It looks like a nice trailer. Better than the illegal shed that I'm living in. Just gotta make sure it's not a scam.

I make $18 an hour. I have 11k saved up, touching 12k. A little extra in a CD and I just started investing in stocks(Walmart stock program for associates). I can easily schedule more hours for myself and bring home a bigger check. And I can try to find a roommate.

Should I be interested? "
t3_1fo1w3e,House going back on the market - best to go about it?,"Buyers backed out because they decided they no longer wanted the house. I know it can be a red flag for a house to go back on the market so I wasn’t sure the best way to go about it. Like should I wait a bit before relisting it? Say something in the listing about how it’s back on the market at not fault to seller. Should I expect to get around the same price for it? 

Just kind of stressed about this whole process. "
t3_1fochf5,How to negotiate a mortgage?,"Looking to buy \[very\] shortly and trying to sort out financing. In DC area. Wondering what the best way to get a good deal is. I know the standard advice is ""shop around"" and I have been doing that, but at this point I'm trying to get a bit more operational detail on what that actually entails - not just looking at rates as advertised or even as pre-approved for, but nuts and bolts of getting the concrete terms I want.

From reading several threads on the topic, it seems like the approach should be something like:

1. Before making an offer, get pre-approved with several potential lenders
2. Make the offer using the pre-approval letter from the lender I like best (not necessarily the best rate)
3. Once I have an offer ratified, take the offer details to all the potential lenders and get a concrete loan estimate from each of them, with exact rate and closing costs
4. Take the best rate / closing cost / APR loan estimate to the lender I like best and ask them to match (or get as close as they can)
5. Ideally, they match the terms and I go with them instead

Does that sound about right? What would you do differently? Any other negotiating tips?"
