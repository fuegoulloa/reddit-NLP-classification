t3_1fy6r62,"A week's long trip to Iceland, September 2024","For a while now I wanted to go to Iceland, and finally did it last month, and I have enjoyed it so much!

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much). 

The pictures, in order, are from: Seljalandsfoss, Solheimajokull *2, Vik, Reynisfjara beach, Selvallafoss, Northern Lights in a place close to Hvammsvik, Kirkjufell, Londrangar, Budakirkja, Gulfoss, Kerid Crater, Geysir, Reykjavik and Hvammsvik. ",1728305213.0,2024-10-08 10:34:14

t3_1fyv0n8,Broken NFC tag on passport ,"Hello,

I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience. I am a Ukrainian citizen with a residence permit in the EU.

Recently, while traveling, I accidentally spilled water on my biometric passport. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be heavily affected; the appearance and 99% of the stamps look just like before.

However, I’m concerned about the biometric NFC chip embedded in the passport’s cover. I wasn’t even aware of its existence before. Now that I’ve read about it, I found an app called ReadID and tried to scan the chip — but it’s not being detected :(

For instance, my friend’s passport scans without any issues.

My question is: how critical is this problem? Could it affect border crossings, opening bank accounts, or any other procedures where the passport is required? Does this make the passport invalid? Or is there a chance that official institutions have different devices that might be able to read the chip, even if my phone can’t?

Thank you very much in advance for your reply.

(I cannot replace the passport at the moment since I would need to go to Ukraine for that, and right now that would mean being automatically drafted into the war. Although I haven’t lived there for over 10 years.)",1728376480.0,2024-10-08 10:34:14

I’ve read that if you are only transitioning through the country through a selected airport (which ours is on the list) you don’t need to apply for a visa, you only need to apply for a 24hour permit which allows you to stay only in the airport and you have to prove you have a connecting flight. Our layover will be 9 hours. 

Would I still need to pay for a visa or would I apply for one of those permits before departing the UK or prior to landing in china?

It’s October, so obviously YMMV. I’m a keen traveller, mainly in Europe and have visited over 300 small towns and cities. Taormina was right up there for me. The sweets were delicious, we chose a restaurant a bit out of the way of the beaten path, and hiked around the town a bit. We are two young women travelling, based in Catania for the week. 

Yes: Catania is grittier and more “authentic” and I would say the food scene is better. And the night time is lit up and beautiful and eclectic. It’s fun, it’s the perfect base. But Taormina has charm, gorgeous views, lovely beaches. It’s not a hellhole. If I were to compare, for example, with Oia in Santorini which truly was a whitewashed hellhole of exactly the same manufactured crap over and over, made in PRC, you’d obviously see Taormina is the better choice.

t3_1fyfmr8,Trying to round out my Taiwan itinerary,"Hi all,

I've got a trip coming up to Taiwan at the end of this month for about 8 days. We'll be starting out in Taipei and planning to do a lot of the common activities and day trips from there (Yangmingshan, Beitou, biking around the city, night markets, Elephant and/or Teapot mountain hikes). 

We want to see another part of the country as well and have landed on Tainan. Currently we're booked for 3 nights there (arrive afternoon day 1, two full days, leave early back to Taipei on day 3). 

I've read that Tainan is all about history and food, and personally I'm not too much into the history when I travel. I'm not disinterested, but I'm not the type of person to prioritize museums or temples just for the educational aspect. I'm more intersted in nature/scenery, food, walking/biking around, local culture. It's very hard to tell if two full days in Tainan is going to be overkill for this and if we should prioritize Taipei time. 

Also we were considering the east coast but spending 5 hours to and from Taitung seemed like a lot of time after the rest of our travel (we'll be in Singapore coming from US first, so a lot of time on planes and traveling). Though biking around that area seems really nice. 

Just trying to find a good way to round out our trip and a bit worried Tainan might be a miss. It seems very polarizing in that many people recommend but then many people say it's boring. For someone like me that wouldn't normally prioritize museums/historical education, is there still enough to fill 2 days that wouldn't be better spent elsewhere?

t3_1fy2dpd,The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

t3_1fyam9q,BOA (Boliviana de Aviación) airlines warning,"Heads-up for anyone traveling to/through Bolivia. 

BOA airlines sucks and is very corrupt (not surprising to anyone who knows Bolivia well). With Bolivia's recent currency volatility, things have gotten a lot worse. Not a lot of options around Bolivia, unfortunately. 

  
**IF FLYING BOA:** 

1. Do not let the airline put priority tags on your luggage (if you are paying for an upgraded seat). All this will do is make your bag a target to be stolen / ransacked when checked 

2. Keep everything valuable with you... Particularly cash (should be obvious but i'll state the obvious)

3. If you are checking a bag, don't lock your luggage. Airline workers will just cut the locks off and ruin your suitcase. Might as well let them search through your things without breaking your suitcase so you don't have to spend a few hundred replacing the luggage they ripped into. BOA will not take any accountability for their employees breaking into your luggage and stealing your belongings.

  
This is not to say Bolivia is not a great country worth visiting. Just note that with the recent currency volatility, things have gotten worse so be extra careful. ",1728315390.0,2024-10-08 10:34:14

The market there at the moment is currently very focused on the domestic market, which makes sense when there is such huge domestic demand and a lack of English proficiency. As population decline hits China and it becomes more willing to accept foreign tourists, I presume it could become a huge market. Sichuan, Tibet, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhangjiajie have huge draws.

This is more of a fantasy of mine, that likely won't come true as it's so far away from Europe and Asia, but Chile has incredible tourism potential. Patagonia, cruises, vineyards, and great food.",1728239828.0,2024-10-08 10:34:14

We live in Scandinavia so the days in winter are long, dark and cold, especially January. We´re both prone to winter depression, so now that we have the opportunity for a vacation in January, we´re planning on taking it. Indonesia has been an option we have been considering, and we wouldmlove to go there, but it seems as though the rain season is at it´s peak in January in parts of Indonesia. Though the rain itself doesn´t bother us that much, the high humidity does.

For context we would love to stay somewhere that´s not super mainstream or full of resorts. If we find a nice area, we´ll look into the opportunity of renting a nice little place for a couple weeks, somewhere by the coast, somewhere quiet.

We love good food but our budget doesn´t allow us fine dining, but that´s not a problem, somewhere with good local food is more than enough! We would love to stay somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture! We also love to surf and swim (we´re both beginners at surfing though) , but having that oppurtunity is also a big part of the vacation.

My first purely personal (i.e. not for business) trip internationally.
I loved every single minute of it. From the food to the people, I couldn't make a single complaint. 
There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").
I wasn't sure what to expect but I had the time of my life.",1728231197.0,2024-10-08 10:34:14
t3_1fyfn9k,South America 6 weeks travel itinerary,"Hello Reddit travelers!

We are a couple from Sweden, 30 and 27 years old, planning a 6-week trip through South America starting in January 2024. We’ve already booked our arrival and departure flights, landing in Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd of January and flying home from San José, Costa Rica, on the 18th of February. We love  to explore both cities and nature, but prefer to keep things fairly comfortable, avoiding long hikes and multi-day camping trips. We’ll mostly be flying between countries to save time and exploring various destinations without overloading our schedule. We're looking to stay in private rooms at hostels to stay on budget, but might consider hotels for a few nights in total if they're worth the extra buck. 

We have a route in mind and would love any feedback, especially tips on the must-sees, hidden gems, and general advice on logistics!
 

**--- January 3–13 (10 days) – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

We’re thinking about staying in the Ipanema area, close to Copacabana.
Planning to explore iconic spots like Sugarloaf Mountain, Selarón Steps, Parque Lage, and the beaches of course.
We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe).
Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out.
For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.   


 We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in?
We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?  


 **--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.**

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants.
Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.


**--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco)  – Fly to Cusco, Peru.**

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?  

  
**--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).**

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing?
Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.


**--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.**

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.


**--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.**

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example.
We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? 
We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?


**--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.**

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic.
Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

- 

We’re aiming for a balance between adventure and relaxation while being budget-conscious. Also, if anyone has hostel recommendations with private rooms, please let us know! Thanks in advance!",1728327753.0,2024-10-08 10:34:14

This is a story of injustice and an unacceptable customer approach.

In short - We had a flight cancellation due to a threatening attack by Iran on Israel. We had a hard time communicating with INDIE and faced some inflexible and fixed approaches to our case, although it is an extreme case that was not under our control! 

After all - I had to replan and reschedule everything from scratch.  

Unfortunately, there were 700 Euros differences in the price - I was refused to get any of it nor to get it back as a voucher! On top of that because of minor damage, they charged us 500 Euros instead of subtracting and although we had premium insurance (we tried to use all the money that was left on their side! ) 

On the last day of my trip, I found out that the amount was being documented literally as a ""refund"" on my Indie account but only visible to the customer service staff - I was shocked. They don't want to release our money!

We're looking for recommendations for an eco lodge type experience in mainland Europe for April 2024.

Current Google search is giving either Airbnb (don't want to self cater), Center Parcs type massive places (too big), or hotels. Or lovely little eco lodges that are absolutely not family friendly.

We'd love somewhere in the middle of nature... Little chalet accomodation, tents, sheds that sort of thing... Where you can walk about and be in nature... Trees, ponds, forests and the great outdoors. Small and family run is more our bag and family friendly is a must (absolutely minimum a playground or similar on site), as is a restaurant (I don't want to self cater). Would be great if there were activities on site or within an easy drive.

We're not really fussed about facilities so long as the place is clean and the food is good (previous holidays have been spent in sheds...)... Having said that, budget can go up to £4k for a week, so we can do high end if it's good enough.  ",1728316618.0,2024-10-08 10:34:14
t3_1fy9zwm,"Connecting through Miami International on Friday, should I change it?","I'm flying from South America to Chicago via Miami on Friday the 11th, and this hurricane that's brewing has me worried. 

It's not supposed to hit Miami as of right now but that could change. Also Friday is like 2 days after the estimated landfall that's going to be on Wednesday and it should've dissipated by then but I don't know how much.

What worries me is that if the area surrounding the airport floods then they're probably going to close that airport. 

It's very important that I get to Chicago on Friday so I can't move the trip to next week. 

It's going to be me and my wife but we're in separate reservations. Hers is paid with cash and has a strict cancellation policy and mine was with miles and has a flexible cancelation policy. 

I have the option of flying through Houston instead, which will give me a little peace of mind but we would be forfeiting her ticket and losing that money. The thing is that I should make the decision today, bc the price is still kinda reasonable. 

So my options would be, waiting it out and leaving everything as is, but risk my trip getting upended by the hurricane, or losing my wife's ticket money and just changing my ticket and buying a new one for her (but risking that Miami would be unscathed and I spent all that money for nothing)

After five intense years of working Mondays to Sundays building my (successful!) business and taking 0 vacation, I’m craving some well-deserved rest on a beautiful beach, soaking in the sun and gazing at the turquoise ocean.

I’m considering a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands and looking to book either an Airbnb or, more likely, a hotel there.

It's a red eye flight that stops in HK at 4am and my connecting flight isn't until around 8am. My question is can I expect anything to be open at 4am at HK airport? Like food or shops?

I got my ESTA application denied today within an hour of applying. Probably less.
I checked my details and they are correct, apart from me putting down my Personal Identification Number as National Identification Number. That may be the reason.

Circumstances:
- I have dual nationality (Serbian by birth)
- I don't have Hungarian ID card

The latter relates to the National Identity Number issue, in case they need the ID Card Number. 

Any similar issues/cases?

t3_1fy4t60,UAE Passport Vaildity - expires 6 months and 6 days whilst on holiday in Dubai. Can I still travel from UK and apply for Emergancy passport at the British Embassy in Dubai? Urgent help needed - due to fly out tonight with BA from LHR,"According to the UAE or foreign affairs, to travel to the UAE 'Passports must be valid for at least 6 months from the 'date of entry' into the UAE, however my passport expires whilst I'm out there (a day before to be exact).

I can either cut my holiday short by a day that would mean I can travel back before the '6 month expiry period' or if the rule doesn't apply on leaving dubai then I might be okay. I won't know until I get to the airport and will have to take that chance. If I cannot travel due to this then I'm uncertain if my travel insurance would cover me for this as it would be my responsibility to know before booking.

The expedia website didn't ask for passport information assuming all was okay until I tried to checking in on BA website, although 
I was able to check on, it wouldn't allow me to print my boarding pass.  The only way it worked was by cutting it down by 1-day (which is the date of expiry (6 months before expiry - 14th April 2025)

t3_1fyj80o,Can KLM really trick me into giving them EUR 980,"
All my life I’ve been dreaming of going to Rio de Janeiro. I booked a flight to celebrate finishing my master’s degree. I had to work while studying to afford this trip. I booked a basic fare (EUR 980) by accident and asked customer service if I could upgrade to a student fare (for an extra EUR 110). They told me it was okay. The student fare brings several benefits such as checked-in luggage but most importantly, flexibility. You can reschedule for free and get a refund for EUR 250. So I upgraded. When upgrading I specifically asked if I could get all the benefits from the student ticket. Yes, they said, I specifically asked if I could reschedule for free and if I can reschedule for free and get a refund for the TOTAL price minus the EUR 250 cancellation fee. The lady said yes.

To keep a long story short, my last exam didn’t go as planned and I don’t really know when exactly I can go (this is out of my control). So instead of rebooking the flight for free I decided it’s worth losing the cancellation fee of EUR 250 from my total EUR 1090 and rebook by myself afterwards somewhere in mid-February to mid-March since I didn’t know exactly when I would be able to go.

The issue: I got back EUR 110 and nothing else. I explained to customer support that I was informed the opposite and they simply don’t care. Since I did the upgrade and asked about the cancellation through phone, I expect their guidance and given word to be correct. What can I do?

This post discusses an issue with KLM’s customer service after a flight upgrade and subsequent cancellation.",1728336597.0,2024-10-08 10:34:15
t3_1fy4rhm,Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

t3_1fyh24n,Flight Fares Driving Me Nuts – Is There Any Real Price Protection?,"Hey folks, I’ve been trying to book a flight from SFO to PVR and, man, these fares are all over the place. One day they’re sky-high, the next they’ve plummeted. United seems to be at the helm of this madness.

I’ve even seen next-day flights drop in price significantly, which is super frustrating because I’m torn—do I grab something “reasonable” now, only to watch it fall by $200 a week later? Should I wait? Am I just doomed to stress-refreshing flight deals?

I vaguely remember some airlines offering price protection, but I can’t recall which ones (or if that’s even still a thing). Maybe third-party sites like Orbitz offer this? Though, my last experience trying to make a claim with one of those price guarantees felt like battling customer service bosses in an endless loop of “please hold.”

So, what’s the best strategy for dealing with these wildly fluctuating fares? And is there any legit price protection out there? Would love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT:**  I just booked a fare and didn't realize that United now has this ""fare lock"" feature where you can lock the fare for - in this case - 3 days - and then opt to buy or not.  Wish I had known about this feature earlier as the prices have been fluctuating wildly by the day.  Well, thanks again, all.",1728331248.0,2024-10-08 10:34:15

* Is March a better choice due to lower crowds and costs, despite being colder? I’ve heard April might be crowded due to school holidays and Easter. Is the warmer weather worth the extra expense? How about May? Will things be more expensive then?

**Itinerary:** 

* We’re planning to visit:
   * **Madrid (4 days)**
   * **Granada (2 days)**
   * **Seville (3 days)**
   * **Valencia (2 days)**

  
Does this order make sense? Are the number of days in each city sufficient, or would you recommend any changes? We would like to do the trip in 10-11 days.

**Day Trips:**

* How about day trips to Toledo and Córdoba? Are they worth the time?
* Should we include Malaga too?

**Other Tips:**

* Is there anything else we should keep in mind while planning? For now we plan to cover just the southern part of Spain.

A few days later, the problem is fixed. With a few tweaks, it’s still possible to go on the second half of the vacation. But booking new outbound flights at such notice is very expensive. The cost can be afforded, but not comfortably. 

What would you do?

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip.

Also, I must clarify that I was referring to a time that is WELL before landing, that is before the pilot announces “cabin crew prepare for landing”. I’m aware that they can’t help you after. 

Also, we don’t pay for water here :)

For the last 4 days... December 26-29.. I am contemplating flying to Salta to explore. This would give me  2-1/2 to 3 days there.. leaving out flying time.

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool. In the later option I would probably lose a day due to flying.. (the flight is only 2 hours, but to get to airport and out of airport twice etc.. will shoot most of a day.

* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

t3_1fy6p82,Krakow Travel Report,"**Arrival:**

My visit to Kraków took place on an overcast few days in early October 2024. I'd set aside three days for the city and a day trip to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. The appeal was the affordability of the trip and a curiosity to visit a Polish city and learn more about Polish culture, the WW2 history at Auschwitz-Birkenau (the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers) was also a factor in the decision to go. Many Poles choose to come to work and live in my country of residence; and I reciprocally desired to gain an understanding of their cultural background.

Alighting at the train station and walking past Barbakan (est. 1498) and through St. Florian's Gate (c. 1307) was an impressive entrance to the city. It was about 10pm at this point and as we walked down Floriańska (St. Florian's Street), I quickly noticed a number of dolled up young women standing in the middle of the street holding black umbrellas in the light rainy drizzle, looking around at bypassers. Was this prostitution or something else? Not the best first impression, but I am aware that soliciting for prostitution is legal in Poland and their laws on the matter are more lax. Sadly, in my opinion this does colour public spaces with a sleazy vibe, I think such activities should be kept out of sight especially in such a thoroughfare not far from the main square. Even at night. I did not notice any police presence monitoring these apparent activities.

**Day 1:**

Fast forward to the next day and we started by walking through part of the charming ‘Planty park’ (a circular park which encompasses the entire Old Town district), noticing an amusing overabundance of park benches. Unfortunately there were no big central parks or highly curated green areas besides this. We then hauled ourselves up a gradual slope to ascend Wawel Hill to the castle and cathedral. This is considered the most culturally important site in Poland. After having a quick stroll around the imposing Italian-style castle courtyard, we chose to enter the (nearly 1,000 year-old) cathedral via the audio-guided tour, which was not too costly. Sadly the cathedral tower was heavily scaffolded which tarnished the view. The audioguide headsets conveniently triggered different audio clips as you walk around the site, which meant you didn't have to key in numbers. Wawel Cathedral is where Polish monarchs were formerly crowned and buried. The monarchy was abolished on 25th November 1795. It's a shame that the Polish monarchy has ended as I find national interest in its own intelligentsia and ruling class to be a showcase of heroism, statecraft, and political leadership through the centuries. Although I acknowledge the valid criticism of the notion of monarchy.

From the outside, the cluster of different architectural additions over the centuries is intriguing to see, particularly the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel (1533) which was beautiful and is considered the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps, dedicated to the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty. It's worth noting that the site was getting quite busy and numerous tour groups were congregating and piling through the cathedral. Because it was a relatively small cathedral, this crowding did feel slightly uncomfortable (but still manageable) at times. There were no photos permitted inside the cathedral. 

We ascended the steep steps of the Royal Sigismund Bell tower which led to the bell at the top and a slightly restricted view over the city through a wire barrier. There was a photo op to touch the bell's clapper, which is considered good luck. Once again it was quite busy in this space owing to the crowds, luckily there was a separate descent staircase available.

We then walked down Wawel Hill into the expansive 13th century town square (Rynek Główny), the so-called ‘biggest medieval square in Europe’ according to some sources, but Charles Square in Prague is actually two times larger FYI. Our first port of call was the free to enter Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) shopping arcade in the middle of the town square, many vendor outlets sold what looked like traditional Polish goods, in particular the amber goods typical of the region and many other figurines, souvenirs, and models. 

After this we entered the grand Brick Gothic St. Mary's Basilica which sadly had a cladding of scaffolding on the main tower due to longterm repairs, meaning ascending the tower was not possible. The interior was beautiful but it was a fairly brief experience after sitting down to soak up all the churchiness. Every hour a bugle player plays a traditional five-note bugle call (hejnał) from the basilica's tallest tower. They often wave down at the crowds below. We popped into the Muzeum Farmacji (Pharmacy Museum), it is a small museum which features a good collection of pharmacy paraphernalia, but I wasn't raving about it after a few rooms full of similar jars and pots. The information and presentation of the museum appeared to have been unchanged for many years.

Walking around Wawel Hill and the town itself, images of the Polish Pope, John Paul II (1920-2005) - born Karol Józef Wojtyła - can be seen in many places, some may even say excessively! I found it quite whimsical seeing so many portraits of JP2, even despite my reservations about the Catholic Church as an institution. You can sometimes see monks walking around the town on their daily commutes.

**Day 2:**

On our second day we hopped on a guided tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. The tour was well organised although the bus itself was fairly cramped. First we stopped at Auschwitz I (Stammlager), known as former administrative and operational centre of the death-camp, and we're given headsets to hear a crystal clear transmission of the guide's voice as we were taken around the site as part of the group tour. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was the more visually striking of the two sites, with the instantly recognisable gatehouse and train tracks. The Birkenau site was even bigger than I'd imagined. The barbed wire fences and guard towers tapered off into the distance, with the site covering 6,000 football pitches of space. Both sites put together were a moving warning about humanity's darkest capabilities, with well-selected and impactful exhibits. Although I could see no central dedicated museum building. We returned to Kraków, getting back at around 7pm before then going to ‘The Black Duck’ restaurant which was very good value and enjoyable (plus points for duck theming), it was hands down the culinary highlight of the trip. Walking back to our accommodation we were solicited by a prostitute, but politely turned down the offer.

**Summary:**

I found Poland quite dour. A number of the eateries we went to nearly all played melancholic music, many of the souvenir shops stock items with an intriguing tearful girl theme, combining this melancholia with a sudden rundown post-communist greyness (and countless graffitied walls) almost immediately outside of Kraków's Old Town district, the hyped up Kazimierz area is no exception to this. Alongside the city's proximity to a major former Nazi death-camp, the experience was somewhat overshadowed by these things. Of course, Poland cannot easily separate itself from this history under Soviet &amp; Nazi occupation and before that being partitioned three times (the Austrian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition) in the late 18th century leading to 123 years of no Polish sovereignty. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed. The identity and nation of the Poles has been under threat for centuries and I think this reflects in the locals' outlook and culture, they are a guarded people fiercely interested in their national identity and faith. This is a nation in the process of regaining its pride and sense of self. The creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, was only founded in 1989, making modern Poland only 35 years old. In 2022, Poland, Greece, and Cyprus had the highest percentage of adults in the EU at risk of depression, with a share of 65 percent. This is a country with many depressed and downhearted people, but Poland is certainly moving through a period of new beginnings.

Another thing to mention is the Cracovian road zebra crossings don't often have traffic lights. So there were a number of times I felt unsafe trusting motorists to spot me and stop to allow me to safely cross the road. With that being said there isn't a lot of traffic around Kraków and locals are encouraged to use the trams.

Tourist attractions around Kraków were okay, it's very church-heavy reflecting the Catholic way of life there. At times I felt the historical museums could have told Poland's national story more narratively and engagingly. I understand there was a golden age for Poland before the partitions and then occupations during the 20th century. This golden age roughly corresponds to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572).

However, I found the Cracovian museums to be more descriptive than narrative in tone, drily listing information rather than arranging it for a modern touristic palette. Because Poland's history is more on the niche side, I'd have hoped for a more comprehensive overview/retelling. The Rynek Underground Museum (under the town square) seemed like a tourist trap displaying a banal arrangement of rocks and pillars. I decided to avoid entry. The same can be said of the former town hall tower, the view is said to be extremely limited.

To justify a trip to Kraków I recommend spending about two days there max. You will enjoy great value for money on food and drink but the tourist sites are nothing out of this world. You should ideally combine the town with a day trip to either the salt mine or Auschwitz-Birkenau, or perhaps to the mountains nearby if you are outdoorsy (the Tatra Mountains and Zakopane, a popular resort town in the foothills of the mountains). I recommend taking in the town slowly, it shouldn't be rushed as you may quickly run out of things to do if you are not careful.

I give Kraków an overall 5.5/10.

**Souvenirs:**

I struggled to find many souvenirs/keepsakes that really caught my eye. I would recommend having a look in the Kraków Cloth Hall and the outlets on the outside of the building, although I felt much of the items for sale were almost identical between the stalls, the variety on offer was unfortunately lacking. 
I recommend checking out Niebieska Kropka Boleslawiec Pottery and the ""Kacper Ryx"" Historical Shop. I purchased a handmade fridge magnet from the latter which was fairly pricey, but had rustic appeal. I also stumbled across the Wawel Castle Souvenir shop (to the left of the courtyard entrance as you enter) and it turned out to be one of the better souvenir shops in Kraków. So do check that out.

**Food:**

None of my travel review should be considered exhaustive, but I highly recommend going to Czarna Kaczka/ Black Duck for authentic Polish cuisine. Try the Borscht (beetroot soup), it's very tasty. Also make sure you have pierogi somewhere during your visit. For breakfast I heartily recommend Milkbar Tomasza and the savoury pancake with spinach and cheese filling.",1728305046.0,2024-10-08 10:34:15
t3_1fxrmv5,sabbatical travel from Canada,"So next year I'm on sabbatical. When I say next year, I basically mean September 2025 to June 2026 (I'm a teacher...that's a year for me with summer being a bonus!lol)

I'm hoping to travel as much as my money will allow. We live in Montreal. My son is off one week in November and one week in April (Easter) so I'm looking for a destination with him. He will be 15 and obsessed with Disney. We have already been to the Florida and California ones. He wants to be an imagineer when he's older. Some ideas: Paris with Disneyland, a Disney cruise from Florida, Greece (he's also into mythology and Percy Jackson). He's not a picky eater which is good for traveling and loves museums. 

My daughter will have the first three weeks of January off. She will be 18 and is very easy going. Not really into museums. She wants to learn how to surf and is super into Asian culture (but Japan is a no no which will be explained later). I was thinking Vietnam, Costa Rica, a cruise, New Zealand, a cruise, etc. We can also do a group thing (Intrepid or G adventures). She will not travel somewhere where she needs an extra vaccine! lol!

At some point during my break I'm planning on going to Japan with my husband. Just the two of us. We aren't sure when, probably October or early March (before blossoms). I think we should add South Korea since it's close.

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I am not bound to specific vacation times like when I'm teaching. Usually I can only travel during the summer (which is too bad since we have great weather here and have a pool we like to enjoy), Christmas or March break.

t3_1fwo3rv,Croatia Road Trip 2024,"This summer I went on a trip to Croatia with my family. We rented a car and went from Zagreb all the way to Dubrovnik. Here’s a summary.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

t3_1fxk2d5,13 Day Itinerary Check - Switzerland,"Hello! I tend to be an overly type A, ambitious person when it comes to traveling because I want to see everything I possibly can. I also love planning and making itineraries.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

We're aiming for mid-late May 2025. Thank you in advance!

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast. While sometimes we decide a full packed day is worth it, we often like to go out and do something, come back to the hotel and nap/chill, and go back out for the late afternoon/evening. So we're looking for a home base with lots of options for interesting things to do where it's easy to be a bit spontaneous.

I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

t3_1fxdr8n,2+ weeks in Guatemala and Belize,"Hi,

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

What doesn't make sense to me is the trip from Atitlan to Flores as it's a 10-12 hours journey. But then it makes sense to get from Flores to Belize.

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

Would you amend the time spend in any of the placea above? I hear mixed opinions about Semuc Champey so skipped it as it's a long journey.

What would be the best way to tackle this?",1728211577.0,2024-10-08 10:34:16

t3_1fxgmu1,Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

Did a bit of research and so far see that the top 3 countries are Tanzania, Kenya, or South Africa. Was wondering if anyone had any experience with any of these and had any recommendations. Looking for my safari to be around a week give or take, in the summer months, so June or July. And really I just want to just see some nice wildlife. I’m also wondering if there’s any recommendations for certain national parks or game reserves. Or for specific tour guide companies/agencies. Additionally after the safari we want to go somewhere coastal we were thinking Zanzibar if we go to Tanzania, or Cape Town if we go to South Africa. I’ve heard the crime situation in South Africa is pretty bad, but I’m not sure how bad it really is because I know people (especially tourists) tend to exaggerate. I’ve been to a few third world countries already and am by no means one of those people who will avoid a country because of the crime factor, unless it’s truly really bad, (think like Syria, Somalia etc).

I hated having to rush to the beach/pool early in the morning in Antigua to get a chair for the day. I know not all resorts are like this. The food was also terrible in Antigua.

My family is looking at going to Peru to hike the Inca Trail this December around Christmas. I’m super pumped, I’ve always wanted to do this, so I have no objections. However, I’ve been thinking about the logistics, and am feeling a little bit hesitant now.

I am very concerned that I will lose weight during the hike. I’m vegan (I am willing to just be vegetarian during the hike for convenience), but I’m nervous that the food offerings will not be sufficient to replace all the calories lost during the days. I’ve also seen some people saying they became ill from either altitude, I’ll bring altitude pills, or the food. 

Obviously, I’m going to talk to the tour company we decide to book with just to make sure, but at the end of the day I cannot stand to lose anymore weight. If any of y’all have experience with the trail and lost/gained/maintained weight please let me know what company you went with and what the food situation looked like.

t3_1fxbat3,Cairns/Port Douglas vs. Auckland for last big trip from Australia,"My partner and I have lived in Australia a few years and are currently in Hobart. We plan to move back to North America in the next year and are deciding between two options for our final big (expensive) trip - The Great Barrier Reef or New Zealand. 

Due to timing and cost, we can only spend a week, so we’d be limited to just one of the islands in NZ. Timing is in the next two months, which I know isn’t great as we get into rainy season for QLD, but that’s what works for our schedules. I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. ",1728200554.0,2024-10-08 10:34:16

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her. We’ve both been Booking members for almost the exact same amount of time, booked about the same amount (we go back and forth each trip), and are both at the same Genius level as well as the same amount of bookings away from reaching the next level.

What is going on here? I understand d A/B testing or selectively offering different locations and devices certain rates, but we are, for the most part, going into the searches with the exact same parameters.

Both on iPhones, same IP, same Genius level, about the same past spending.

And yet, she’s getting minor to massive discounts every time and I’m stuck more or less just paying the normal rate…

So far, we're expecting a minimal itinerary: A walk in town, occasionally grab dinner, visit a beach or two. Because we're a large group, most places that can accommodate us are a drive away, or a good 30-minute walk, from the town centre or beach. So there would be some short distance travel involved with the itinerary.

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

t3_1fxblxi,How is this Switzerland itinerary for Jan?,"Me and my family will be in Lyon over January and we want to spend a week in Switzerland. It'll be me + partner and 2 kids (6 and 10).

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)",1728201948.0,2024-10-08 10:34:16

There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them.

We’re looking for a laid-back, quaint place to stay that isn’t overly touristy, but still close to activities we love. Specifically, we want to:

* **Scuba dive** and **snorkel**
* **Fish**
* Spot some local **wildlife**
* Relax on a **nice sandy beach**

We’re not into the super-commercial vibe, so if anyone has recommendations on where to stay that’s more quiet and off-the-beaten-path, we’d really appreciate it! Also, if anyone has tips on which island is better for the activities I mentioned, that would be super helpful.

t3_1fx2p7q,Looking for advice/recommendations for Europe itinerary ,"Hi all,

I'm planning a trip to Europe for May of next year, where I will be traveling with my parents and sister for about 14 days. The current very rough outline is to fly into Prague, spending several days there and possibly adding day trips to Kutna Hora or other nearby towns. We would then make our way to Munich where we would also spend several days. We would end our trip in Switzerland, spending about a week there before flying out from Zurich. My questions are:

Are 14 days a viable amount of time for this plan?

Would it make more sense to rent a car or travel exclusively by train?

Are there any places along this general route that you would recommend visiting?

Where would you advise staying overnight or spending a day in Switzerland?

Our interests include sites with historical value such as old city centers, castles, etc, as well as museums and architecture. We also look forward to trying some good local beer and experiencing nature. I am looking into all of this myself of course, but I have seen some great advice for various trips in this sub and would love to hear what you all think! Thank you in advance.

Me and my girlfriend just booked our flight to go to Vietnam in April. One of the (many) things we intend to do there is the Ha Giang Loop, a 3/4 day motor tour across the Ha Giang region. Now my girlfriend doesn’t have a lot of riding experience so the plan is to rent 1 motorcycle, but we’ll both have quite the backpacks with us since we’re traveling for 4 weeks.

In retirement planning, my wife and I want to continue to travel, but I have had recent realizations making me really think of how to do that once we're retired. We live in the USA. My worry is the realization that Medicare doesn't cover you if you're traveling to places like Europe or Asia. But at that age, it seems like a chance of an ER visit may be greater. Like if I'm 70 and had a heart attack, do you just screw yourself for the rest of your retirement? My current insurance provides health care abroad, but I'd hate to work to my death just for the health care. I'd also hate to not travel just for the chance I might have an ER visit. Do you just buy travel insurance for the trip to cover that? I've seen things like Faye but then I also read that they can be a pain to deal with and not pay out. thanks for any insight you all can provide. I've got a long time (25+ years) until I retire so this could be a completely different thing by then, but trying to be ahead of the game.",1728151212.0,2024-10-08 10:34:16

t3_1fwza4i,Hawaii Flights Question - DEN vs. SFO Transfer,"Hi everyone,

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport? Also does anyone know Denver airport well? Would we have to switch terminals in order to get to the domestic departures gate from the international arrivals gate? I know they have 6 terminals, but please also let us know the fastest method to get there and how long it would take. Thanks!",1728159321.0,2024-10-08 10:34:16

Thinking we could do something like this...

Option 1:
- Arrive in Barcelona on 19 September - 6 nights 
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 1 night (breaking up the N to S journey)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 3 nights
- Fly home (13 October)

OR

Option 2:
- Arrive in Madrid on 11 September - 1 night to settle in
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 3 nights 
- Barcelona - 6 nights (quicker trip same day rather than having to arrive the night before directly from San Sebastian and lose a night there)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 1 night
- Fly home (6 October)

All domestic travel by train. 

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1.

t3_1fw3r80,Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else.

t3_1fx4okn,Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues.

t3_1fx6l6t,how much money are you required to have to go from germany to the US?,"So I am very confused. I have never left the US, and have only been to four states here, so I don't know much about travel or anything surrounding it. 

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right?

t3_1fwzwzs,I have both travel insurance and travel benefits from my credit card - claim with both?,"Hi there, long time reader, first time writer :) I can't for the life of me find any information on this on the web and will call someone tomorrow. Just thought I'd throw it out there now and see if anyone has experienced this before:

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both? Just trying to see how to maximize my claims approval since I'm double covered..so why not?

t3_1fwkuuu,The Call of the Road (Croatia),"I remember the first time we hit the road in that old T4 van. Croatia was our starting point, and the Adriatic coast didn’t disappoint. We cruised through winding coastal roads, with the sea sparkling on one side and dramatic cliffs on the other. Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot. A small mechanic in a nearby village became our savior, and after a few laughs (and a couple of beers shared while he worked), we were back on the road.

t3_1fvoezl,"The Underrated Gems of Cáceres &amp; Merída, Spain","Extremadura is a region in SW Spain that even Spaniards don't visit that much. I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

t3_1fwg3ws,I  need travel destination ideas for a memorable trip with my grandparents. My grandfather was just diagnosed with mild Parkinsons. I don't know how long he will be able to travel as that progresses.  ,"**About travelers**:

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. ",1728094584.0,2024-10-08 10:34:16

I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum
* The Scottish highlands, Wales, the Lake District, Cornwall, the Cotswolds

**4. Japan (1.5 weeks?)**

Similiar to UK, I wanted to stay in Toyko initially, But I feel there's so much to explore in Japan. Really want to fit in time to visit an onsen at least for two days, and do stuff between Toyko and Osaka? Full list of things I want to do:

* Eat tons of sushi, ramen, curry, tempura bowls, and even a fugu sashimi
* Visit to Studio Ghibli Museum
* Visit to Tokyo tower
* Shibuya
* Onsen Trip, as I mentioned
* Shopping for some tax-free items cheaper compare to US; Maybe a Gundam Figure build kit or a Gibson Guitar?",1728102282.0,2024-10-08 10:34:16

When we travel, my partner and I love meeting locals, trying new foods/drinks, love a good view, and learning about history. Looking to avoid long bus rides/travel between sites. 

Day 1: land in Lima around 5pm. Have a nice dinner. 

Day 2: ? Explore Lima. We love experiencing food and drinks and local culture.. suggestions welcome! 

Day 3: fly to Cusco and stay in Cusco (activity TBD)

Day 4: another day in Cusco (activity TBD). Attend trek briefing. 

Day 5: start the Salkantay trek 

Day 6: Salkantay trek 

Day 7: Salkantay trek 

Day 8: last day of trek, ends at Machu Picchu. Option to go back to Cusco OR we are thinking of taking a little R&amp;R in the sacred valley? Hotel/resort/spa suggestions if so? 

Day 9: ?? Relax in sacred valley or something else 

Day 10: half day relaxing and make way to airport to fly out of Cusco. Sleep in Lima. 

Day 11: fly out of Lima at 1:15pm. 

A couple considerations: 
Should we leave Lima on day 2?
What should we do after the trek? I know we’ll be tired and the sacred valley looks beautiful.. is it worth staying after the trek? Is there a hotel or resort that fits the bill?

I honestly don’t enjoy travelling as much if I would have to frequently move hotels/cities. Despite the rainy season, I still would like to visit the beach when possible.

I’ve had a look at these places and have listed out the particular ones that I would like to visit.

In Bali, I find Gili T, Nusa Penida, Ubud and Uluwatu nice but considering I’m only going for a week I would probably leave Gili T and Nusa Penida out. I am considering Bali but it honestly is my last option as how touristy it is kind of turns me off.

In Vietnam, I would really like to visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Hoi an. I am not sure if this is too many places for one week. Phu quoc is also on the list but I’ve heard it is a tourist trap (?)

Thailand. I haven’t really looked at a particular place in Thailand yet but I am considering visiting Thailand as it would be the “best” time to visit. It would be great if anyone could suggest a 7 day itinerary that won’t include moving around to too many different cities or getting on several domestic planes.

Disclaimer: Maybe this should be for r/ AskA""Nearly""Canadian, but I couldn’t find that particular group! Askacanadian moderated it out and the immigration reddits dont seem to cover it , so apologies for posting something oddly specific in r/travel 

I’m looking to book a sunny getaway this winter for my partner and me from Canada. I noticed there are several countries that a Canadian Permanent Resident can visit with their PR card and passport, even if the passport isn’t super powerful.

Has anyone traveled from Canada to any of these places (with PR card in hand + their *weak* national passport)? Are some more relaxed than others? Any tips or things to avoid (besides the usual travel advice)? I know I need to do more research once we decide, but I’m hoping for some personal experiences with immigration etc., like *how you fared with your all-inclusive trip to Cancun with Transat* or something(definitely avoiding USA stopovers!).

It was never an issue for me with my strong European passport, but I gather it might be trickier for someone with a weaker one like my better half. I just want to understand all the angles before getting her hopes up!  

Here’s the list I found online:

* All Dutch Caribbean territories
* Anguilla
* Bahamas
* Belize

t3_1fw7sg0,Did I get scammed? ,"So I recently canceled a hotel reservation with Expedia. I called the hotel and they gave me a number to call: (888) 432-7981.

Seemed legitimate but due to being impacted by hurricane Helene, I couldn’t provide the confirmation code due to no service or WiFi (called via landline). They gave me a different number and gave me a 50% refund.

This week I had signal and wanted to see if I could get the other 50% as it would be helpful considering the hurricanes impact on us. Called the number above and they worked to see what they could do. They offered me credits for the other half and told me that it would be a $99 service fee for this since it was a manual refund. 

I believe I started to be scammed here.

I gave them my credit card info (I don’t think I should have done this looking back), and they sent me an email from: reservations@thebookingconfirmation.com. It was a receipt and information but it looks shady. The charge on my credit card also shows as: airtktservices(followed by a number). 

What really made me think I just got scammed is they said I would have to call a specific number in order to use the credits: +1-844-202-1445.

My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi. But if I stay in Vleteren, I'll be able to walk there and back, depending on the distance between the hotel and In De Vrede. What do you think is the best way to proceed here?
2. The following day, Tuesday, I'm going to Florenville to visit Orval, in a journey over 5 hours.  So, would you advise me to leave from Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper, Vleteren or whatever?

If you have any tips on beer stores or beers you like to drink that I could buy, I'd be grateful.  
And I hope you can help me clear up my doubts about my itinerary and help me plan my trip.",1728067678.0,2024-10-08 10:34:18

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

t3_1fw509b,Morocco 9-day itinerary tips,"Hi everyone! Me and my partner are going to Morocco for a 9-day trip in November (including travel days), it's our first time there and I would like some tips! It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

  
And if you have any other tips about Morocco and traveling there, please let me know :) ",1728063497.0,2024-10-08 10:34:18

t3_1fw4gfp,Osaka to Bangkok via Shanghai Pudong (2hrs 2 mins layover) NEED ADVICE PLS!,"Hi all,

Osaka to Shanghai Pudong = Peach Aviation (arriving 24:20)

Shanghai Pudong to Bangkok = Thai Lion Air (departing 02:40)

Luggage: HAND CARRY ONLY!

Layover time: 2 hours 20 mins

- Since we don't have any check in luggage, is it possible to just go to the transfer desk and get a boarding pass there? (Note: Thai Lion Air doesn't allow online check in for international flights according to their website)

- If not, do we have to apply for a transit visa just so we can go through immigration and customs and then check in again at the Thai Lion Air counter?

- OR can we just go straight to immigration and customs and they will issue us a transit visa there considering we are not leaving the airport and only getting out of airside so we can check in again?

  
2 hours and 20 mins is not a lot of time so there's gonna be a lot of running.  My mistake in buying this type of ticket &gt;\_&lt;",1728062069.0,2024-10-08 10:34:18

The story should have ended with a refund then and there, but they also let me know they would NOT be refunding the money. They were also unclear on how or where they got my credit card information.

This is where I started digging, and I found **they have been doing this for years!**

I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

t3_1fw7071,"London, Paris, Venice, Rome!","hi guys! new to traveling and my first big trip i'm planning with one of my friends is for summer 2026. we're hoping visit London, Paris, Venice, and Rome. But our dilemma is that we only can afford about 10 days as it looks because we don't wanna be doing hostels and trains/plane fare is rather expensive as it looks for summers in Europe. Just wanted to come onto the subreddit to see if this would even be a possible trip with all of the places we genuinely want to explore. I'm willing to expand the trip up to two days to account for travel. If anyone has any advice regarding trains, planes, itinerary, or just the simple fact that our trip may not be possible, please leave it below! Thanks so much. 

Edit: Okay totally impossible haha. If I I decide to split 10 days into London &amp; Paris, is there anywhere else in France that I could stay &amp; still be able to travel to Paris from? I'm not really looking to stay IN Paris but rather a place a train ride away (personal preference, probably not logical but i don't care much haha). Also any other places in France close by that would be worth seeing if we have leftover time? Thanks for your advice guys!!! ",1728068580.0,2024-10-08 10:34:18

I'm travelling to France tomorrow and I'm travelling outbound on easyjet and inbound on Transavia.
Easyjet allows small cabin bags of 45x36x20cm. I usually take a slightly larger one and have never had a problem.
However, Transavia only allows 40x30x20cm.

I am torn. First about me: (1) No business class (2) I sleep on flights. Not necessarily well but I can pass out for an entire 7 hour red eye flight. (3) I have been to Frankfurt before.

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

Some people say just get it over with and do one really long flight. Thoughts?

We're looking for romance, privacy, healing. A day spent reading, strolling a trail, and having healthy food would be the perfect day.

Would also love: horses or other animals, no kids, yoga

let me introduce myself. hi, i am 25 and just graduated uni. after a long time dreaming, i decided to finally go on the trip of my dreams. we visited 8 countries and rode planes, buses, trains, ferries, we did it all. really it was an amazing trip, but i come back home feeling more empty than ever. my friends fought the whole time, my one friend had a meltdown in each country we visited about random stuff, i felt stressed and annoyed a lot of the time. 

we don’t live in the same province and now that i am back home (i still live my parents:( ) and away from my friends i just.. idk. i’m left to figure things out again, but im more broke than ever now. i just feel the crushing weight of having to pay my bills and catch up with everyone who stayed and continued their normal lives while i disconnected from everything and now still feel disconnected af. i also left my job to do this (i didn’t wanna work there for long anyway) so i also am jobless😭

t3_1fueq0d,Ten days in Brazil 🇧🇷 ,"Recently I had the chance to visit Brazil and wanted to share some of my picture and experiences.  I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

t3_1fv2ci5,2 month train loop of France,"Hi everyone, I am in the beginning stages of planning a 1-2 month trip around France next September entirely by rail. I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille.

My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out. 

- assuming my flights go without delay, I will arrive at the airport at 10:30pm and my car rental from fox is scheduled to be picked up at 11:30pm. I am worried I didn’t give myself enough time to deal with finding my checked bags and dealing with customs or whatever. Can I just call the place in advance if I’m running late?

- We are scheduled to stay at the Luxor hotel for the first 3 nights but we will only most likely be checking in at like midnight - 1am the first night. Is this worth calling them in advance?

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

t3_1fvi4bm,Should we visit Krakow or Wroclaw?,"Hi all,

Me and a group of friends are organising a trip to Poland in late November and are trying to decide between Krakow or Wroclaw.

The one bit of extra info I’m curious to hear about (besides all the basic stuff like which is better, is one cheaper than the other etc) is one of the group mentioned that Krakow is conservative and slightly homophobic, can anyone speak to this one way or the other?

My personal preference is to go to Krakow but curious to hear people’s thoughts.

The trip has come up quite suddenly, so I haven't had a ton of time to do research yet. I would appreciate anyone's comments, additions, or suggestions regarding the interary I've put together.  At the moment, I only have a flight into the north and out of the south booked, but I need to submit an address for my evisa, so I'd like to have at least my first hotel sorted out soon. 

I've never been to Vietnam, so all I know about now are the main points which I read about online. The buses looked interesting, but considering the low cost of domestic flights, and the long distances, I think we will just plan to fly between the major cities. I am not sure if it is best to spend so long in HCMC, or if we should spread some of those days to a different city. We are interested in historical places/museums, shorter hikes, beaches, and good food. Also, any additional tips about day trips from the big cities would be awesome!
Thanks in advance!

2nd/3rd - Hanoi
4/5th - Ha Long bay

t3_1fv8yyh,Help my expand my Asia trip,"Hi, I am a single 36M from the UK and I have booked my first solo trip (hurray!) to Japan some weeks ago. Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

Also happily take alternative itineraries! Other countries I find interesting are Vietnam,  China and Indonesia.

t3_1fvboxg,Late December trip suggestion ,"Hello everyone,

I’m planning my winter holidays and need some advices

contexte : I am a 30 French woman from Paris and I have some holidays from the 19th till the 1st of january 2025, I might extend them till the 13th as the 13th is my bday i want to be away for this. So its between the 19th till 13th January.  
i’ll travel solo and have a budget of \~2500. My non-négociable is : nothing COLD, for me winter holidays are to go as much as possible from the gloomy weather, a little break from the winter depression.  
i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

Sorry for the long post, I welcome all feedback/ suggestions. Any help welcome !

t3_1fvauvm,4-Day Trip in Late October - Iceland or Tromsø Without a Car? Need Recommendations!,"Hey fellow travelers!

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

Any thoughts or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much!",1727970283.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting.

t3_1fvpzkk,Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

t3_1fv6h7f,VAT refund Barcelona Airport Experience ,"I’m traveling with my mother in barcelona. I’m flying home earlier than my mother while she continues her travels. She placed all of her purchases under my passport and I am planning to attempt a VAT refund by myself (I will not be taking all items purchased with me, they’re all smaller items and can also claim they are items I already have if they do ask) She said some airports are more relaxed and did not need to show all items when submitting for the refund. How has your experiences been in the past with the Barcelona airport? Did you really need to show all of the items? I’m just planning on checking the items that I’m bringing with me so will do this prior to security. 

I’ve also read some threads that said there are locations in barcelona that stamp the receipts before the airport so you do not need to check the items there. Can you do this before your day of departure and how does that work? Would you suggest this instead?

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1727943901.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19

Im very young obviously so money is scarce, i’ll have enough for the flights, and i’ve made the budget of $1000 for accommodation/food. I plan on staying in cheap hotels / hostels most of the time, with thailand being the only exception as it is so cheap there to book a decent airbnb.

Im very early into the planning, and i will most likely get this trip done in either January or February. With the months in consideration, i know i might have to remove/add some destinations i just havent thought of yet. Thats were this post comes in!

t3_1fv2xqr,Has anyone from outside Germany ever processed a paper DB (Deutsche Bahn) compensation claim?,"So long story short DB owes me some €300 (cancelled trains and overnight stranding). It's been 2 months and all that has happened so far is this:

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point).",1727943868.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? ",1727895112.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19

We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

Thank you for any advice you are able to give!",1727878443.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19
t3_1fueo5c,"Travel Plan from Santa Maria CA, to Las Vegas, to the Grand Canyon","I have this travel plan set for February. I chose this month because in my occupation that's the slowest work month and leaving at that particular time wouldn't be a big burden on the company. And the state I live in gets extremely cold and depressing during that month, so I figured this would be an ideal time to escape. I have this travel plan set for an entire week (Monday through Sunday). 

My plan is to fly to Santa Maria, California. Get a hotel and a rental car. Stay there for about two days, and then drive on out to Las Vegas and stay there for about two or three days, and then end off the trip in Arizona at the Grand Canyon. 

Thoughts? Advice? ",1727871130.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19
t3_1fu7vaf,"Mainly for European travelers but, has anyone had an experience where they are asked for Identification by police or other institutions and could only provide a Drivers’ License?","
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;
Paying for a parking ticket in Verona (through post office);
Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened? Were you fined? Jailed? Were you refused admission or services to something? How were you able to correct the issue?",1727842783.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19

t3_1fulk74,China eastern or air China for flying to japan?,"Flying London to Tokyo 

Do I go via Shanghai PVG with China Eastern, or via Beijing PEK with Air China? Same price pretty much. But not going via either of these options is more than £500 more.

Main thing I care about is not being delayed and stuck there, and getting my baggage. I'm especially nervous reading how long transit takes in China itself, and apparently delays are more common in Beijing. Has anyone had experiences flying with either on this route? I've searched the sub and found some experiences but not totally on these routes, they vary a lot, and are quite old. How long do I need for transfer? Also, I've heard long transfers of 10hrs or so cause problems with check in, has anyone encountered this?

Also, can you select seats easily? Flying is 6000x more tolerable with a window seat for me.",1727889303.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19
t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place",1727805935.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you.",1727936827.0,2024-10-08 10:34:19

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

It says the visa status is 'in effect' and lists the date I can enter from. Is this all I need to enter into Australia as I noticed the letter contains no QR code unlike most visas. Also I hear the waiting time for a Australian visa can take a few months so is the Vevo and visa different from one another. Thanks for any advice,1727860428.0,2024-10-08 10:34:20
t3_1fua7nv,Visiting India as a Dutch National but of Pakistani origin ,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently living in the Netherlands (since past 7 years), and I’ve renounced my Pakistani nationality few years ago. I’ve traveled to about 35 countries across Europe, Asia, and America, and one destination I’ve always wanted to explore is India. I’ve heard so many wonderful things about the cities, culture, and landscapes from my Indian friends here in the Netherlands, which has made me even more eager to visit. I’ve actually wanted to travel to India for quite some time now, to experience everything I’ve heard about firsthand.

I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into how difficult or easy it might be to get a visa for India as someone of Pakistani origin? Are there any specific restrictions or places I might not be able to visit because of my background?

I’m just looking for any helpful information or experiences regarding the visa process and any potential travel limitations. I would really appreciate your advice. I’m approaching this with the utmost respect and a genuine desire to explore and learn.

Thanks so much in advance for your help!

t3_1ftl7an,Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.",1727780037.0,2024-10-08 10:34:20

t3_1fu4hfm,Solo traveler planning Alsace wine + foodie trip 12/2 - 12/5. Recommendations please!,"I'm a 38/F planning a solo trip to Alsace in early December and am trying to figure out my itinerary including where to stay, eat, and the best options for visiting wineries! I'm hoping for some recommendations on how to cut costs where possible and spend more where it counts.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne. Historically I've done semi-private tours but I'd definitely be open to saving money if I can get around by myself either via car or the Kut'Zig - I'm not sure if there are wineries that are easy to access/open to the public or by appointment to someone outside the industry.

I also would love to hit up the Strasbourg Christmas market for maybe an afternoon, but wine, food, and wandering/exploring are higher priorities for this trip vs. more ""touristy"" activities like visiting castles, etc. 

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access. Wherever I stay, I'll mainly be there just to sleep but it's important that it's safe and clean, but would flex for the right experience (again as long as I can make up for added costs elsewhere!) Equally open to hotels or airbnbs.

* Is Midtown the best to stay for convenience?
* I've got a long list of things to see and do for NY, what about NJ? And can we get there on public transport of should we hire a car?
* I was going to book for February/March time. We're quite comfortable with it being on the cold side and would rather it be chilly with less crowds. I was wondering whether as it is out of season will stuff be closed? Or will we be okay?

t3_1fuclqp,"7-9 days in Argentina, what to do?","Im currently looking at a cruise that is from Europe to Argentina. I Would love to see moet of Argentina and want to add about a week there (7-9 days). Im going there with my wife. We are both mid 20s.

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days? 

Budget: im hoping to get the price under 2.000$ just for this week for hotels, food and daily activities.

Since we are probably not going there anytime soon anymore we would like to add as much as possible.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass.

t3_1fu7qpc,Iberia Missed Connection and Cancelled Flight ,"Hello Everyone, 

Long time lurker and first time poster looking for some guidance please. 

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

t3_1fu4o30,What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible. 

I posted on my Instagram story what happened and had 13 ppl reaching out that they went through the same thing with AirSerbia :(((((/ one of my friend who is originally from Belgrade sent me an email address that is at their LOST AND FOUND office door in Belgrade ( ???? ) and after I sent an email there, they responded that my baggage was still in Belgrade ( ???? ). When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!!

t3_1ft24dp,"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

I'm kicking off a solo adventure around a few spots in SEA with a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and was wondering if its worth staying in a hostel or if I should just go with a regular hotel. Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

To travelers who have been to KL before, is it worth trying to stay in a hostel or should I just play it safe and start off in a hotel?

t3_1fu03t7,Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?",1727819290.0,2024-10-08 10:34:20

t3_1fst66x,"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",1727695522.0,2024-10-08 10:34:20

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

t3_1fsu2ec,Hotel / Resort fees getting out of control?,"
Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

My only requests for this trip are trying a NYC hotdog and a slice of pizza (LOL), seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, going to the American Museum of Natural History, and finding some good dessert spots/other eateries. He is not a sweets/sugar person so he has left me in charge of that.

Dates: January 10-12, 2025. We are planning to arrive between 9:30am-10:00am on Friday and depart around 2:00pm on Sunday. 

Stay: we have yet to book the hotel but we will be staying right in Times Square 

What he has discussed booking so far: going to MoMA, American Museum of Natural History, two evening shows (a play off Broadway and the blue man group), either Little Italy or China Town, shopping on 5th avenue, and a few restaurants he really wants me to try as they are favorites of his. 

As this is my first time going, we’re trying to hit some really key spots while also not overwhelming either of us since we really only have 2.5 days there.  If anyone can give any recommendations given the time of the year or other tips, I would greatly appreciate it!

I am planning a trip to Morocco and in my plan, I'll take the ferry from Tangier to Tarifa, then local transportation to Malaga. Simple answer to this route, rather than just fly away, is that I wan to try something fun, and the Strait of Gilbralter is on my checklist as well. The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

However, I'd like to consult your experiences if I should do Tangier-Tarifa or TangierMed-Algeciras. For now I choose Tangier-Tarifa since it's 40-60 min ferry plus 30-50 min bus, shorter than TangierMed-Algeciras with 20-30min ride plus 2.5hr ferry. I will be staying in the town of Tangier, for the eve.

Besides, I am a bit uncertain about the local transportation between Tarifa and Algeciras. Rome2Rio tells me that there are regular bus routs operated by local transportation company. My concern is that what about the fare and how should I pay the ticket? Does it take credit card? or I should buy the ticket somewhere?

After arriving Malaga, I will be staying Malaga for 2 nights and then fly back. Should I book my day tour to Granada and Alhambra?

I wanted to get any feedback on our high level itinerary. We will be arriving Sunday Oct 13th and travelling by train (Swiss Travel Pass). 

We have a pretty good idea of our daily activities but honestly I've tried to avoid planning TOO much which removes free time for exploring. My girlfriend and I like planning the next day the night before, talking to concierge for local recs, etc. Here is what I have: 

Day 1 (Oct 13): PM - arrive late to Montreux from Geneva, dinner. 

Day 2: AM - Walk to Chillon Castle, boat tour if time/weather line up. 
PM: Lavaux vineyards walk (Cully -Saint Saphorin). Dinner there/Montreux. 

Day 3: Gruyeres - chateau du Gruyeres, HR Giger Museum (we are Alien fans lol), etc. Train back to Montreux/dinner 

Day 4: AM - train to Zermatt 
PM - Stellisee lake weather permitting/Zermatt bopping 

Day 5: AM - Early Gornergrat, Riffelsee, proposal 🥳. Matterhorn glacier if time/weather 
PM: BEAUSite spa. Dinner at Omnia. 

Day 6: AM - train to Wengen. 
PM: Mannlichen-kleine schedegg if weather permits/lauterbrunnen valley option 

Day 7: (all options) Murren North face hiking, gimmewald, Eiger Trail, schilthorn, jungfraujoch

Day 8: see day 7. Mix/match accordingly 

Day 9: AM - lauterbrunnen valley 1 last time. Train to Lucerne. 
PM - bop around Lucerne 

Day 10: Lucerne City exploring. Old village, museums, boating weather permitting, etc. 

Day 11: rigi/pilatus/stoos ridge (still deciding - open to suggestions). 

Day 12: AM: train to Zurich (maybe stop in Zug for lunch??). 
PM: bop around Zurich 

Day 13: Zurich exploring, museums etc. 

Day 14: depart 

Weather may dictate some of these days. Have thought about training to Bern on any rainy days or other locations. We are pretty flexible and enjoy both hiking and city exploring. Have lived in Colorado for many years and understand October hiking will be layers, beanies, gloves.

Something that's important to me is possibly being able to get assistance. I'm autistic, I can take care of myself so it's not a necessity but it'd help a lot.

I am writing today to tell you that the trip I enjoyed the most and had the great pleasure of going on was a trip to Newfoundland, Canada. We spent 3 days in St. John's, the provinincial capital, then rented a car and drove near 4 hours to Bonavista. The countryside was glorious. We stopped at breweries and in a few small towns. Once at our destination, we took day trips to various fishing and artesenal villages. We were out in the sea just meters from the whales. We spent an afternoon watching the Puffins. The people were awesome, probably some of the nicest people in the world, no joke. At one air bnb, a cottage, we befriended the neighbours who invited us to their nightly bonfire with family, friends, and moonshine. The month was August, and the weather was lovely. We had such a fantastic time and hope that you do too :) If I had to move and could go anywhere, I would choose Newfoundland. ",1727663025.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

My mother is traveling to India for an emergency. I looked this up online and the website I posted above popped up.  Very poorly designed, by the way. Looks like it was designed by a 12 year old. 

Anyway, I created her application, uploaded her photo and passport page and paid the $40 USD fee. Less than 24 hours later, saw the visa was granted. 

Is this too good to be true or a scam? I don't want to book her ticket, have her show up at the airport, and this isn't even legit. The Indian embassy is useless here too, as there is no number to call, and if you make an appointment, they can barely speak English or convey anything properly.

I asked the employee who was escorting everyone where I should be and he said to line D. I asked 4 people in my line where they were going they all said the same place im going. So I said great I'm in the right spot. However, both those lines were going on 2 separate buses to the same place. When it came time to scan my ticket the driver said ""this isn't your bus"". I said how? I was told to come to this line and it's going to my destination. He said you missed your bus. And no, I did not come late. I was an hour in half early, my bus literally left minutes before. I asked can he please let me on the bus he said ""how much you got"" and was saying other very rude stuff to me but I digress. I lied and said I only have $20 so I gave him cash for him to let me on the bus. 

I contacted greyhound only wanting to get a partial refund of $20 on my ticket but they are of course saying it's nonrefundable. How is this my fault at all? Their app clearly said get in line D or E and the employee told me line D. The employees didn't even do calls for which bus is going where. You just had to assume what like to get in. 

The bus I got into by minutes managed to get to my destination so I was able to get onto the connecting bus. Which is why I asked for only a partial refund. But do I have grounds for a charge back? ",1727796666.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

t3_1ft5pl2,7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)",1727728123.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

I have a question regarding a recent flight I got
From Hong Kong to Melbourne, Australia. 

I attempted to purchase 100 grams of tobacco from Hong Kong airport, well aware of the 25g limit when entering into Australia. 

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. ",1727729597.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

I went to Japan last year and Google Fi was a nightmare. The 'unlimited data' quickly became very, very limited. Very spotty. Very bad overall. On top of this, I have been having a LOT of issues with google support, my support being dropped every single month on renewal so I need to keep reaching out to re-activate it, and it's such a complete bother and mess.

So what I am looking for is:

* A switchable plan to which I can have full unlimited global data support should I need it. A plan that ideally will have fair or really reliable international support.
* A steady plan to use for simple calls and texts, with either cheap or pay-by-use data plans. Or if there's a cheap option that still has data, that's good too.
* A good customer service that's easy to work with.
* A plan that will actually not have these disconnection/renewal problems every month.
* The ability to carry over my number.
* eSims (ideally but not necessary)

I get that its a level 4 travel advisory and honestly a huge part of my brain is screaming at me to not go but I also don't know if its something I can avoid. My grandmother who spent years in the united states and played a large part in raising both my sister and me moved back to Caracas in 2012/2013ish. She was not here legally and I don't think there is likely any chance of her being allowed back into the united states. She is mostly blind and has a hard time moving around so I also don't think it would be feasible to have her travel elsewhere and meet her somewhere outside of the country. But I am also in tears thinking about not being able to see her at least one last time and I really don't know what to do. I'm scared of being kidnapped or falsely imprisoned or worse. I am white as hell and barely speak Spanish (understand a bit just cant speak much) which absolutely doesn't help.

t3_1fsu1jf,Vienna or Amsterdam as a female solo traveler (in July)?,"Hi! I’m a uni student who’s planning on solo traveling next summer - early July to be specific. 

I would like to visit Vienna or Amsterdam but can’t decide… I need to fly on Lufthansa so it would be Munich-Vienna or Frankfurt-Amsterdam. 

(I’ve been to Munich and Frankfurt and will only spend a day or two so both doesn’t really matter)

I’ve been to Vienna (and other cities in Austria) as well but it was when I was younger, and I think the familiarity would help me on my first ever solo trip. 

I’ve never been to Netherlands, so it would be nice to have a new experience. Plus I will visit Rotterdam as well if I choose this. 

Things I have to consider:

Accommodation - I want clean and safe hotel. Novotel or other 4 star business hotels. But I heard Amsterdam is more expensive than Vienna…

Racism &amp; Overall Safety - I’m an Asian woman so… I never had unpleasant experience in any part of Austria but was wondering about Amsterdam. 

Sightseeing - My visit will be about a week long and won’t move around the country so it would be nice if the city is filled with tourist attractions. 

Any suggestions? Thanks!",1727698494.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

Option # 1: Stay at a vineyard/resort that has a spa and activities like wine tour, horeback riding, etc. all on the resort. More expensive option

  
Option # 2: Stay in a hotel in Mendoza city and take day trips to thermal hot springs, horseback riding, wine tour, etc.

The resort option sounds nice, but I worry about limiting ourselves to the resort itself and not being able to experience some of the more well known restaurants in the city or other activities.

Has anyone traveled to Mendoza before and have any input on whether we should stay in the city and be open to any restaurant/activity we'd like or if it would be better to book one of the resort type options?

1.	Split my time evenly between Madrid and another city - I’m thinking Barcelona, Valencia, or Seville, or even crossing into Porto (though I’ve been there before)
2.	Stay in Madrid for the full week and take day/overnight trips to surrounding towns (Toledo, Sergovia, Salamanca).

My first day off will be next Friday (11/10) and my flight home from Madrid to London is 3pm the next Saturday (19/10). I’ve heard that 8 days is too much time for Madrid but I’m worried that things will be too rushed if I visit a second city but only spend 4 days in each.

Because of the flight schedule, I must start and end the trip in Madrid. I like walking and street photography, and I can speak basic Spanish. I also want to keep costs low so I’ll probably be staying in hostels for the entire trip.

Me (F23) and my parents (\~60) are looking to go on a trip for the holidays \~Dec 23-Jan 1 and are really curious about Tbilisi/surrounding areas. Thank you for reading over this slightly long post as I would love to hear from locals/people who have visited before. Would love some pretty honest/frank responses if it isn't a good idea to visit, for whatever reason.

* I haven't really seen a lot online about East Asians visiting Tbilisi, so was wondering if there's any air of hostility towards visitors who are Chinese. We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year. We only speak English (and Chinese but obviously won't be helpful in Georgia!)

t3_1fru0rh,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",1727575803.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21
t3_1fswfii,Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia. 

I would love any feedback, location suggestions, or just to hear your favorite places to spend a week! Thanks!!",1727705308.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21
t3_1fti8de,Is it okay to book 2 accomodations in case one is a scam?,"Hi, this is my very first time going on a trip outside of my country so i'm sorry if i ask stupid questions.

t3_1ft9id1,Bachelor Party Recommendations? (I'm the Last to Get Married),"So, I'm the last to get married among my group of guy friends and the last to try to plan a bachelor party. Admittedly, I've fallen a bit behind on planning something (I get married in May 2025). My fiance and I have another trip planned in March 2025 (Mexico), so I'm looking at either February or April for when to travel.

Among my friends, we've already done Vegas, Destin, Nashville, Charleston, hometown, and many who have elected to do nothing (multiple elopements and a Covid wedding). It's a group of roughly 10-12 guys. We are all in our early 30s. We're into good food and drinks, games (any kind, I've seen them turn a bottle cap into a drinking game), professional (and unprofessional?) sports, beaches, pools, and water activities. Not big clubbers, golfers, or hikers.

Personally, I love to cook, I like a boat and a lake, to visit an art museum, I tend to be nerdier, and my games of preference are card and board game.

Things that have been batted around in conversation: Ireland (too far for the dads), Montreal, Banff, Lake Tahoe, All Inclusive Resort (don't know where), Lakeside Cabin (don't know where), Austin, Chicago. Not sure if those primers help!

* Dates: February or April 2025
* Locations: Canada, USA, Central America, Caribbean
* Group Details: 10-12, 30ish yo Males, located on East Coast USA
* Vibes: Beers, Good Food, Games/Group Activities, Water (a plus, not necessary)
* Not Vibes: Clubs, Golf Courses, Appalachian Trail

t3_1ft45ni,Where to solo travel for 5 nights in late October for some type I fun?,"I have a week off between jobs and want to make the most of it, but my husband won't be able to join me. I have done some solo travel before and have learned that I'm happiest with small group tasks/activities during the day, otherwise I get a bit aimless and lonely. I am outdoorsy but more into type I versus type II fun. I'm fairly competent on bikes and horses and hikes, but I don't want to summit any mountains and I get lonely camping alone.  I live in a city and prefer nature when I travel.

  
Given all of this and my late October timeframe, any ideas on where to go?  I am on the east coast of the USA and would prefer to remain within a reasonably easy flight (while avoiding any areas that are at a high risk of a hurricane).  I am seriously craving sun after the recent weather here, post Helene.  I can comfortably spend 2-3K on this trip.

We’d love to take a proper break of ca. 3 weeks, but looking for ideas. We’re from the UK and the thought of going somewhere else cold to just “hunker down” sounds awful to me.. I already trapped at home and don’t want to be trapped indoors somewhere else slightly more cosy.

Ideas are either:
A) Somewhere super relaxing but hot so it’s a change and we can go in a pool / chill outdoors. 
In my head this would mean going quite far to say Bali or Mexico…

B) Say f*** it and be those people that take a baby to Japan because I’m dying to go.

C) Road trip round the states
Can’t decide if this is stupid given we can only drive 2 hours before taking breaks with the baby… 

D) Alternative ideas in Europe that avoid a longer flight?!

Would love suggestions on baby-friendly trips / what’s realistically going to be a great trip, even if different to how we travelled pre-baby.

t3_1ftfa1m,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",1727755390.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

t3_1fszza8,Anniversary trip - northern lights or safari or ???,"10 year anniversary is coming up and can't decide on a destination. We're leaving our 3yo at home with the grandparents and this might be one of our last kid-free trips. I'm torn between wanting to make the most of it and actually relaxing. Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

Feedback please. Would you choose the northern lights trip knowing that you might not see anything? I think the safari is doable with a teenager but I don't think I would take my kid on a northern lights trip.",1727714109.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

I've read that I need approval to bring a drone into Zimbabwe. I think the process is to get approval from the CAAZ and then use that to get a temporary import permit from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.

I have tried several times to contact the CAAZ to get approval and pay the registration fee but have gotten nowhere. I've contacted the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and they've advised me to ""bring all relevant paperwork and apply for an Application for Temporary Importation Privilege"" at the port of entry.

The drone will be in my carry on and I'm not even sure they scan carry on bags on arrival, that said I'd still rather abide by the regulations but they're not making it easy.

t3_1ft0ar7,"I need some ""comfort"" advice and some ways to up my travel game","I have been travelling a lot the last few years ( 5 cities in canada, Cuba twice, Italy, Portland/San fransisco, Greece, Germany and this coming april, France) and have learned a LOT about efficientcy in packing, my personal travel style and what I need and dont need when I travel.  I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.  Even if I pack clothes for almost every day I am travelling its inevitable you wear something more than once so I figure why even worry about having so much?",1727714886.0,2024-10-08 10:34:21

Although I said no budget, we don’t actually have unlimited money so it would only be one of each archetypal activity (museum, play, fine dining, tour(?)).

We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)
17th: Overnight train to Ninh Binh

22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa

Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

t3_1fsqxf2,Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?

Could I have some opinions on how our itinerary looks so far? 
Our main priority is New York which we don’t want any less time in. 
We don’t really want to skip any places but just want to know if the amount of time we’re spending in each place sounds like enough or if it’s too much. 
We land and leave from LA - hence why we’re back there at the end. 
We won’t be using a car and will be flying to each place.

I'm an avid traveler. I usually like to keep my flights tracked through apps. I'm not too concerned with tracking hotel stays or car rental stuff, but it's good when I need it. I usually stay at Hilton hotels and use Avis for car rentals. Unless something unusual makes me deviate from either brand, I'm sticking to them. Flights on the other hand, are usually across many airlines. I like to keep a history of my flights too, just to see where I've been, so I do like the passport feature from Flighty.

I recently discovered Tripsy, I like the UI and I like the general itinerary record. I see that there is a flight/visited record feature, so that's a nice feature. This app reminds me of TripIt. I've used TripIt before, I didn't like the UI though. I didn't like the feel of the TripIt app, but I did love their website, which I ended up using far more than the app. One really great feature, although it's a pro feature, is the expense record keeping of Tripsy. It's really nice to see that immediately and not have to do that on the budgeting app.

I could go on and on about both apps. Again, I've used TripIt, I'm favoring Tripsy out of those two. But what are your thoughts of flight/itenarary keeping of both Flighty and Tripsy? Specifically, I'm thinking of getting a pro membership, so which one feels like you're getting your monies worth?

t3_1froz5i,Money comments on having just returned from a trip to the UK.,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks in the UK, mostly touring by train and car. Wonderful trip but I noticed two things I didn't expect.

The UK was expensive! I would rank it right up there with Switzerland. We stayed in three star hotels and B&amp;B's, rated 8.0 or higher on Booking. We paid US$350 per night in London and Edinburgh, US$250 or less in the countryside, breakfast included. Restaurant prices were high too, we paid pound for dollar. Meaning that a pasta dish would cost GBP20, which is US$26. A burger might be GBP16 = US$21. Gasoline cost around US$8.50 per US gallon. Entrance fees for attractions were high, up significantly from the Rick Steve's prices we saw in a four year old book. Like US$40 to see Stonehenge. Museums in London were still free.

British restaurants have caught the tipping disease. They use hand held. point of sale devices for card payments (normal) and the bill almost always included an ""optional service charge"" of 10%. The server would point out that it's optional but there it was, already added into the bill. Incidentally, quite a few restaurants, pubs and deli's are cashless. It was payment by card only. If you go make sure you have a chip card. (Pay toilets in the parks cost 20 pence to use and no longer accept coins. You have to tap your credit card -- chip -- and you're in. It shows up as a 27 cent charge on your CC bill.)

Transportation: The train was expensive too, although we didn't try to book ahead to save money and did walk-up ticket purchases. London to York cost US$94 per person, second class. Car rental was a pleasant surprise. We reserved with Enterprise from the US five months before the trip and were pleased with both the price and the service. And you don't need an Oyster card for the London underground anymore. You can use a chip card in the same way and you get the same fare as with an Oyster card. You just tap in and tap out.

t3_1frdbjj,Brussels is Terrible,"Brussels was... underwhelming 

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels. 

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.  

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert. 

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck. 

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? ",1727526963.0,2024-10-08 10:34:22

t3_1fsnq7t,Charging US Phones in a Country with 220V Electricity Supply,"I have heard some contradicting opinions. Hoping to get a more clear answer here.

I am travelling to a region where the electricity supply is 220V.

I have a Samsung Galaxy phone. The OEM phone charger is dual voltage 100V - 240V. So no problem there. All I need is a suitable plug adapter so I can plug the OEM charger in their wall socket. 

Then I find a plug adapter on Amazon that has also a built-in USB port in additional to the regular US receptacles. The seller makes it very clear that this is just a plug adapter but not a voltage converter. 

Some people say because the adapter doesn't convert the voltage from 220V to 110V, I should plug your phone into the OEM phone charger (which take either voltage) and then plug the OEM phone charger into the wall socket via the plug adapter.

However, other people say you can skip the OEM phone charger and plug the phone directly into the USB ports using just the USB cord. They claim that even though the adapter isn't a voltage converter but the USB port will only output 5V, so the phone is safe.

Who is correct? Any real life experience?

t3_1fsjkpr,Destination indecision - thoughts wanted,"Hoping for some insight! Talking a two week trip at the end of November but can’t decide where. Getting close to being too late.

About me:

Traveling alone, single mid 40s male.

East Coast USA based.

Generally I love big cities but I also lean much more towards relaxing more than adventure. Beaches are ok. Hiking does nothing for me.

Which also means I generally don’t like more than 2 cities. 3 at a push. 1 is even fine if there are a bunch of day trips.

Museums are ok. Love street food and foodie stuff (non gourmet) in general.

Love things like replica markets. Love places like Akihabara.

Love animals so something like a town full of deer or monkeys or seeing elephants etc sounds great.

Pretty tall so long haul is hell unless I get a bulk head seat. This makes flights more expensive for me due to buying upgrades to get those seats.

Safety is huge for me. Hence why Colombia or Brazil or something doesn’t really interest me.

Would enjoy some dates while on vacation. At the very least mingling with locals. I love meeting people from different countries.

Destinations I’m considering most:

Asia:
Usually prefer Asia. 

Have been to Japan 3x already. Over a month in Tokyo, couple weeks in Osaka. Have been to Yokohama, Kyoto, Nara, and Kyoto already. I could spend a year in Tokyo honestly. But also feel like I should go see more places which would be Hiroshima, Nagoya, or Hokkaido next, preference wise. I also am conversational in Japanese and have a friend I might be able to see a couple days there. It also feels like a waste to learn Japanese and then not go to Japan. But it also feels silly on the other hand to only ever go to Japan. Catch-22 I guess. 

Philippines. Beaches! Manila looks chaotic but fun. People seem insanely friendly. Cebu area couple be cool. I’ve kind of been scared off of the infrastructure there but I don’t think that’s a huge deal just sort of an annoyance.

Thailand. 3 messages a day sounds great. Easy metro in Bangkok. My favorite type of food is Thai. Amazing looking old ruins and temples. This was my first plan before I started second guessing myself.

Vietnam maybe. Love the food.

However, SE Asia in general is about 30-35 hours each way which one, is insane (Japan is only around 17) and two, I lose two to three days of vacation to planes and airports. I also don’t sleep almost at all on planes so i might be going days without more than a few hours sleep and lose even more vacation time.


Americas:

Costa Rica. Just seems nice. I don’t know.  But is two weeks here too much?

Europe:

Portugal. Have always wanted to go. Looks great. Affordable.  Great food. Also I have a friend who would come see me for a weekend here which could be fun. 

Spain? So many great cities to see like Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastien, etc.

Italy. Would love to see Tuscany and Rome and Naples. Pompeii is a major bucket list place. Great food. Bucket list in general it’s freaking Italy. The ruins, the museums, the food, the countryside, it all just seems great. Same friend that would meet me for a weekend in Portugal would also be willing to meet for a weekend in Italy. 

But I’ve been hemming and hawing for like six weeks now. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m annoying friends by constantly talking about it and changing my preference even multiple times a day. I just cannot make my mind up. So figured I’d get some advice from people that have done a lot of traveling on here. Or even people that haven’t and just have opinions! I have to make a decision soon or I’m gonna screw up and see nothing but way overpriced flights. I’m already getting close to that I feel like.

Any thoughts or help making a decision or advice on the act of making a travel decision, which never used to be this hard I’m not sure why I’m torturing myself this year, is appreciated!",1727657972.0,2024-10-08 10:34:22

I'll be getting back to Bangkok in mid March and then I'll have about 4 weeks before I fly to New Delhi (from wherever I end up at)

I was initially planning to go down to Phuket briefly to check out Khao Sok for a few days and then use Koh Lanta as my base to check out the Thai islands for about 10 days since Phuket just doesn't sound like my thing. Afterwards I would go to Singapore for a few days and then Malaysia for just under 2 weeks.

However, Western Malaysia is supposed to be super wet in April and I've already been to jungles in central America and will in Vietnam and Thailand as well, so I don't know if it will be worth it. I'm also not sure if there will be enough to do without breaking the bank to spend 10 days on Koh Lanta, so I may have anywhere from 8-16 extra days to do something that is a cheap plane ride from Phuket/Singapore/KL.

t3_1fs9ju6,Visiting Miami from Ireland at the End of October – Any Tips/Suggestions for My 6-Day Itinerary?,"\*\*Dia duit mo chairde!\*\* (That's ""Hello my friends!"" in Irish)

As the title suggests, I will visit your fine city at the end of October. I'm really looking forward to the trip as it will be my first time in Miami, albeit I've been to Florida (Daytona, Tampa and Orlando) when I was younger.

Although there's a small group of us travelling, we each arrive on different days, which has given me plenty of time in advance to draw up a plan of things I'd like to see and do. I've also booked some activities in advance.

If you'd be so kind, I'd like the people of this subreddit to review my itinerary, offer some suggestions of things I should add or remove, provide some general advice about the city and overall, provide some constructive feedback. This trip wasn't cheap, and Miami is a city I've always wanted to see, so I want to ensure it goes as well as possible! The primary reason I'm travelling is to see my favourite NFL team (The Arizona Cardinals) take on your Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.

I've reviewed some tourism posts within this subreddit over the past few months and have also come across some fantastic suggestions from users, so thank you for that!

Below, I'll try and go into as much detail as possible regarding what I plan to do over the six days. Please also forgive me in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors I may have mistyped. I've been reviewing this post for about an hour to make sure it's perfect (This is my third read-through..). Anyway, I hope this post doesn't end up too long, boring or deleted by the Mods. So without further ado, please see below:

# Day 1 - Coral Gables

I arrive at Miami International Airport at 5:30 PM and will have to go through immigration. I hope this doesn't take too long! From there, I plan to take an Uber or Lyft to my accommodation. This should only take about 15-20 minutes according to Google Maps.

Once checked into my hotel in West Flagler, the plan is to take an Uber or Lyft to the Coral Gables area to explore some bars. Clubbing isn't my scene, so dive bars where I can watch sports and talk to people are right up my street. (Is this called a 'Dive bar?')

I'm going to a bar called... ""The Bar"" followed by John Martin's Irish bar. If I have the time, I might go to Tap42 bar. I also think I'll stick to bottles of beer while in Miami, as I don't want to end up a sloppy drunk. I like Miller and Bud Light, which I think most bars in the city provide.

After, It's another Uber/Lyft to Se7as bar, which looks like great fun according to Google. Since I'm Irish, I then plan to visit Duffy's Tavern - which looks like such a chill spot.

And that's about as exciting as Day 1 gets! It will probably be after 7 PM by the time I get to leave the hotel, and I'll probably be tired after travelling by air all day. As for food, I'll eat in one or two of the bars.

# Day 2 -Little Havana and Downtown

If I've time, I'll visit a grocery store to pick up a few snacks. The hotel provides plenty, but I'll still make the visit for a basic shop.

I'll then head to Little Havana (I'll walk if I'm okay for time) as I've booked a Walking Tour which embraces you in Cuban Culture. It also brings you to places where Cuban Cigars are made, Cuban Food and a lesson on some historic Cuban sites. Looking forward to it!

Once this is done. I might stick around the neighbourhood to explore it a little more, but eventually, I need to get to the Downtown (I'll most likely walk) area as I've booked a Cruise from Sunset to darkness. This should last about an hour.

Once done, I'll explore downtown. I've noted that I should visit Over/Under, Mama Tried and The Lost Boy venues for a drink and some food. Thankfully these are located near to each other.

Once tired, it's an Uber/Lyft home.

# Day 3 - Wynwood, Biscayne Bay and Miami vs FSU in Hard Rock

Uber/Lyft again, this time to see the Wynwood walls. I booked a tour for about $15 and it takes about an hour. Looking forward to it! I had considered buying a ticket for the Buggy Tour, but it was $50, maybe it's worth it?

I'll then visit Gramps Bar for a bite to eat and a bottle of beer.

Walk to the Museum of Hip-Hop. I'm a big Hip-Hop fan, so getting to visit this should be great! I haven't bought a ticket yet, I think it's about $15. I'm also considering visiting the Museum of Graffiti. I'm undecided since the walls will already contain plenty of artwork.

Uber/Lyft to Biscayne Bay and visit Flannigans, which I know is a meme on this Subreddit. I think it's the Rib Rolls I have to try. Anyway, I'll watch the NCAAF games while I'm there as it's not too far from Hard Rock Stadium and have a beer or two.

Uber/Lyft to the stadium. I'm banking on this game being a late kickoff, but FSU doesn't look good at all, and the Miami Hurricanes do. I've a feeling it may be a 3:30 PM kickoff which means I'll have to alter my plans for the day entirely. My seat is at Midfield, in the nose bleeds, but close to the front of the section. It's the Hurricanes' sideline, so no sun issues regardless of kick-off time.

I was at the Georgia Tech and FSU game in Dublin, Ireland and purchased an FSU T-shirt. It's Irish branded and has the team's logo, will I be okay wearing this T-shirt or will it cause trouble? I'm hoping it'll be a conversation starter with people on the day. I'm looking forward to seeing the Miami team, the QB Cam Ward has impressed me over the past 2 weeks.

Once the game is done, I'll have to head back to the hotel. This might be an issue of traffic, but I have an early start on Sunday.

# Day 4 - Dolphins vs Cardinals in Hard Rock

It's an Uber/Lyft to the Miami Dolphins Tailgate near the stadium. A friend who lives there has kindly invited us along. This means I'll need to be there from around 10 AM to 10:30 AM.

Meet my buddies at the tailgate, enjoy it and enter the stadium for the game.

Here's the kicker, I'm on the side where the sun beams down. I read so much advice that I shouldn't do this, but I got a great offer on a seat at midfield so close to the field and I'm on the Cardinal sideline. Other options were in Row Z of the Dolphin sideline and cost more money. I am not sitting with my buddies, but that's okay.

After the game, the evening is wide open. I'm going to do whatever my friends want to do, which means probably going to Mid-Beach or South Beach to watch the evening games in a bar. This will be costly, but it's only one evening.

When it's home time, Uber/Lyft of course.

# Day 5 - South, Mid and North Beach, followed by Heat vs Pistons

When I decide to crawl out of bed with probably a hangover, I plan to visit the island. I plan to start from the bottom (South Pointe Park) and walk northwards for the day. Google Maps says this is doable in a few hours, but I have until 7 PM with pit stops here and there, so I'm in no hurry.

Maybe I'll rent a bike to explore South Pointe Park?

So, I've drawn up a list of sights I should see along the way on my walk, starting south and moving north, please see below:

1. South Pointe Park
2. Visit Ted's Hideaway
3. Miami Beach Boardwalk
4. Ocean Drive and Art Deco
5. Flamingo/Hummus
6. Mac's Club Deuce
7. Espanola Way
8. The Abbey Bar
9. Collins Avenue
10. Holocaust Memorial
11. Sunset Harbour (Maybe?)
12. Lost Weekend Bar (Maybe?)

Once that is all said and done, it's an Uber/Lyft to the Kaseya Arena for the Miami Heat and Detroit Pistons game. I'm sat pretty high up and far back, but hopefully I enjoy the game. Basketball is a sport I loved when I was younger, I even supported the Heat because Dwayne Wade was my favourite player, so it's a pleasure to get to see the team, live!

After that, it's home to bed.

# Day 6 - Advice Needed, No plans made as of yet

I'm considering either travelling to Fort Lauderdale or to the Miami Everglades, but honestly I am totally undecided. I'm open to any other suggestions from you locals, as well!

The Everglades was my original plan, but 2 people have told me it wasn't that good. I'd be doing the typical tourist thing - boat ride, a wildlife show etc.

Fort Lauderdale looks fabulous from the pictures I've seen online. I will have to travel there by train, though. When there, I think I'll do a cruise which lasts an hour or two.

# Day 7 - Hop on/Hop off Bus Tour, Airport and Home to Ireland

I've decided on going with the bus tour so I can take in the sights one final time and stop off at some places which I never got to see over the 6 days. I'm lucky that my bag will be stored away somewhere safe, so I won't need to worry about it until it's time to go to the airport.

My flight is at 10PM, so I have the entire day to see everything one final time.

# Other things I feel I should add

I've stumbled upon a list (Sorry, I've saved this post as a draft twice now) I curated with questions I'd like to ask locals. Please see below:

* What food should I get in Flannigan's? Rib Rolls or something else?
* I'm not a big beach guy, meaning I won't be going swimming. However, I will of course take a trip to the beach for the sights, to take photographs and all that.
* I wouldn't mind trying Argentinian food. Are there any good spots? I don't want to break the bank either, just try some Argentinian beef!
* Could someone recommend a good sports store? Basically, a big store which sells MLB, NHL, MLS and to a lesser extent NFL merchandise but not limited to Miami based teams... If such a place even exists!

I really can't think of what else to add right now. I just want to make sure I get this post to be right (Please don't delete AutoBot..). I'm not stressing about the trip or anything, I'm just looking to make sure I see/do as much as I can while there. If you've made it this far into the post, I sincerely thank you for reading and hopefully you have some feedback for me.

Looking forward to visiting!",1727630465.0,2024-10-08 10:34:22

I'll be in Tambopata for work for a week, and then we're meeting in Cusco and have a week together. We wanted to see Machu Picchu and Manu National Park (since I'll already have been in Tambopata region and he really wants to see the Amazon.)

Some folks from my work thing are booking a Cusco - MP - Cusco all in one day tour, but at $400 USD pp, it felt pretty steep to us. I'm hoping to put together a more budget-friendly plan.

Does it make sense to:

* Book ahead and take the 16:30 Bus + Train from Wanchaq to Aguascalientes (""Machu Picchu station"") on 9 November ($52pp)

* Book a ho(s)tel in AC for 9 Nov
* Try and find a guide in AC on the day, to take us up to MP on Circuit 2 on 10 November
* Book transit ahead and go back to Cusco on 10 November
* Book accommodation in Cusco for 10 November
* Try and find a tour, in Cusco, on 11 November to take us to Manu, likely leaving in the early AM 12 November and returning 15 November?

The last one is notable for being about $200 cheaper pp than most of the rest of them, which is great but also curious...

t3_1fsd0za,Transfer time for LAX,"Hello,

In a few months, I will be flying internationally for the first time. On December 28th, I will be flying out of SMF and into LAX with my brother via Southwest to transfer to terminal 7 and leave LAX on my international flight.

My SMF -&gt; LAX Flight is scheduled to be from 6:45AM to 8:20AM, to which then my second flight leaves at 11:30AM. These two flights are booked on separate tickets, and in every other connection I have more than enough time to transfer without any worry (the LAX to SMF return flight has a 6+ hour layover).

I'm aware that the terminal I would be arriving in LAX at, Southwest, is at the opposite side of where the United terminal lies, and that I additionally will need to collect and recheck baggage in my 3 hour window. Regardless, is this enough time to make it to my flight?

If I estimate that the flight is \~40 minutes delayed (meaning I am off the plane around 9AM), baggage collection takes \~30 minutes, and we take the \~15 minute walk outside of the airport to cross straight from Southwest to the United terminal (Both my brother and I are able to walk pretty quickly, there's no concern over exhaustion or anything), that would get us depositing luggage around 10AM (+15 minutes accounting for anything else). Then, we would have to get through security and be at the terminal within the remaining time.

I understand that this is a pretty optimistic timeline, and it should also be considered both that this will be early/late morning as well as extremely close to New Years where travel is likely going to be more frequent. With all that in mind, how risky is this decision? This is the earliest direct flight to LAX from SMF we could get.

t3_1fsnbn2,One of 6 people i have booked a flight for with Ryanair won't make it. Do i tell them somehow or is it enough to just not show up? Also how best to bring along medicine injections?,"Hello all,

Most my question is in the title. Essentially i am going on a trip with several family members in 2 weeks. We have booked the flight some time ago, but unfortunately one of my family has broken her leg recently and probably won't be able to come along with us.

I am not salty about the money and don't need a refund here. I just want to know for sure how best to proceed since i am worried we might be stuck waiting for a passenger who is not going to show up or something.

Also another question, if her leg does recover until our trip, she will still need to take some injections daily for another 6 or so weeks. She takes them herself. 

We have already spoken to our doctor about getting a note for them, but i don't know if they need to be in some sort of special packaging or if they have to be checked in or if they can be in cabin luggage etc...

Does anyone have some experiences or answers for me? Flight would be inside schengen area.

t3_jj0cli,American Food Made Me Sick When I Returned From Overseas,"Tl;dr After living abroad for many years I noticed when returning to America the food made me sick. Anyone with a similar experience? 

This happened to me twice over the course of 10 years. When I was 20 years old (2010) I moved to South Korea via orders from the US Army. The food there was definitely fresher. When you went out to eat food was freshly prepared. I felt healthier when I lived there. A large soda was like a 12oz cup. Portions were better controlled. I lived there for two years before returning to the US. When I came back I felt it in my gut immediately. Everything I ate would give me digestive issues. I’d frequent the Asian store to grab some foods I was familiar with and for the fresh kimchi. It took me months before I was use to some of the American food again. 

Flash forward to 2016, I received orders via the US army again, this time to Germany. I lived in Germany for three years. The food by far was some of the freshest I ever tasted. The milk especially. I’ve always loved milk, but after having German milk...I mean it’s the best. I had a local butcher in the village I lived in. They cut fresh meat daily, and a grocery store with fresh vegetables. I’m sure in larger cities there is more of an abundance of processed foods, but I lived in a smaller village. Anyways, I moved back to America in 2019. Ever since, everything makes me sick. I can taste like a chemical taste on some of the bread and meat products. This taste makes me not want to eat anything. I didn’t have it when I came back from South Korea. I’m not sure why now? It’s been a year since I’ve been back, and I don’t get as sick as I use to. I still get sick over the food though, and the taste thing is still prevalent. 

My question is: Has anyone had a similar experience to this?",1603802438.0,2024-10-08 10:34:22

t3_1fy6r62,"A week's long trip to Iceland, September 2024","For a while now I wanted to go to Iceland, and finally did it last month, and I have enjoyed it so much!

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much). 

The pictures, in order, are from: Seljalandsfoss, Solheimajokull *2, Vik, Reynisfjara beach, Selvallafoss, Northern Lights in a place close to Hvammsvik, Kirkjufell, Londrangar, Budakirkja, Gulfoss, Kerid Crater, Geysir, Reykjavik and Hvammsvik. ",1728305213.0,2024-10-08 10:34:42

I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience. I am a Ukrainian citizen with a residence permit in the EU.

Recently, while traveling, I accidentally spilled water on my biometric passport. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be heavily affected; the appearance and 99% of the stamps look just like before.

However, I’m concerned about the biometric NFC chip embedded in the passport’s cover. I wasn’t even aware of its existence before. Now that I’ve read about it, I found an app called ReadID and tried to scan the chip — but it’s not being detected :(

For instance, my friend’s passport scans without any issues.

My question is: how critical is this problem? Could it affect border crossings, opening bank accounts, or any other procedures where the passport is required? Does this make the passport invalid? Or is there a chance that official institutions have different devices that might be able to read the chip, even if my phone can’t?

Thank you very much in advance for your reply.

Yes: Catania is grittier and more “authentic” and I would say the food scene is better. And the night time is lit up and beautiful and eclectic. It’s fun, it’s the perfect base. But Taormina has charm, gorgeous views, lovely beaches. It’s not a hellhole.

t3_1fyfmr8,Trying to round out my Taiwan itinerary,"Hi all,

I've got a trip coming up to Taiwan at the end of this month for about 8 days. We'll be starting out in Taipei and planning to do a lot of the common activities and day trips from there (Yangmingshan, Beitou, biking around the city, night markets, Elephant and/or Teapot mountain hikes). 

We want to see another part of the country as well and have landed on Tainan. Currently we're booked for 3 nights there (arrive afternoon day 1, two full days, leave early back to Taipei on day 3). 

I've read that Tainan is all about history and food, and personally I'm not too much into the history when I travel. I'm not disinterested, but I'm not the type of person to prioritize museums or temples just for the educational aspect. I'm more intersted in nature/scenery, food, walking/biking around, local culture. It's very hard to tell if two full days in Tainan is going to be overkill for this and if we should prioritize Taipei time. 

Also we were considering the east coast but spending 5 hours to and from Taitung seemed like a lot of time after the rest of our travel (we'll be in Singapore coming from US first, so a lot of time on planes and traveling). Though biking around that area seems really nice. 

Just trying to find a good way to round out our trip and a bit worried Tainan might be a miss. It seems very polarizing in that many people recommend but then many people say it's boring. For someone like me that wouldn't normally prioritize museums/historical education, is there still enough to fill 2 days that wouldn't be better spent elsewhere?

t3_1fy2dpd,The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

Edit: added an image showing the label on the hotel’s page.

BOA airlines sucks and is very corrupt (not surprising to anyone who knows Bolivia well). With Bolivia's recent currency volatility, things have gotten a lot worse. Not a lot of options around Bolivia, unfortunately. 

  
**IF FLYING BOA:** 

1. Do not let the airline put priority tags on your luggage (if you are paying for an upgraded seat). All this will do is make your bag a target to be stolen / ransacked when checked 

2. Keep everything valuable with you... Particularly cash (should be obvious but i'll state the obvious)

3. If you are checking a bag, don't lock your luggage. Airline workers will just cut the locks off and ruin your suitcase. Might as well let them search through your things without breaking your suitcase so you don't have to spend a few hundred replacing the luggage they ripped into. BOA will not take any accountability for their employees breaking into your luggage and stealing your belongings.

  
This is not to say Bolivia is not a great country worth visiting. Just note that with the recent currency volatility, things have gotten worse so be extra careful. ",1728315390.0,2024-10-08 10:34:42

Sichuan, Tibet, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhangjiajie have huge draws.

I’m looking for an easy family resort with meals and activities included so it’s very low planning for me. But something fun for the teenagers too. 

Whenever I ask about all inclusive resorts, most people think of going to an island.  I’m looking for something easy and drivable from the Philly area -  Catskills, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia, etc. We do go to Woodloch Pines in the Poconos every year, just looking to mix it up with something different. 

I also want to make sure the teenagers are occupied. A lot of family resorts are geared towards little kids so I want to make sure there is enough for teenagers to do. My husband and I are easy, we just want to relax. I want to avoid getting on a plane (I travel a lot for work) and not worry about anything. 

Would love any and all suggestions.

t3_1fyghkm,Which places in South-East Asia is enjoyable in January?,"Me and my boyfriend are planning on taking a vacation in January to somewhere warm, and would love some advice/ insight/ suggestions! We live in Scandinavia so the days in winter are long, dark and cold, especially January. We´re both prone to winter depression, so now that we have the opportunity for a vacation in January, we´re planning on taking it. Indonesia has been an option we have been considering, and we wouldmlove to go there, but it seems as though the rain season is at it´s peak in January in parts of Indonesia. Though the rain itself doesn´t bother us that much, the high humidity does.

For context we would love to stay somewhere that´s not super mainstream or full of resorts. If we find a nice area, we´ll look into the opportunity of renting a nice little place for a couple weeks, somewhere by the coast, somewhere quiet. Preferably not around the biggest cities, but located near a village or something along those lines. We love good food but our budget doesn´t allow us fine dining, but that´s not a problem, somewhere with good local food is more than enough! We would love to stay somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture! We also love to surf and swim (we´re both beginners at surfing though) , but having that oppurtunity is also a big part of the vacation.

To summarize; we would love advice / suggestions on somewhere to go on vacation in south-east Asia that´s not to touristic and not too overflooded with rain and high humidity in January. Preferably somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture, where it´s possible to surf. Any suggestions or general advice is very appreciated! Thank you!!

My first purely personal (i.e. not for business) trip internationally.
I loved every single minute of it. From the food to the people, I couldn't make a single complaint. 
There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").

t3_1fyfn9k,South America 6 weeks travel itinerary,"Hello Reddit travelers!

We are a couple from Sweden, 30 and 27 years old, planning a 6-week trip through South America starting in January 2024. We’ve already booked our arrival and departure flights, landing in Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd of January and flying home from San José, Costa Rica, on the 18th of February. We love  to explore both cities and nature, but prefer to keep things fairly comfortable, avoiding long hikes and multi-day camping trips. We’ll mostly be flying between countries to save time and exploring various destinations without overloading our schedule. We're looking to stay in private rooms at hostels to stay on budget, but might consider hotels for a few nights in total if they're worth the extra buck. 

We have a route in mind and would love any feedback, especially tips on the must-sees, hidden gems, and general advice on logistics!
 

**--- January 3–13 (10 days) – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

We’re thinking about staying in the Ipanema area, close to Copacabana.
Planning to explore iconic spots like Sugarloaf Mountain, Selarón Steps, Parque Lage, and the beaches of course.
We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe).
Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out.
For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.   


 We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in?
We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?  


 **--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.**

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants.
Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.


**--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco)  – Fly to Cusco, Peru.**

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?  

  
**--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).**

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing?
Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.


**--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.**

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.


**--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.**

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example.
We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? 
We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?


**--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.**

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic.
Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

We’re aiming for a balance between adventure and relaxation while being budget-conscious. Also, if anyone has hostel recommendations with private rooms, please let us know! Thanks in advance!",1728327753.0,2024-10-08 10:34:42

It's not supposed to hit Miami as of right now but that could change. Also Friday is like 2 days after the estimated landfall that's going to be on Wednesday and it should've dissipated by then but I don't know how much.

What worries me is that if the area surrounding the airport floods then they're probably going to close that airport. 

It's very important that I get to Chicago on Friday so I can't move the trip to next week. 

It's going to be me and my wife but we're in separate reservations. Hers is paid with cash and has a strict cancellation policy and mine was with miles and has a flexible cancelation policy. 

I have the option of flying through Houston instead, which will give me a little peace of mind but we would be forfeiting her ticket and losing that money. The thing is that I should make the decision today, bc the price is still kinda reasonable. 

So my options would be, waiting it out and leaving everything as is, but risk my trip getting upended by the hurricane, or losing my wife's ticket money and just changing my ticket and buying a new one for her (but risking that Miami would be unscathed and I spent all that money for nothing)

So I'm wondering: Can I simply rely on the cabs? I understand it can be an expensive option, but I’m willing to spend some money. Do cabs go everywhere? Is there a hotel that’s closer to the main attractions?

Thank you so much for your help.

t3_1fy7h65,Travel suggestions for Nov and Dec on east coast,"Hi everyone,

My family is visiting from overseas in mid-November and will stay until Jan beginning. They live in a tropical country, so they've never experienced fall colors or snowy winters before. I live on the East Coast, and I'd love for them to experience as many things as possible. I'm planning weekend trips mostly so they can rest during the week (I have work, and my parents are in their 60s, so I don't want to overwhelm them).

Here's what I have in mind:

1. **Fall foliage:** Do any states still have fall foliage left by the 3rd week of November? I was thinking of taking them to DC, but I’m open to suggestions.
2. **Niagara Falls:** Is it worth visiting during late November/Thanksgiving weekend? How is the experience around that time?
3. **New York City:** Planning an overnight stay around Christmas/New Year and going to see the Statue of Liberty the next day. Which one would be better
4. 3-4 days trip to California to get them some sun and just relax on the beach.

If anyone has other recommendations, I’d love to hear them. I'm looking for ideas that would be easy on them  but still let them enjoy the best of what this season has to offer.

t3_1fya1r4,Hertz is trying to charge me for damage to the car pls give me advice ,"We returned the car with no damages and the agent that checked our car verbally stated that there were no damages. The gas lid that is on the outside of the car with the paint fell off on the first refueling of the car when I tried to open it by pushing and it just came off with my hand. It was completely undamaged at return and the agent said it was no problem and he tried to reattach it himself but there was a crunch sound and he snapped something. He then said that he would have to send it to the shop so they can re attach it and reassured me that there would be no charges whatsoever. Once again if you note the areas of damage in the report there is nothing that says damage just assessment to the gas lid which in the picture is right next to it. If the gas lid was damaged it was done by the agent. 

I never received an email about the damages and deleted any pictures and videos I had about the car to save storage on my phone. I only received a letter which I didn’t see until I returned from travels. It is wrong that I was not sent an email as soon as this was billed and only got a physical mail that I didn’t see for another month. 

there has to be security camera footage of my return date at the time that I signed the document showing that I explained it to the agent and that he himself tried to reattach it and damaged it right? He was reassuring me that no fees would be charged and no damage was done and that they just needed to reattach it.

t3_1fyj80o,Can KLM really trick me into giving them EUR 980,"
All my life I’ve been dreaming of going to Rio de Janeiro. I booked a flight to celebrate finishing my master’s degree. I had to work while studying to afford this trip. I booked a basic fare (EUR 980) by accident and asked customer service if I could upgrade to a student fare (for an extra EUR 110). They told me it was okay. The student fare brings several benefits such as checked-in luggage but most importantly, flexibility. You can reschedule for free and get a refund for EUR 250. So I upgraded. When upgrading I specifically asked if I could get all the benefits from the student ticket. Yes, they said, I specifically asked if I could reschedule for free and if I can reschedule for free and get a refund for the TOTAL price minus the EUR 250 cancellation fee. The lady said yes.

To keep a long story short, my last exam didn’t go as planned and I don’t really know when exactly I can go (this is out of my control). So instead of rebooking the flight for free I decided it’s worth losing the cancellation fee of EUR 250 from my total EUR 1090 and rebook by myself afterwards somewhere in mid-February to mid-March since I didn’t know exactly when I would be able to go.

The issue: I got back EUR 110 and nothing else. I explained to customer support that I was informed the opposite and they simply don’t care. Since I did the upgrade and asked about the cancellation through phone, I expect their guidance and given word to be correct. What can I do?

t3_1fy4rhm,Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

I’ve even seen next-day flights drop in price significantly, which is super frustrating because I’m torn—do I grab something “reasonable” now, only to watch it fall by $200 a week later? Should I wait? Am I just doomed to stress-refreshing flight deals?

I vaguely remember some airlines offering price protection, but I can’t recall which ones (or if that’s even still a thing). Maybe third-party sites like Orbitz offer this? Though, my last experience trying to make a claim with one of those price guarantees felt like battling customer service bosses in an endless loop of “please hold.”

So, what’s the best strategy for dealing with these wildly fluctuating fares? And is there any legit price protection out there? Would love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT:**  I just booked a fare and didn't realize that United now has this ""fare lock"" feature where you can lock the fare for - in this case - 3 days - and then opt to buy or not.

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip.

Also, I must clarify that I was referring to a time that is WELL before landing, that is before the pilot announces “cabin crew prepare for landing”. I’m aware that they can’t help you after. 

Also, we don’t pay for water here :)

For the last 4 days... December 26-29.. I am contemplating flying to Salta to explore. This would give me  2-1/2 to 3 days there.. leaving out flying time. 

The tour itself will go to the parana' delta area , rocoleta cemetery area, explore one or two neighborhoods in Buenosaires and gives us about half a day that is unstructured and on our own. This doesnt seem like much time to see the city. before we the fly off to Patagonia.   

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool. In the later option I would probably lose a day due to flying.. (the flight is only 2 hours, but to get to airport and out of airport twice etc.. will shoot most of a day.

Without getting too far into it, my daughter is fed through a feeding tube connected to her stomach. She has to be connected to her pump for 20 hours a day. I understand her pump and medications can be carried on or even checked for free due to them being medical devices. 


One other challenge is she requires special formula we can’t buy at grocery stores and will need to bring a complete supply with us. Can this be considered medical or will we have to check a bag full of formula? 

I have a CPAP machine as well, could we have one large “medical bag”? 

What’s the best way to get through TSA?


This is our first big trip in years and we are trying to be prepared as possible. 

Any advice or suggestions will be greatly welcome.",1728220335.0,2024-10-08 10:34:44

t3_1fy0s0c,Need advice on my Vietnam itinerary,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are planning a trip to Vietnam from January 30th to February 10th next year. We’ve already booked our tickets, which were a great deal, but I overlooked the fact that our trip coincides with the Tet celebrations. We’re feeling a bit anxious about how the first few days might go, so we’d love some feedback from anyone with more experience in Vietnam during this time.

Here’s our itinerary:

* **January 30:** Arrive at Hanoi airport, then take a private transfer to Tam Coc, Ninh Binh. We should arrive by 4 PM, so we’ll keep it low-key—grab a meal, walk around, and acclimatize after the flight.
* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

We’re wondering if we’ll be able to arrange private transfers during Tet and whether the weather will be warm enough to enjoy the beaches in Da Nang and Hoi An at that time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1728280543.0,2024-10-08 10:34:44

t3_1fy6p82,Krakow Travel Report,"**Arrival:**

My visit to Kraków took place on an overcast few days in early October 2024. I'd set aside three days for the city and a day trip to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. The appeal was the affordability of the trip and a curiosity to visit a Polish city and learn more about Polish culture, the WW2 history at Auschwitz-Birkenau (the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers) was also a factor in the decision to go. Many Poles choose to come to work and live in my country of residence; and I reciprocally desired to gain an understanding of their cultural background.

Alighting at the train station and walking past Barbakan (est. 1498) and through St. Florian's Gate (c. 1307) was an impressive entrance to the city. It was about 10pm at this point and as we walked down Floriańska (St. Florian's Street), I quickly noticed a number of dolled up young women standing in the middle of the street holding black umbrellas in the light rainy drizzle, looking around at bypassers. Was this prostitution or something else? Not the best first impression, but I am aware that soliciting for prostitution is legal in Poland and their laws on the matter are more lax. Sadly, in my opinion this does colour public spaces with a sleazy vibe, I think such activities should be kept out of sight especially in such a thoroughfare not far from the main square. Even at night. I did not notice any police presence monitoring these apparent activities.

**Day 1:**

Fast forward to the next day and we started by walking through part of the charming ‘Planty park’ (a circular park which encompasses the entire Old Town district), noticing an amusing overabundance of park benches. Unfortunately there were no big central parks or highly curated green areas besides this. We then hauled ourselves up a gradual slope to ascend Wawel Hill to the castle and cathedral. This is considered the most culturally important site in Poland. After having a quick stroll around the imposing Italian-style castle courtyard, we chose to enter the (nearly 1,000 year-old) cathedral via the audio-guided tour, which was not too costly. Sadly the cathedral tower was heavily scaffolded which tarnished the view. The audioguide headsets conveniently triggered different audio clips as you walk around the site, which meant you didn't have to key in numbers. Wawel Cathedral is where Polish monarchs were formerly crowned and buried. The monarchy was abolished on 25th November 1795. It's a shame that the Polish monarchy has ended as I find national interest in its own intelligentsia and ruling class to be a showcase of heroism, statecraft, and political leadership through the centuries. Although I acknowledge the valid criticism of the notion of monarchy.

From the outside, the cluster of different architectural additions over the centuries is intriguing to see, particularly the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel (1533) which was beautiful and is considered the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps, dedicated to the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty. It's worth noting that the site was getting quite busy and numerous tour groups were congregating and piling through the cathedral. Because it was a relatively small cathedral, this crowding did feel slightly uncomfortable (but still manageable) at times. There were no photos permitted inside the cathedral. 

We ascended the steep steps of the Royal Sigismund Bell tower which led to the bell at the top and a slightly restricted view over the city through a wire barrier. There was a photo op to touch the bell's clapper, which is considered good luck. Once again it was quite busy in this space owing to the crowds, luckily there was a separate descent staircase available.

We then walked down Wawel Hill into the expansive 13th century town square (Rynek Główny), the so-called ‘biggest medieval square in Europe’ according to some sources, but Charles Square in Prague is actually two times larger FYI. Our first port of call was the free to enter Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) shopping arcade in the middle of the town square, many vendor outlets sold what looked like traditional Polish goods, in particular the amber goods typical of the region and many other figurines, souvenirs, and models. 

After this we entered the grand Brick Gothic St. Mary's Basilica which sadly had a cladding of scaffolding on the main tower due to longterm repairs, meaning ascending the tower was not possible. The interior was beautiful but it was a fairly brief experience after sitting down to soak up all the churchiness. Every hour a bugle player plays a traditional five-note bugle call (hejnał) from the basilica's tallest tower. They often wave down at the crowds below. We popped into the Muzeum Farmacji (Pharmacy Museum), it is a small museum which features a good collection of pharmacy paraphernalia, but I wasn't raving about it after a few rooms full of similar jars and pots. The information and presentation of the museum appeared to have been unchanged for many years.

Walking around Wawel Hill and the town itself, images of the Polish Pope, John Paul II (1920-2005) - born Karol Józef Wojtyła - can be seen in many places, some may even say excessively! I found it quite whimsical seeing so many portraits of JP2, even despite my reservations about the Catholic Church as an institution. You can sometimes see monks walking around the town on their daily commutes.

**Day 2:**

On our second day we hopped on a guided tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. The tour was well organised although the bus itself was fairly cramped. First we stopped at Auschwitz I (Stammlager), known as former administrative and operational centre of the death-camp, and we're given headsets to hear a crystal clear transmission of the guide's voice as we were taken around the site as part of the group tour. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was the more visually striking of the two sites, with the instantly recognisable gatehouse and train tracks. The Birkenau site was even bigger than I'd imagined. The barbed wire fences and guard towers tapered off into the distance, with the site covering 6,000 football pitches of space. Both sites put together were a moving warning about humanity's darkest capabilities, with well-selected and impactful exhibits. Although I could see no central dedicated museum building. We returned to Kraków, getting back at around 7pm before then going to ‘The Black Duck’ restaurant which was very good value and enjoyable (plus points for duck theming), it was hands down the culinary highlight of the trip. Walking back to our accommodation we were solicited by a prostitute, but politely turned down the offer.

**Summary:**

I found Poland quite dour. A number of the eateries we went to nearly all played melancholic music, many of the souvenir shops stock items with an intriguing tearful girl theme, combining this melancholia with a sudden rundown post-communist greyness (and countless graffitied walls) almost immediately outside of Kraków's Old Town district, the hyped up Kazimierz area is no exception to this. Alongside the city's proximity to a major former Nazi death-camp, the experience was somewhat overshadowed by these things. Of course, Poland cannot easily separate itself from this history under Soviet &amp; Nazi occupation and before that being partitioned three times (the Austrian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition) in the late 18th century leading to 123 years of no Polish sovereignty. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed. The identity and nation of the Poles has been under threat for centuries and I think this reflects in the locals' outlook and culture, they are a guarded people fiercely interested in their national identity and faith. This is a nation in the process of regaining its pride and sense of self. The creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, was only founded in 1989, making modern Poland only 35 years old. In 2022, Poland, Greece, and Cyprus had the highest percentage of adults in the EU at risk of depression, with a share of 65 percent. This is a country with many depressed and downhearted people, but Poland is certainly moving through a period of new beginnings.

Another thing to mention is the Cracovian road zebra crossings don't often have traffic lights. So there were a number of times I felt unsafe trusting motorists to spot me and stop to allow me to safely cross the road. With that being said there isn't a lot of traffic around Kraków and locals are encouraged to use the trams.

Tourist attractions around Kraków were okay, it's very church-heavy reflecting the Catholic way of life there. At times I felt the historical museums could have told Poland's national story more narratively and engagingly. I understand there was a golden age for Poland before the partitions and then occupations during the 20th century. This golden age roughly corresponds to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572).

However, I found the Cracovian museums to be more descriptive than narrative in tone, drily listing information rather than arranging it for a modern touristic palette. Because Poland's history is more on the niche side, I'd have hoped for a more comprehensive overview/retelling. The Rynek Underground Museum (under the town square) seemed like a tourist trap displaying a banal arrangement of rocks and pillars. I decided to avoid entry. The same can be said of the former town hall tower, the view is said to be extremely limited.

To justify a trip to Kraków I recommend spending about two days there max. You will enjoy great value for money on food and drink but the tourist sites are nothing out of this world. You should ideally combine the town with a day trip to either the salt mine or Auschwitz-Birkenau, or perhaps to the mountains nearby if you are outdoorsy (the Tatra Mountains and Zakopane, a popular resort town in the foothills of the mountains). I recommend taking in the town slowly, it shouldn't be rushed as you may quickly run out of things to do if you are not careful.

I give Kraków an overall 5.5/10.

**Souvenirs:**

I struggled to find many souvenirs/keepsakes that really caught my eye. I would recommend having a look in the Kraków Cloth Hall and the outlets on the outside of the building, although I felt much of the items for sale were almost identical between the stalls, the variety on offer was unfortunately lacking. 
I recommend checking out Niebieska Kropka Boleslawiec Pottery and the ""Kacper Ryx"" Historical Shop. I purchased a handmade fridge magnet from the latter which was fairly pricey, but had rustic appeal. I also stumbled across the Wawel Castle Souvenir shop (to the left of the courtyard entrance as you enter) and it turned out to be one of the better souvenir shops in Kraków. So do check that out.

**Food:**

None of my travel review should be considered exhaustive, but I highly recommend going to Czarna Kaczka/ Black Duck for authentic Polish cuisine. Try the Borscht (beetroot soup), it's very tasty. Also make sure you have pierogi somewhere during your visit. For breakfast I heartily recommend Milkbar Tomasza and the savoury pancake with spinach and cheese filling.",1728305046.0,2024-10-08 10:34:44
t3_1fxrmv5,sabbatical travel from Canada,"So next year I'm on sabbatical. When I say next year, I basically mean September 2025 to June 2026 (I'm a teacher...that's a year for me with summer being a bonus!lol)

I'm hoping to travel as much as my money will allow. We live in Montreal. My son is off one week in November and one week in April (Easter) so I'm looking for a destination with him. He will be 15 and obsessed with Disney. We have already been to the Florida and California ones. He wants to be an imagineer when he's older. Some ideas: Paris with Disneyland, a Disney cruise from Florida, Greece (he's also into mythology and Percy Jackson). He's not a picky eater which is good for traveling and loves museums. 

My daughter will have the first three weeks of January off. She will be 18 and is very easy going. Not really into museums. She wants to learn how to surf and is super into Asian culture (but Japan is a no no which will be explained later). I was thinking Vietnam, Costa Rica, a cruise, New Zealand, a cruise, etc. We can also do a group thing (Intrepid or G adventures). She will not travel somewhere where she needs an extra vaccine! lol!

At some point during my break I'm planning on going to Japan with my husband. Just the two of us. We aren't sure when, probably October or early March (before blossoms). I think we should add South Korea since it's close.

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I am not bound to specific vacation times like when I'm teaching. Usually I can only travel during the summer (which is too bad since we have great weather here and have a pool we like to enjoy), Christmas or March break.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

Social: As a first time solo backpacker, I was wondering about meeting other backpackers and the social scene. I know hostels have event but they’re usually a miss than a hit. Anyone have tips? What should I expect/my mentality be going into this? I’ve always wanted to get to know with other people and idk if there are social circles for that.

Transit: How do you get around? Do I bring cash? Is there an app? Pay in person? i.e. Going to Nice, France and wanted to travel to sites a few hours away. Same with Milan and other places.

Weather: I realized the weather forecast is pretty rainy and colder. Clothing recs?

t3_1fxp2jj,Recommendations for a beach.,"Wondering if anyone has some ideas for places for my friends and I to get together for a beach week that's (relatively) easy to fly to from Dublin, Boston, &amp; NYC (We're a spread-out friend group)?  The challenge is that we're forced to do it during Christman &amp; New Year's (I know, I know) because of scheduling. From what I can tell, we'll be paying 4x the amount, which sucks, but it's the only thing that can work.  So, if there's a way to balance keeping costs down wherever we can vs. might as well enjoy it since we're gonna pay too much, I'm all ears.  
The places that seem geographically viable are the Canary Islands, Various spots in the Carribean, or the south of Spain, but we're open to any suggestions within these places or beyond them.  Would appreciate any advice.

However, the moment he entered our American info, the price shot up by 500%.

t3_1fxnfc4,How to setup a trip through the Pacific Northwest in August with a toddler,"We are a couple with a 3 year old kid and I’m in charge of suggesting an itinerary for a trip next August. 

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

t3_1fxk2d5,13 Day Itinerary Check - Switzerland,"Hello! I tend to be an overly type A, ambitious person when it comes to traveling because I want to see everything I possibly can. I also love planning and making itineraries.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

We're aiming for mid-late May 2025. Thank you in advance!

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast.

t3_1fxgsrz,Should I tweak my New Zealand Itinerary to add 1 night in Hawke's Bay?,"I am planning a return trip to New Zealand's North Island after doing a 2 week trip to the South Island last year. I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

I’m looking for travel recommendations, considering I’m based in Mexico and earn in Mexican pesos (MXN). I’ll be traveling with my partner, so we’re particularly interested in destinations that offer a great balance between affordability and amazing experiences. Our budget isn’t huge, so we’re hoping to find places where the cost of living, food, and activities won’t break the bank but still allow us to enjoy what we love.

Some preferences:

	•	We both love beach destinations and sporting events/places.
	•	Open to both domestic (Mexico) and international destinations.
	•	We enjoy outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and trying local food.
	•	Safety is also an important factor.

t3_1fxdr8n,2+ weeks in Guatemala and Belize,"Hi,

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

What doesn't make sense to me is the trip from Atitlan to Flores as it's a 10-12 hours journey. But then it makes sense to get from Flores to Belize.

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

Would you amend the time spend in any of the placea above? I hear mixed opinions about Semuc Champey so skipped it as it's a long journey.

t3_1fxgmu1,Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

My family is looking at going to Peru to hike the Inca Trail this December around Christmas. I’m super pumped, I’ve always wanted to do this, so I have no objections. However, I’ve been thinking about the logistics, and am feeling a little bit hesitant now.

I am very concerned that I will lose weight during the hike.

t3_1fxbat3,Cairns/Port Douglas vs. Auckland for last big trip from Australia,"My partner and I have lived in Australia a few years and are currently in Hobart. We plan to move back to North America in the next year and are deciding between two options for our final big (expensive) trip - The Great Barrier Reef or New Zealand. 

Due to timing and cost, we can only spend a week, so we’d be limited to just one of the islands in NZ. Timing is in the next two months, which I know isn’t great as we get into rainy season for QLD, but that’s what works for our schedules. I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. ",1728200554.0,2024-10-08 10:34:45

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her. We’ve both been Booking members for almost the exact same amount of time, booked about the same amount (we go back and forth each trip), and are both at the same Genius level as well as the same amount of bookings away from reaching the next level.

What is going on here? I understand d A/B testing or selectively offering different locations and devices certain rates, but we are, for the most part, going into the searches with the exact same parameters.

Both on iPhones, same IP, same Genius level, about the same past spending.

And yet, she’s getting minor to massive discounts every time and I’m stuck more or less just paying the normal rate…

I obviously don’t want to pay, because blood stains can be washed and the sheets already had some stains (small but still) and I think the price is insane. It’s also not specified anywhere in the room the cost of any of the items if they were to replace them.

My strategy is to go tell them I’m not gonna pay for stains that can be washed and definitely not that much. The main issue is I have my passeport as deposit (I know stupid) so probably I’ll have to pay hopefully I can negotiate.

Please help me, what would you do in this situation? I’m so annoyed",1728217030.0,2024-10-08 10:34:45
t3_1fxl3yr,Cairo really doesn't deserve the bad reputation.... ,"As the title says

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

t3_1fx8f8a,"Last months of our trip, Nepal or more SEA ?","Hey travelers,

my girlfriend and I are in the last month of our one year world trip and have a hard decision to make.

So far we travelled Argentina/Bolivia/Peru/Chile/Columbia/Mexiko/Japan/South Korea and now are in Laos. Our original plan was to go to north Vietnam (Ha Giang Loop) after Laos and then fly to India for a month and afterwards to the Philippines in December cause we gonna met some friends there.

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

So its basically 

Vietnam/India/Philippines/New Zealand 

vs 

Nepal/India/Philippines/Vietnam or New Zealand

I know this is really about personal preferences but still we would be happy for some input from other travelers. Both North Vietnam and Nepal were affected by the current floods so we are quite unsure about that also. Is is even possible to do the three passes trek that spontaneous ? Also we are travelling with hand luggage and would have to buy/rent a lot of stuff in Nepal.

Thanks !

t3_1fxblxi,How is this Switzerland itinerary for Jan?,"Me and my family will be in Lyon over January and we want to spend a week in Switzerland. It'll be me + partner and 2 kids (6 and 10).

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)",1728201948.0,2024-10-08 10:34:45
t3_1fwkv4m, Magic in Macedonia,"Macedonia took us by surprise. It’s not the first place people think of when they plan a Balkan trip, but man, it should be. We drove through Skopje, with its mix of old-world charm and modern quirks, and ended up camping by Lake Ohrid. The stillness of the lake, surrounded by mountains, had this calming effect—like you were in a different world.

One night, we met a group of Macedonian travelers who invited us to a small village festival. There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them. We nursed the van back to the nearest town, with every downhill stretch feeling like a gamble. A quick fix at another local garage got us going again, but it was a reminder that this adventure came with real risks.",1728112764.0,2024-10-08 10:34:45

I'm planning a trip to Europe for May of next year, where I will be traveling with my parents and sister for about 14 days. The current very rough outline is to fly into Prague, spending several days there and possibly adding day trips to Kutna Hora or other nearby towns. We would then make our way to Munich where we would also spend several days. We would end our trip in Switzerland, spending about a week there before flying out from Zurich. My questions are:

Are 14 days a viable amount of time for this plan?

Would it make more sense to rent a car or travel exclusively by train?

Are there any places along this general route that you would recommend visiting?

Where would you advise staying overnight or spending a day in Switzerland?

Our interests include sites with historical value such as old city centers, castles, etc, as well as museums and architecture. We also look forward to trying some good local beer and experiencing nature. I am looking into all of this myself of course, but I have seen some great advice for various trips in this sub and would love to hear what you all think! Thank you in advance.

In retirement planning, my wife and I want to continue to travel, but I have had recent realizations making me really think of how to do that once we're retired. We live in the USA.

Like if I'm 70 and had a heart attack, do you just screw yourself for the rest of your retirement? My current insurance provides health care abroad, but I'd hate to work to my death just for the health care. I'd also hate to not travel just for the chance I might have an ER visit. Do you just buy travel insurance for the trip to cover that? I've seen things like Faye but then I also read that they can be a pain to deal with and not pay out. thanks for any insight you all can provide.

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport? Also does anyone know Denver airport well? Would we have to switch terminals in order to get to the domestic departures gate from the international arrivals gate?

Thinking we could do something like this...

Option 1:
- Arrive in Barcelona on 19 September - 6 nights 
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 1 night (breaking up the N to S journey)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 3 nights
- Fly home (13 October)

OR

Option 2:
- Arrive in Madrid on 11 September - 1 night to settle in
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 3 nights 
- Barcelona - 6 nights (quicker trip same day rather than having to arrive the night before directly from San Sebastian and lose a night there)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 1 night
- Fly home (6 October)

All domestic travel by train. 

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1.

Friday:

Friday night we are driving to holland in the evening to stay with a family member. We are considering trying sleeping bear dunes on the way down there since it’s in route from Mackinac to holland. We’ve also considered doing a second day exploring Mackinac island on Friday instead. Is it worth it to do two days in Mackinac or should we make the trip to sleeping bear dunes?

We’re tight on time, and trying to find a balance between seeing everything we really want to see and making sure we’re not constantly driving and rushing around. If we were to add a day, should we spend more time at pictured rocks, spend more time on Mackinac island, or try tahquamenon falls?

t3_1fw3r80,Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else.

t3_1fx4okn,Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues. Orbitz doesn't even need to admit any error. But they do need to fix it.

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right?

Just thought I'd throw it out there now and see if anyone has experienced this before:

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both? Just trying to see how to maximize my claims approval since I'm double covered..so why not?

Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot.

I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. ",1728094584.0,2024-10-08 10:34:45

t3_1fwj8tm,Collecting checked bag in Frankfurt and checking it for a separate flight 2 hrs later. Tips?,"I had to check my bag from Athens to Frankfurt (on Aegean). I need to check it again for Frankfurt to Seattle (on Condor) 2+ hours later. I asked in Athens and it was not possible for them to check it through. 

I thought it might be worth asking here for any tips to make that go as smoothly as possible.

I am non Schengen. I assume that I must stand in line and go through customs to do this, as if I am leaving the airport. I’ll collect at bag claim, then queue again at bag drop for Condor, and again to go back through security. Am I missing anything, and is there anything you can share that might make this go more smoothly? Is bag claim for Aegean very far from bag drop for Condor?

Should a couple of hours for this be enough? I’m a little nervous because before this trip I hadn’t checked a bag in 25 years, and in Athens I had to wait 45 minutes in a sauna for my bag to come out. I remember why it’s best to not check bags.",1728105824.0,2024-10-08 10:34:45

t3_1fwibd5,Planning a trip for March 2025 for up to two weeks; Suggested destinations?,"Title. I reside in Seattle, WA

March 2025 is when I'll be done with my grad school program, and as a reward I want to go on a solo travel for up to two weeks. I have several destinations that I have in mind and things I want to do there, and wanted to get estimates on how long it would take me for the stuff I want to do plus anything else you guys might suggest. I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum
* The Scottish highlands, Wales, the Lake District, Cornwall, the Cotswolds

**4. Japan (1.5 weeks?)**

Similiar to UK, I wanted to stay in Toyko initially, But I feel there's so much to explore in Japan. Really want to fit in time to visit an onsen at least for two days, and do stuff between Toyko and Osaka? Full list of things I want to do:

* Eat tons of sushi, ramen, curry, tempura bowls, and even a fugu sashimi
* Visit to Studio Ghibli Museum
* Visit to Tokyo tower
* Shibuya
* Onsen Trip, as I mentioned
* Shopping for some tax-free items cheaper compare to US; Maybe a Gundam Figure build kit or a Gibson Guitar?",1728102282.0,2024-10-08 10:34:45

I’ve had a look at these places and have listed out the particular ones that I would like to visit.

In Bali, I find Gili T, Nusa Penida, Ubud and Uluwatu nice but considering I’m only going for a week I would probably leave Gili T and Nusa Penida out. I am considering Bali but it honestly is my last option as how touristy it is kind of turns me off.

In Vietnam, I would really like to visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Hoi an. I am not sure if this is too many places for one week. Phu quoc is also on the list but I’ve heard it is a tourist trap (?)

Thailand. I haven’t really looked at a particular place in Thailand yet but I am considering visiting Thailand as it would be the “best” time to visit.

Disclaimer: Maybe this should be for r/ AskA""Nearly""Canadian, but I couldn’t find that particular group! Askacanadian moderated it out and the immigration reddits dont seem to cover it , so apologies for posting something oddly specific in r/travel 

I’m looking to book a sunny getaway this winter for my partner and me from Canada. I noticed there are several countries that a Canadian Permanent Resident can visit with their PR card and passport, even if the passport isn’t super powerful.

Has anyone traveled from Canada to any of these places (with PR card in hand + their *weak* national passport)? Are some more relaxed than others? Any tips or things to avoid (besides the usual travel advice)? I know I need to do more research once we decide, but I’m hoping for some personal experiences with immigration etc., like *how you fared with your all-inclusive trip to Cancun with Transat* or something(definitely avoiding USA stopovers!).

It was never an issue for me with my strong European passport, but I gather it might be trickier for someone with a weaker one like my better half. I just want to understand all the angles before getting her hopes up!

Seemed legitimate but due to being impacted by hurricane Helene, I couldn’t provide the confirmation code due to no service or WiFi (called via landline). They gave me a different number and gave me a 50% refund.

This week I had signal and wanted to see if I could get the other 50% as it would be helpful considering the hurricanes impact on us. Called the number above and they worked to see what they could do. They offered me credits for the other half and told me that it would be a $99 service fee for this since it was a manual refund. 

I believe I started to be scammed here.

I gave them my credit card info (I don’t think I should have done this looking back), and they sent me an email from: reservations@thebookingconfirmation.com. It was a receipt and information but it looks shady. The charge on my credit card also shows as: airtktservices(followed by a number). 

What really made me think I just got scammed is they said I would have to call a specific number in order to use the credits: +1-844-202-1445.

My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi. But if I stay in Vleteren, I'll be able to walk there and back, depending on the distance between the hotel and In De Vrede. What do you think is the best way to proceed here?
2. The following day, Tuesday, I'm going to Florenville to visit Orval, in a journey over 5 hours.  So, would you advise me to leave from Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper, Vleteren or whatever?

If you have any tips on beer stores or beers you like to drink that I could buy, I'd be grateful.  
And I hope you can help me clear up my doubts about my itinerary and help me plan my trip.",1728067678.0,2024-10-08 10:34:46

This specific flight is in partnership with Japan Airline and is operated by JAL as well. 

I recently received an email from both AA and JAL saying my flight was changed. In the JAL email, they proposed to have my flight destination changed to HND instead, which would be great for me. I went through their process and booked the new flight. 

However this new flight is NOT in partnership with AA. At the confirmation page, I receive the following message (screenshot). When I check in my AA app, I see both flights been included (where the JAL flight doesn’t have a corresponding AA flight number)

Want to ask: 1) is it possible to pay for an AA flight and make a change to a JAL flight not in partnership with AA? 2) what’s the right next step here? Worst case scenario would be to have my original flight canceled and the new flight not go through.

Good Nature

Cultural scene

budget friendly

Not too difficult to fly back to the USA from.

French Riviera (although that may be too expensive - honestly not sure as I haven't looked too deeply at prices for that area)

Spain - Madrid

Greece

t3_1fvzqax,China in July - 15 days itinerary question,"Hello everyone!

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

Thanks in advance!",1728050084.0,2024-10-08 10:34:46
t3_1fw509b,Morocco 9-day itinerary tips,"Hi everyone! Me and my partner are going to Morocco for a 9-day trip in November (including travel days), it's our first time there and I would like some tips! It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

  
And if you have any other tips about Morocco and traveling there, please let me know :) ",1728063497.0,2024-10-08 10:34:46

Osaka to Shanghai Pudong = Peach Aviation (arriving 24:20)

Shanghai Pudong to Bangkok = Thai Lion Air (departing 02:40)

Luggage: HAND CARRY ONLY!

Layover time: 2 hours 20 mins

- Since we don't have any check in luggage, is it possible to just go to the transfer desk and get a boarding pass there? (Note: Thai Lion Air doesn't allow online check in for international flights according to their website)

- If not, do we have to apply for a transit visa just so we can go through immigration and customs and then check in again at the Thai Lion Air counter?

- OR can we just go straight to immigration and customs and they will issue us a transit visa there considering we are not leaving the airport and only getting out of airside so we can check in again?

We are either considering the Amazon or Lake titicaca. We've obviously never been to the Amazon, but have been to El yunque in Puerto Rico. If rainforest is rainforest than we might go to titicaca.

t3_1fwax5k,My experience traveling internationally with a drone for the first time.,"I recently (September 2024) traveled to Greece with my new DJI Mini 3 with a short layover in Istanbul, both on the way there and back. I flew on Turkish Airlines. This was not my first time traveling internationally, but it was the first time with that type of equipment and I was utterly stressed out about it. I purchased the drone specifically for said trip. I made the mistake of going down a Reddit rabbit hole and all it did was make me feel more uneasy about it to the extent that I was ready to leave the drone behind. I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone. I even went through the painstaking process of registering the drone in Greece and I felt even that was a complete waste of my time. Just thought I would share my experience.

I want to take my time while also seeing as many cool things as I can before I fly back to the my side of the globe.

  
I've got some ideas of what I want to see: definitely spend time exploring London and Berlin, stop off somewhere in the Netherlands, look into stopping off in Scotland or France (but I bet it will be very cold and dark in Scotland!). I'm super interested in the history and the culture, so looking for museums and old architecture, and anything else that will be a fun memory.

  
So my big questions are:

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

t3_1fvrfir,Urgent: Bulgarian airlines Lost Luggage Tag,"Hey!

I went on a work related trip to Sofia (Bulgaria) and I flew home to Lisbon (Portugal) two days ago. After arriving in Lisbon, I wasn’t able to find my bag and realized it had been lost.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice.

t3_1fvj3pm,Renting a car in the US as a Canadian and I have some questions.,"I am flying to Vegas next week where I have a whole 12 day trip planned out with my girlfriend. My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out.

Hey, looking to get my hubs luggage for an Xmas gift for an international trip i am planning. We have never bought rolling/360 spinner luggage before and I'm wondering for international flights would a checked roller or a carry on roller make more sense? Our gift $ limit makes it where i might not be able to find a 2 piece set... so im asking if you could ONLY choose ONE what makes the most sense? (We are not the type to overpack)

Also in my research I keep coming back to travelpro brand. is this a sturdy/good brand? Anyone swear by any another brand (moderately priced)?

t3_1fvnxm4,Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) Exemptions,"Hi all,

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

I have also emailed the various embassies and consulates but 1) it's Friday and 2) I'm flying out next week and not currently in the UK, so keen to get as much info as I can from as many sources 😅 

Many thanks in advance!!!

Although I see this in their local and Regional plans, the reason I ask this is more or less to do with NordVPN. I know Saily was created by NordVPN which you may of heard has had multiple reports this year saying it doesn't work anymore.

I've been recommended to get an eSIM in addition to a VPN for China.

I'm looking at going to go to multiple countries around Asia, China being one. So I have been looking at Asia/Regional plans with good amount of data for good pricing.

I'm looking for one that will allow me to use Whatsapp and/messenger to call family back home (and having both an eSIM and VPN were highly recommended). So I'm wondering if Saily has been working fine for people even if NordVPN isn't?

I'm from Aotearoa (New Zealand) so the idea of a global eSIM is a bit tricky to find at a good price.

I budgeted about 6K total for the trip, is what I have leftover enough to have good food/cool experiences with?

For reference, just booked my flights via Delta and Aer Lingus for about $2500 total round trip for both me and my S/O, coming from Chicago. Booked all of our lodging for about $800 total for 6 nights. We’re staying in East Lothian (East Liston for 2 nights &amp; Haddington 4 nights).

So far as getting around is concerned, we won’t have a car. I’m hoping to rely on both ride share and the trains for travel around the coast (North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady, Musselburgh, Dunbar, etc). Any suggestions on what is most cost effective? Is this a reliable way to get around relatively efficiently? Obviously we’ll plan to do a lot of walking around in each village/area, but getting to each area is my main focus here. Is Uber reliable in that area? Are the trains fairly inexpensive? 

Still looking for cool pubs, restaurants, sights, etc in each of the places I mentioned. Obviously we’ll stumble on some hidden gems just walking around, but any suggestions are much appreciated!

Just fyi, I’d like to exclude Edinburgh for the most part. But I’d love for someone to change my mind! I’ve heard there’s a lot of tourist traps around the city and with that comes more excessive spending which we’re trying to avoid. 

Again, any advice and comments are much appreciated.

Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

I need a recommendation between Fort William and Inverness for the remaining 3 full days that we have. We still want to stay in a town/village big enough to grab breakfast in the morning and some pubs and restaurants for the evenings. We would like to go and sightsee during the day whatever that might entail. We will have a car. Hiking, boat rides, island hopping, whiskey distilleries, lakes etc. we aren’t very particular but would be looking for around 8-10 hour excursions each day including the drive. 

I know this is probably not specific enough. Just looking for recommendations from maybe ppl who have spent a lot of time in both areas as “home bases.” What will give us a better and dare I use the annoying word “authentic” experience of the natural beauty of Scotland?",1727965415.0,2024-10-08 10:34:48

I moved out from my home in New Orleans to Phoenix for some work that is coming to a close around mid-November. Afterwards, I’m planning on driving home, BUT with a twist! This time, I wanna take a bit of an adventure around the West Coast since I’m not out here a lot, and because it’s apparently beautiful around here for the last few months of the year, so I figured I’d have a drive around here for a few weeks before I head on home!

For details, I’ll be driving all the time, so no flights, but budget also shouldn’t be much of a gap to worry about since I came out here for work anyway. I enjoy all types of stuff, from the outdoors to historical stuff and the more fun activity type places, and my top priority is to do some awesome experience, see some amazing things, and have a blast before I head back home!

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting.

t3_1fvpzkk,Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1727943901.0,2024-10-08 10:34:48

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point).",1727943868.0,2024-10-08 10:34:48

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? ",1727895112.0,2024-10-08 10:34:48

We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence.

Edit: for everyone replying “you should keep it on anyway when seated” I 100% agree with you and do that myself. I’m only talking about getting up to use the restroom, grab something from the overhead bin, etc. ",1727974645.0,2024-10-08 10:34:48

t3_1fumo9j,Thoughts on this - starting your career early vs travelling the world whilst your young,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been pondering this question a lot lately and would love to get some diverse perspectives: Is it better to start your career early or to travel the world while you’re young?

I see the value in both sides and am struggling to decide which path to take. On one hand, I’m keen to establish my career and secure my future. On the other hand, I feel like I might miss out on incredible experiences and personal growth opportunities that come from traveling.

What are your thoughts? Have any of you chosen one path over the other? If so, how did it impact your life? Any advice or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot!

t3_1fv2tyc,EU and Schengen travel ban with travel thereafter ,"Hi there. 

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen? 

Exhausted google searches and relevant sites. Any information would be appreciated. 

Thank you.

t3_1fun8lm,16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

t3_1fuh6qq,Three weeks in Taiwan this November,"1. Is November a good time to go?  Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;
Paying for a parking ticket in Verona (through post office);
Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened?

t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place",1727805935.0,2024-10-08 10:34:48

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you.",1727936827.0,2024-10-08 10:34:48

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

Possibly take the ferry to Fort de France for a night in Martinique, not sure if this is worth it or how it would work.

Take some form of transport to Soufriere to stay there for the remainder of the trip, so 3 or 4 nights. Beach days, exploring the town, and we want to hike the Gran Piton. Then fly back out through Hewanorra.

I’m currently living in the Netherlands (since past 7 years), and I’ve renounced my Pakistani nationality few years ago. I’ve traveled to about 35 countries across Europe, Asia, and America, and one destination I’ve always wanted to explore is India. I’ve heard so many wonderful things about the cities, culture, and landscapes from my Indian friends here in the Netherlands, which has made me even more eager to visit. I’ve actually wanted to travel to India for quite some time now, to experience everything I’ve heard about firsthand.

I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into how difficult or easy it might be to get a visa for India as someone of Pakistani origin? Are there any specific restrictions or places I might not be able to visit because of my background?

I’m just looking for any helpful information or experiences regarding the visa process and any potential travel limitations. I would really appreciate your advice. I’m approaching this with the utmost respect and a genuine desire to explore and learn.

t3_1ftl7an,Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.",1727780037.0,2024-10-08 10:34:49

t3_1fu4hfm,Solo traveler planning Alsace wine + foodie trip 12/2 - 12/5. Recommendations please!,"I'm a 38/F planning a solo trip to Alsace in early December and am trying to figure out my itinerary including where to stay, eat, and the best options for visiting wineries! I'm hoping for some recommendations on how to cut costs where possible and spend more where it counts.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne. Historically I've done semi-private tours but I'd definitely be open to saving money if I can get around by myself either via car or the Kut'Zig - I'm not sure if there are wineries that are easy to access/open to the public or by appointment to someone outside the industry.

I also would love to hit up the Strasbourg Christmas market for maybe an afternoon, but wine, food, and wandering/exploring are higher priorities for this trip vs. more ""touristy"" activities like visiting castles, etc. 

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access. Wherever I stay, I'll mainly be there just to sleep but it's important that it's safe and clean, but would flex for the right experience (again as long as I can make up for added costs elsewhere!)

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days? 

Budget: im hoping to get the price under 2.000$ just for this week for hotels, food and daily activities.

Since we are probably not going there anytime soon anymore we would like to add as much as possible.

If so would you do it again? Would you recommend partial or full? Is it insane to go to Panama city for just a day to go through the Canal?,1727848517.0,2024-10-08 10:34:49

t3_1fucwpf,Boarding pass not assigned at check in (online),"Is it just me or have others noticed that there airlines seem less likely to assign a boarding pass when you do online check in? Seems like I always used to check in online, get my boarding pass, and then show up at the airport ready to go.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass. But that means having to go and line up at the  bag drop line and that can take an hour at least. As I have no bags to drop that makes for a very frustrating experience!

  
Edit: this is flights to/from US, UK, France, Netherlands.

This seems like a new frustration and has happened on BA, Air France and KLM on my last few flights.

Is there a trick I am missing here? Let me know if this is just normal nowadays or or if there's something I am doing wrong.

Example airline email:

Dear passenger, 

You have successfully checked in! Please note: We cannot provide you the boarding pass online now, you need to obtain it at the airport.

**How to obtain your boarding pass:**

* Come early to the airport on the day of your flight to make sure you have enough time to obtain your boarding pass.
* Go to a check-in counter, even if you travel with hand baggage only.
* Once all necessary steps are taken, one of our agents will provide you with a boarding pass to go through security checkpoints and to board your flight.",1727864783.0,2024-10-08 10:34:49
t3_1fu7qpc,Iberia Missed Connection and Cancelled Flight ,"Hello Everyone, 

Long time lurker and first time poster looking for some guidance please. 

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

t3_1fu4o30,What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible. 

I posted on my Instagram story what happened and had 13 ppl reaching out that they went through the same thing with AirSerbia :(((((/ one of my friend who is originally from Belgrade sent me an email address that is at their LOST AND FOUND office door in Belgrade ( ???? ) and after I sent an email there, they responded that my baggage was still in Belgrade ( ???? ). When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!!

t3_1ft24dp,"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

I'm kicking off a solo adventure around a few spots in SEA with a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and was wondering if its worth staying in a hostel or if I should just go with a regular hotel. Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

To travelers who have been to KL before, is it worth trying to stay in a hostel or should I just play it safe and start off in a hotel?

t3_1fu51xf,Has anyone staying at Dubai International Hotel in DXB airport been able to leave and re-enter?,"Background:   US citizen. 17 hour layover in Dubai before my connecting flight with fly Dubai. Room booked at the Dubai International Hotel at the airport. My checked luggage will be tagged through to the final destination and I will obtain all boarding passes needed when at the origin airport. 

Question: Will I be able leave and return to airport hotel to sleep before my flight? I know I’ll have to clear customs to leave and that is fine. However, I’m reading conflicting information about not being able to return to the hotel until 3 hours prior to flight when check-in opens. I’m assuming I will already be checked in given that I’ll have my boarding pass to final destination and my luggage is checked all the way through. So, I’m not sure if hotel access only 3 hours before flight applies to me. I’d really like to explore in the afternoon and return around 10 pm. 

Has anyone done this recently? Any help would be appreciated. ",1727833553.0,2024-10-08 10:34:49
t3_1fu03t7,Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?",1727819290.0,2024-10-08 10:34:49

t3_1fst66x,"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",1727695522.0,2024-10-08 10:34:49
t3_1fso6rm,12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

t3_1fsu2ec,Hotel / Resort fees getting out of control?,"
Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

My only requests for this trip are trying a NYC hotdog and a slice of pizza (LOL), seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, going to the American Museum of Natural History, and finding some good dessert spots/other eateries. He is not a sweets/sugar person so he has left me in charge of that.

I am planning a trip to Morocco and in my plan, I'll take the ferry from Tangier to Tarifa, then local transportation to Malaga. Simple answer to this route, rather than just fly away, is that I wan to try something fun, and the Strait of Gilbralter is on my checklist as well. The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

However, I'd like to consult your experiences if I should do Tangier-Tarifa or TangierMed-Algeciras.

I will be staying in the town of Tangier, for the eve.

Besides, I am a bit uncertain about the local transportation between Tarifa and Algeciras. Rome2Rio tells me that there are regular bus routs operated by local transportation company. My concern is that what about the fare and how should I pay the ticket? Does it take credit card? or I should buy the ticket somewhere?

After arriving Malaga, I will be staying Malaga for 2 nights and then fly back. Should I book my day tour to Granada and Alhambra?

Day 1 (Oct 13): PM - arrive late to Montreux from Geneva, dinner. 

Day 2: AM - Walk to Chillon Castle, boat tour if time/weather line up. 
PM: Lavaux vineyards walk (Cully -Saint Saphorin). Dinner there/Montreux. 

Day 3: Gruyeres - chateau du Gruyeres, HR Giger Museum (we are Alien fans lol), etc. Train back to Montreux/dinner 

Day 4: AM - train to Zermatt 
PM - Stellisee lake weather permitting/Zermatt bopping 

Day 5: AM - Early Gornergrat, Riffelsee, proposal 🥳. Matterhorn glacier if time/weather 
PM: BEAUSite spa. Dinner at Omnia. 

Day 6: AM - train to Wengen. 
PM: Mannlichen-kleine schedegg if weather permits/lauterbrunnen valley option 

Day 7: (all options) Murren North face hiking, gimmewald, Eiger Trail, schilthorn, jungfraujoch

Day 8: see day 7. Mix/match accordingly 

Day 9: AM - lauterbrunnen valley 1 last time. Train to Lucerne. 
PM - bop around Lucerne 

Day 10: Lucerne City exploring. Old village, museums, boating weather permitting, etc. 

Day 11: rigi/pilatus/stoos ridge (still deciding - open to suggestions). 

Day 12: AM: train to Zurich (maybe stop in Zug for lunch??). 
PM: bop around Zurich 

Day 13: Zurich exploring, museums etc. 

Day 14: depart 

Weather may dictate some of these days. Have thought about training to Bern on any rainy days or other locations. We are pretty flexible and enjoy both hiking and city exploring. Have lived in Colorado for many years and understand October hiking will be layers, beanies, gloves.

t3_1ftmues,"Looking for advice, TAP or KLM for a trip to Brazil?","Hi everyone, I want to travel to Brazil (FLN, return from BSB or GYN) from the Netherlands (AMS) in March. The only viable options seem to be TAP (via Lisbon) or KLM (via São Paulo or Rio).

Something that's important to me is possibly being able to get assistance. I'm autistic, I can take care of myself so it's not a necessity but it'd help a lot. I know the sunflower lanyard is known with KLM but TAP doesn't seem to be trained with it. I'm not sure if it's known with the domestic airlines in Brazil.

I also have some questions about the São Paulo/Rio airports. What's it like having to switch from international to domestic flights? Do I have to check in all over again, is it far away? Is it easy to find English speaking personnel? This is one of my boyfriends' worries since I don't speak PT very well.

I saw I'd possibly have to do a ""self-transfer"" in Lisbon, what is this like? Also, does anyone know if TAPs prices ever lower again? The price recently got raised and hasn't gone down again.

To me the TAP flights seem easier, times are perfect (good layovers too!), but I'm not sure how reliable they are. I read a lot about baggage rules, but I don't mind putting in extra effort to make sure I'm not going over the limits. To be honest, I'd do that no matter the airline. What would be the best choice in my case? TAP or KLM?",1727785686.0,2024-10-08 10:34:49

Is this too good to be true or a scam? I don't want to book her ticket, have her show up at the airport, and this isn't even legit. The Indian embassy is useless here too, as there is no number to call, and if you make an appointment, they can barely speak English or convey anything properly.

So I said great I'm in the right spot. However, both those lines were going on 2 separate buses to the same place. When it came time to scan my ticket the driver said ""this isn't your bus"". I said how? I was told to come to this line and it's going to my destination. He said you missed your bus. And no, I did not come late. I was an hour in half early, my bus literally left minutes before. I asked can he please let me on the bus he said ""how much you got"" and was saying other very rude stuff to me but I digress. I lied and said I only have $20 so I gave him cash for him to let me on the bus. 

I contacted greyhound only wanting to get a partial refund of $20 on my ticket but they are of course saying it's nonrefundable. How is this my fault at all? Their app clearly said get in line D or E and the employee told me line D. The employees didn't even do calls for which bus is going where. You just had to assume what like to get in.

t3_1ft5pl2,7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)",1727728123.0,2024-10-08 10:34:50

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

Sincerely,

Highly anxious Male, 26, currently smoking their cigarettes. ",1727774295.0,2024-10-08 10:34:50
t3_1ftqahj,Is a 5 hour flight then 4 hour train journey doable?,"Hi there.  Is a five hour flight and then a four hour train journey doable without becoming exhausted?

I am suppose to be flying (from Istanbul at 11:50am) to Casablanca Mon, 28 Oct, arriving **14:50** (5h flight duration) and was planning to take a train from Casa airport to Fez (four hours), where I would check-in to a hotel for three nights.

However, I'm now wondering whether this is a bad move.  Should I check-in at a hotel in Casablanca for one night, then travel to Fes the next morning?

Alternatively, if it's during the day (and it is) and I can travel first class by train (and no need to pre-book - just turn up and get the next train - there's one every hour), then should I be okay?

I'd rather go straight to Fes (have nothing to do in Casa), but I don't want to exhaust myself either.

Arrival: BCN 

Direct flight   A300-200 

  
**My parent's flight to Barcelona**

1. they purchased a ticket months ago. One way ticket.

**Problem** 

1. Cancelation  A day before the flight, the initial flight was canceled, and they got re-assigned to a different flight day later. 

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. ",1727729597.0,2024-10-08 10:34:50

Racism &amp; Overall Safety - I’m an Asian woman so… I never had unpleasant experience in any part of Austria but was wondering about Amsterdam.

We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year. We only speak English (and Chinese but obviously won't be helpful in Georgia!)

t3_1fsynxo,Is the Hopper website legit? ,"I'm looking for flights to Paris from Toronto for a week starting October 17/18, and everywhere else I have checked is charging at least $900 in total, but when I checked Hopper, it's saying my overall trip will cost $641, which seems too good to be true.

Our flight from JFK got cancelled 24 hours before check in, and they rebooked us which now gets us getting there on the 3rd.

t3_1fru0rh,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",1727575803.0,2024-10-08 10:34:50
t3_1fswfii,Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia. 

I would love any feedback, location suggestions, or just to hear your favorite places to spend a week! Thanks!!",1727705308.0,2024-10-08 10:34:50

t3_1ft9id1,Bachelor Party Recommendations? (I'm the Last to Get Married),"So, I'm the last to get married among my group of guy friends and the last to try to plan a bachelor party. Admittedly, I've fallen a bit behind on planning something (I get married in May 2025). My fiance and I have another trip planned in March 2025 (Mexico), so I'm looking at either February or April for when to travel.

Among my friends, we've already done Vegas, Destin, Nashville, Charleston, hometown, and many who have elected to do nothing (multiple elopements and a Covid wedding). It's a group of roughly 10-12 guys. We are all in our early 30s. We're into good food and drinks, games (any kind, I've seen them turn a bottle cap into a drinking game), professional (and unprofessional?) sports, beaches, pools, and water activities. Not big clubbers, golfers, or hikers.

Personally, I love to cook, I like a boat and a lake, to visit an art museum, I tend to be nerdier, and my games of preference are card and board game.

Things that have been batted around in conversation: Ireland (too far for the dads), Montreal, Banff, Lake Tahoe, All Inclusive Resort (don't know where), Lakeside Cabin (don't know where), Austin, Chicago. Not sure if those primers help!

* Dates: February or April 2025
* Locations: Canada, USA, Central America, Caribbean
* Group Details: 10-12, 30ish yo Males, located on East Coast USA
* Vibes: Beers, Good Food, Games/Group Activities, Water (a plus, not necessary)
* Not Vibes: Clubs, Golf Courses, Appalachian Trail

t3_1ft45ni,Where to solo travel for 5 nights in late October for some type I fun?,"I have a week off between jobs and want to make the most of it, but my husband won't be able to join me. I have done some solo travel before and have learned that I'm happiest with small group tasks/activities during the day, otherwise I get a bit aimless and lonely. I am outdoorsy but more into type I versus type II fun. I'm fairly competent on bikes and horses and hikes, but I don't want to summit any mountains and I get lonely camping alone.  I live in a city and prefer nature when I travel.

  
Given all of this and my late October timeframe, any ideas on where to go?  I am on the east coast of the USA and would prefer to remain within a reasonably easy flight (while avoiding any areas that are at a high risk of a hurricane).  I am seriously craving sun after the recent weather here, post Helene.  I can comfortably spend 2-3K on this trip.

Ideas are either:
A) Somewhere super relaxing but hot so it’s a change and we can go in a pool / chill outdoors. 
In my head this would mean going quite far to say Bali or Mexico…

B) Say f*** it and be those people that take a baby to Japan because I’m dying to go.

C) Road trip round the states
Can’t decide if this is stupid given we can only drive 2 hours before taking breaks with the baby… 

D) Alternative ideas in Europe that avoid a longer flight?!

t3_1ftfa1m,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",1727755390.0,2024-10-08 10:34:50

We're leaving our 3yo at home with the grandparents and this might be one of our last kid-free trips. I'm torn between wanting to make the most of it and actually relaxing. Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.

t3_1fsoc62,Vietnam Itinerary Help (13 Nights),"Hi, we will be in Vietnam 13th-26th October (13 nights), we had an idea on where we wanted to go and how many nights to spend in each but when it comes to actually planning it, I am not sure if we should drop Hoi An so it doesn’t feel rushed. We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)
17th: Overnight train to Ninh Binh
18th: Ninh Binh (arrive in morning from train)
19th: Ninh Binh
20th: Return to Hanoi (for Ha Long next morning)
21st: Ha Long Cruise (overnight) 
22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa
25th: Hanoi
26th: Flight home (evening)

This results in a total 5 nights in Hanoi, 2 nights in Hoi An, 2 nights in Ninh Binh, 1 night in Ha Long, 2 nights in Sapa, and 1 on a train. Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

Thanks.

t3_1fsqxf2,Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!",1727685997.0,2024-10-08 10:34:50

t3_1fsm1qw,Compare Flighty Vs Tripsy,"Hello everyone,

  
I'm an avid traveler. I usually like to keep my flights tracked through apps. I'm not too concerned with tracking hotel stays or car rental stuff, but it's good when I need it. I usually stay at Hilton hotels and use Avis for car rentals. Unless something unusual makes me deviate from either brand, I'm sticking to them. Flights on the other hand, are usually across many airlines. I like to keep a history of my flights too, just to see where I've been, so I do like the passport feature from Flighty.

I recently discovered Tripsy, I like the UI and I like the general itinerary record. I see that there is a flight/visited record feature, so that's a nice feature. This app reminds me of TripIt. I've used TripIt before, I didn't like the UI though. I didn't like the feel of the TripIt app, but I did love their website, which I ended up using far more than the app. One really great feature, although it's a pro feature, is the expense record keeping of Tripsy. It's really nice to see that immediately and not have to do that on the budgeting app.

I could go on and on about both apps. Again, I've used TripIt, I'm favoring Tripsy out of those two. But what are your thoughts of flight/itenarary keeping of both Flighty and Tripsy? Specifically, I'm thinking of getting a pro membership, so which one feels like you're getting your monies worth?

t3_1froz5i,Money comments on having just returned from a trip to the UK.,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks in the UK, mostly touring by train and car. Wonderful trip but I noticed two things I didn't expect.

The UK was expensive! I would rank it right up there with Switzerland. We stayed in three star hotels and B&amp;B's, rated 8.0 or higher on Booking. We paid US$350 per night in London and Edinburgh, US$250 or less in the countryside, breakfast included. Restaurant prices were high too, we paid pound for dollar. Meaning that a pasta dish would cost GBP20, which is US$26. A burger might be GBP16 = US$21. Gasoline cost around US$8.50 per US gallon. Entrance fees for attractions were high, up significantly from the Rick Steve's prices we saw in a four year old book. Like US$40 to see Stonehenge. Museums in London were still free.

British restaurants have caught the tipping disease. They use hand held. point of sale devices for card payments (normal) and the bill almost always included an ""optional service charge"" of 10%. The server would point out that it's optional but there it was, already added into the bill. Incidentally, quite a few restaurants, pubs and deli's are cashless. It was payment by card only. If you go make sure you have a chip card. (Pay toilets in the parks cost 20 pence to use and no longer accept coins. You have to tap your credit card -- chip -- and you're in. It shows up as a 27 cent charge on your CC bill.)

Transportation: The train was expensive too, although we didn't try to book ahead to save money and did walk-up ticket purchases. London to York cost US$94 per person, second class. Car rental was a pleasant surprise. We reserved with Enterprise from the US five months before the trip and were pleased with both the price and the service. And you don't need an Oyster card for the London underground anymore. You can use a chip card in the same way and you get the same fare as with an Oyster card. You just tap in and tap out.

t3_1frdbjj,Brussels is Terrible,"Brussels was... underwhelming 

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels. 

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.  

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert. 

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck. 

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? ",1727526963.0,2024-10-08 10:34:51

I am travelling to a region where the electricity supply is 220V.

I have a Samsung Galaxy phone. The OEM phone charger is dual voltage 100V - 240V. So no problem there. All I need is a suitable plug adapter so I can plug the OEM charger in their wall socket. 

Then I find a plug adapter on Amazon that has also a built-in USB port in additional to the regular US receptacles. The seller makes it very clear that this is just a plug adapter but not a voltage converter. 

Some people say because the adapter doesn't convert the voltage from 220V to 110V, I should plug your phone into the OEM phone charger (which take either voltage) and then plug the OEM phone charger into the wall socket via the plug adapter.

However, other people say you can skip the OEM phone charger and plug the phone directly into the USB ports using just the USB cord. They claim that even though the adapter isn't a voltage converter but the USB port will only output 5V, so the phone is safe.

Who is correct? Any real life experience?

t3_1fsjkpr,Destination indecision - thoughts wanted,"Hoping for some insight! Talking a two week trip at the end of November but can’t decide where. Getting close to being too late.

About me:

Traveling alone, single mid 40s male.

East Coast USA based.

Generally I love big cities but I also lean much more towards relaxing more than adventure. Beaches are ok. Hiking does nothing for me.

Which also means I generally don’t like more than 2 cities. 3 at a push. 1 is even fine if there are a bunch of day trips.

Museums are ok. Love street food and foodie stuff (non gourmet) in general.

Love things like replica markets. Love places like Akihabara.

Love animals so something like a town full of deer or monkeys or seeing elephants etc sounds great.

Pretty tall so long haul is hell unless I get a bulk head seat. This makes flights more expensive for me due to buying upgrades to get those seats.

Safety is huge for me. Hence why Colombia or Brazil or something doesn’t really interest me.

Would enjoy some dates while on vacation. At the very least mingling with locals. I love meeting people from different countries.

Destinations I’m considering most:

Asia:
Usually prefer Asia. 

Have been to Japan 3x already. Over a month in Tokyo, couple weeks in Osaka. Have been to Yokohama, Kyoto, Nara, and Kyoto already. I could spend a year in Tokyo honestly. But also feel like I should go see more places which would be Hiroshima, Nagoya, or Hokkaido next, preference wise. I also am conversational in Japanese and have a friend I might be able to see a couple days there. It also feels like a waste to learn Japanese and then not go to Japan. But it also feels silly on the other hand to only ever go to Japan. Catch-22 I guess. 

Philippines. Beaches! Manila looks chaotic but fun. People seem insanely friendly. Cebu area couple be cool. I’ve kind of been scared off of the infrastructure there but I don’t think that’s a huge deal just sort of an annoyance.

Thailand. 3 messages a day sounds great. Easy metro in Bangkok. My favorite type of food is Thai. Amazing looking old ruins and temples. This was my first plan before I started second guessing myself.

Vietnam maybe. Love the food.

However, SE Asia in general is about 30-35 hours each way which one, is insane (Japan is only around 17) and two, I lose two to three days of vacation to planes and airports. I also don’t sleep almost at all on planes so i might be going days without more than a few hours sleep and lose even more vacation time.


Americas:

Costa Rica. Just seems nice. I don’t know.  But is two weeks here too much?

Europe:

Portugal. Have always wanted to go. Looks great. Affordable.  Great food. Also I have a friend who would come see me for a weekend here which could be fun. 

Spain? So many great cities to see like Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastien, etc.

Italy. Would love to see Tuscany and Rome and Naples. Pompeii is a major bucket list place. Great food. Bucket list in general it’s freaking Italy. The ruins, the museums, the food, the countryside, it all just seems great. Same friend that would meet me for a weekend in Portugal would also be willing to meet for a weekend in Italy. 

But I’ve been hemming and hawing for like six weeks now. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m annoying friends by constantly talking about it and changing my preference even multiple times a day. I just cannot make my mind up. So figured I’d get some advice from people that have done a lot of traveling on here. Or even people that haven’t and just have opinions! I have to make a decision soon or I’m gonna screw up and see nothing but way overpriced flights. I’m already getting close to that I feel like.

Any thoughts or help making a decision or advice on the act of making a travel decision, which never used to be this hard I’m not sure why I’m torturing myself this year, is appreciated!",1727657972.0,2024-10-08 10:34:51
t3_1fs67vq,How to plan South Africa safari?,"I'm overwhelmed looking at these all-inclusive trip options. Mostly by the cost.

Does anyone have recommendations? I'd be fine with an all inclusive, all out luxury safari option for 3-4K per person for 3 days, but I think I can probably do Cape Town on my own.

t3_1fseezq,Looking for ways to travel while I work remotely,"Hi all,

I’ve been working from home for a few years now. When I started working remotely the goal was to travel to different places while also working during the day, then explore on weekends and after work. My current remote job is based out of a hospital in Boston. We are allowed to encrypt our personal laptops but we are told to not use them for long periods of time.. they don’t give us work lap tops, I only have a big monitor which I cannot travel with. I’m curious to know how others may be doing this. I feel like giving us the option to be remote but then not let us have the freedom that comes with it defeats the purpose a little bit! 

I do have a little black box that plugs into my monitor (not sure of what to call it lol).. is there a smaller more portable screen I can buy and plug that into? It’s a Dell!

I'll be getting back to Bangkok in mid March and then I'll have about 4 weeks before I fly to New Delhi (from wherever I end up at)

I was initially planning to go down to Phuket briefly to check out Khao Sok for a few days and then use Koh Lanta as my base to check out the Thai islands for about 10 days since Phuket just doesn't sound like my thing. Afterwards I would go to Singapore for a few days and then Malaysia for just under 2 weeks.

However, Western Malaysia is supposed to be super wet in April and I've already been to jungles in central America and will in Vietnam and Thailand as well, so I don't know if it will be worth it. I'm also not sure if there will be enough to do without breaking the bank to spend 10 days on Koh Lanta, so I may have anywhere from 8-16 extra days to do something that is a cheap plane ride from Phuket/Singapore/KL.

I'm currently only going to be spending about 7/8 days in Cambodia between Siem Reap + PP and their surroundings, so I could theoretically add some time here. I'm also interested in Bali (less so after hearing about how touristy it is), eastern Malaysia, anywhere I can climb big mountains without having to pay for a guide, nice beaches (preferably with  waves of like 3-6ft, but I'm happy with anything)

Any recommendations for places to go or things to check out?

t3_1fs9ju6,Visiting Miami from Ireland at the End of October – Any Tips/Suggestions for My 6-Day Itinerary?,"\*\*Dia duit mo chairde!\*\* (That's ""Hello my friends!"" in Irish)

As the title suggests, I will visit your fine city at the end of October. I'm really looking forward to the trip as it will be my first time in Miami, albeit I've been to Florida (Daytona, Tampa and Orlando) when I was younger.

Although there's a small group of us travelling, we each arrive on different days, which has given me plenty of time in advance to draw up a plan of things I'd like to see and do. I've also booked some activities in advance.

If you'd be so kind, I'd like the people of this subreddit to review my itinerary, offer some suggestions of things I should add or remove, provide some general advice about the city and overall, provide some constructive feedback. This trip wasn't cheap, and Miami is a city I've always wanted to see, so I want to ensure it goes as well as possible! The primary reason I'm travelling is to see my favourite NFL team (The Arizona Cardinals) take on your Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.

I've reviewed some tourism posts within this subreddit over the past few months and have also come across some fantastic suggestions from users, so thank you for that!

Below, I'll try and go into as much detail as possible regarding what I plan to do over the six days. Please also forgive me in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors I may have mistyped. I've been reviewing this post for about an hour to make sure it's perfect (This is my third read-through..). Anyway, I hope this post doesn't end up too long, boring or deleted by the Mods. So without further ado, please see below:

# Day 1 - Coral Gables

I arrive at Miami International Airport at 5:30 PM and will have to go through immigration. I hope this doesn't take too long! From there, I plan to take an Uber or Lyft to my accommodation. This should only take about 15-20 minutes according to Google Maps.

Once checked into my hotel in West Flagler, the plan is to take an Uber or Lyft to the Coral Gables area to explore some bars. Clubbing isn't my scene, so dive bars where I can watch sports and talk to people are right up my street. (Is this called a 'Dive bar?')

I'm going to a bar called... ""The Bar"" followed by John Martin's Irish bar. If I have the time, I might go to Tap42 bar. I also think I'll stick to bottles of beer while in Miami, as I don't want to end up a sloppy drunk. I like Miller and Bud Light, which I think most bars in the city provide.

After, It's another Uber/Lyft to Se7as bar, which looks like great fun according to Google. Since I'm Irish, I then plan to visit Duffy's Tavern - which looks like such a chill spot.

And that's about as exciting as Day 1 gets! It will probably be after 7 PM by the time I get to leave the hotel, and I'll probably be tired after travelling by air all day. As for food, I'll eat in one or two of the bars.

# Day 2 -Little Havana and Downtown

If I've time, I'll visit a grocery store to pick up a few snacks. The hotel provides plenty, but I'll still make the visit for a basic shop.

I'll then head to Little Havana (I'll walk if I'm okay for time) as I've booked a Walking Tour which embraces you in Cuban Culture. It also brings you to places where Cuban Cigars are made, Cuban Food and a lesson on some historic Cuban sites. Looking forward to it!

Once this is done. I might stick around the neighbourhood to explore it a little more, but eventually, I need to get to the Downtown (I'll most likely walk) area as I've booked a Cruise from Sunset to darkness. This should last about an hour.

Once done, I'll explore downtown. I've noted that I should visit Over/Under, Mama Tried and The Lost Boy venues for a drink and some food. Thankfully these are located near to each other.

Once tired, it's an Uber/Lyft home.

# Day 3 - Wynwood, Biscayne Bay and Miami vs FSU in Hard Rock

Uber/Lyft again, this time to see the Wynwood walls. I booked a tour for about $15 and it takes about an hour. Looking forward to it! I had considered buying a ticket for the Buggy Tour, but it was $50, maybe it's worth it?

I'll then visit Gramps Bar for a bite to eat and a bottle of beer.

Walk to the Museum of Hip-Hop. I'm a big Hip-Hop fan, so getting to visit this should be great! I haven't bought a ticket yet, I think it's about $15. I'm also considering visiting the Museum of Graffiti. I'm undecided since the walls will already contain plenty of artwork.

Uber/Lyft to Biscayne Bay and visit Flannigans, which I know is a meme on this Subreddit. I think it's the Rib Rolls I have to try. Anyway, I'll watch the NCAAF games while I'm there as it's not too far from Hard Rock Stadium and have a beer or two.

Uber/Lyft to the stadium. I'm banking on this game being a late kickoff, but FSU doesn't look good at all, and the Miami Hurricanes do. I've a feeling it may be a 3:30 PM kickoff which means I'll have to alter my plans for the day entirely. My seat is at Midfield, in the nose bleeds, but close to the front of the section. It's the Hurricanes' sideline, so no sun issues regardless of kick-off time.

I was at the Georgia Tech and FSU game in Dublin, Ireland and purchased an FSU T-shirt. It's Irish branded and has the team's logo, will I be okay wearing this T-shirt or will it cause trouble? I'm hoping it'll be a conversation starter with people on the day. I'm looking forward to seeing the Miami team, the QB Cam Ward has impressed me over the past 2 weeks.

Once the game is done, I'll have to head back to the hotel. This might be an issue of traffic, but I have an early start on Sunday.

# Day 4 - Dolphins vs Cardinals in Hard Rock

It's an Uber/Lyft to the Miami Dolphins Tailgate near the stadium. A friend who lives there has kindly invited us along. This means I'll need to be there from around 10 AM to 10:30 AM.

Meet my buddies at the tailgate, enjoy it and enter the stadium for the game.

Here's the kicker, I'm on the side where the sun beams down. I read so much advice that I shouldn't do this, but I got a great offer on a seat at midfield so close to the field and I'm on the Cardinal sideline. Other options were in Row Z of the Dolphin sideline and cost more money. I am not sitting with my buddies, but that's okay.

After the game, the evening is wide open. I'm going to do whatever my friends want to do, which means probably going to Mid-Beach or South Beach to watch the evening games in a bar. This will be costly, but it's only one evening.

When it's home time, Uber/Lyft of course.

# Day 5 - South, Mid and North Beach, followed by Heat vs Pistons

When I decide to crawl out of bed with probably a hangover, I plan to visit the island. I plan to start from the bottom (South Pointe Park) and walk northwards for the day. Google Maps says this is doable in a few hours, but I have until 7 PM with pit stops here and there, so I'm in no hurry.

Maybe I'll rent a bike to explore South Pointe Park?

So, I've drawn up a list of sights I should see along the way on my walk, starting south and moving north, please see below:

1. South Pointe Park
2. Visit Ted's Hideaway
3. Miami Beach Boardwalk
4. Ocean Drive and Art Deco
5. Flamingo/Hummus
6. Mac's Club Deuce
7. Espanola Way
8. The Abbey Bar
9. Collins Avenue
10. Holocaust Memorial
11. Sunset Harbour (Maybe?)
12. Lost Weekend Bar (Maybe?)

Once that is all said and done, it's an Uber/Lyft to the Kaseya Arena for the Miami Heat and Detroit Pistons game. I'm sat pretty high up and far back, but hopefully I enjoy the game. Basketball is a sport I loved when I was younger, I even supported the Heat because Dwayne Wade was my favourite player, so it's a pleasure to get to see the team, live!

After that, it's home to bed.

# Day 6 - Advice Needed, No plans made as of yet

I'm considering either travelling to Fort Lauderdale or to the Miami Everglades, but honestly I am totally undecided. I'm open to any other suggestions from you locals, as well!

The Everglades was my original plan, but 2 people have told me it wasn't that good. I'd be doing the typical tourist thing - boat ride, a wildlife show etc.

Fort Lauderdale looks fabulous from the pictures I've seen online. I will have to travel there by train, though. When there, I think I'll do a cruise which lasts an hour or two.

# Day 7 - Hop on/Hop off Bus Tour, Airport and Home to Ireland

I've decided on going with the bus tour so I can take in the sights one final time and stop off at some places which I never got to see over the 6 days. I'm lucky that my bag will be stored away somewhere safe, so I won't need to worry about it until it's time to go to the airport.

My flight is at 10PM, so I have the entire day to see everything one final time.

# Other things I feel I should add

I've stumbled upon a list (Sorry, I've saved this post as a draft twice now) I curated with questions I'd like to ask locals. Please see below:

* What food should I get in Flannigan's? Rib Rolls or something else?
* I'm not a big beach guy, meaning I won't be going swimming. However, I will of course take a trip to the beach for the sights, to take photographs and all that.
* I wouldn't mind trying Argentinian food. Are there any good spots? I don't want to break the bank either, just try some Argentinian beef!
* Could someone recommend a good sports store? Basically, a big store which sells MLB, NHL, MLS and to a lesser extent NFL merchandise but not limited to Miami based teams... If such a place even exists!

I really can't think of what else to add right now. I just want to make sure I get this post to be right (Please don't delete AutoBot..). I'm not stressing about the trip or anything, I'm just looking to make sure I see/do as much as I can while there. If you've made it this far into the post, I sincerely thank you for reading and hopefully you have some feedback for me.

Looking forward to visiting!",1727630465.0,2024-10-08 10:34:51

t3_1fs51lk,1 week in Peru: MP and Manu NP? Budget-friendly trip,"Husband and I have one week in Peru. I'll be in Tambopata for work for a week, and then we're meeting in Cusco and have a week together. We wanted to see Machu Picchu and Manu National Park (since I'll already have been in Tambopata region and he really wants to see the Amazon.)

We will meet at Cusco airport around 15:00 on 9 November, and then we have a flight back to Lima at 18:45 on 16 November (to then depart back to the US). Neither of us will be checking any bags; just carry-on size (\~40L) backpacks.

Some folks from my work thing are booking a Cusco - MP - Cusco all in one day tour, but at $400 USD pp, it felt pretty steep to us. I'm hoping to put together a more budget-friendly plan.

Does it make sense to:

* Book ahead and take the 16:30 Bus + Train from Wanchaq to Aguascalientes (""Machu Picchu station"") on 9 November ($52pp)

* Book a ho(s)tel in AC for 9 Nov
* Try and find a guide in AC on the day, to take us up to MP on Circuit 2 on 10 November
* Book transit ahead and go back to Cusco on 10 November
* Book accommodation in Cusco for 10 November
* Try and find a tour, in Cusco, on 11 November to take us to Manu, likely leaving in the early AM 12 November and returning 15 November?

The last one is notable for being about $200 cheaper pp than most of the rest of them, which is great but also curious...

t3_1fsd0za,Transfer time for LAX,"Hello,

In a few months, I will be flying internationally for the first time. On December 28th, I will be flying out of SMF and into LAX with my brother via Southwest to transfer to terminal 7 and leave LAX on my international flight.

My SMF -&gt; LAX Flight is scheduled to be from 6:45AM to 8:20AM, to which then my second flight leaves at 11:30AM. These two flights are booked on separate tickets, and in every other connection I have more than enough time to transfer without any worry (the LAX to SMF return flight has a 6+ hour layover).

I'm aware that the terminal I would be arriving in LAX at, Southwest, is at the opposite side of where the United terminal lies, and that I additionally will need to collect and recheck baggage in my 3 hour window. Regardless, is this enough time to make it to my flight?

If I estimate that the flight is \~40 minutes delayed (meaning I am off the plane around 9AM), baggage collection takes \~30 minutes, and we take the \~15 minute walk outside of the airport to cross straight from Southwest to the United terminal (Both my brother and I are able to walk pretty quickly, there's no concern over exhaustion or anything), that would get us depositing luggage around 10AM (+15 minutes accounting for anything else). Then, we would have to get through security and be at the terminal within the remaining time.

I understand that this is a pretty optimistic timeline, and it should also be considered both that this will be early/late morning as well as extremely close to New Years where travel is likely going to be more frequent. With all that in mind, how risky is this decision? This is the earliest direct flight to LAX from SMF we could get.

Thank you!",1727639360.0,2024-10-08 10:34:51

Most my question is in the title. Essentially i am going on a trip with several family members in 2 weeks. We have booked the flight some time ago, but unfortunately one of my family has broken her leg recently and probably won't be able to come along with us.

I am not salty about the money and don't need a refund here. I just want to know for sure how best to proceed since i am worried we might be stuck waiting for a passenger who is not going to show up or something.

Also another question, if her leg does recover until our trip, she will still need to take some injections daily for another 6 or so weeks. She takes them herself. 

We have already spoken to our doctor about getting a note for them, but i don't know if they need to be in some sort of special packaging or if they have to be checked in or if they can be in cabin luggage etc...

t3_jj0cli,American Food Made Me Sick When I Returned From Overseas,"Tl;dr After living abroad for many years I noticed when returning to America the food made me sick. Anyone with a similar experience? 

This happened to me twice over the course of 10 years. When I was 20 years old (2010) I moved to South Korea via orders from the US Army. The food there was definitely fresher. When you went out to eat food was freshly prepared. I felt healthier when I lived there. A large soda was like a 12oz cup. Portions were better controlled. I lived there for two years before returning to the US. When I came back I felt it in my gut immediately. Everything I ate would give me digestive issues. I’d frequent the Asian store to grab some foods I was familiar with and for the fresh kimchi. It took me months before I was use to some of the American food again. 

Flash forward to 2016, I received orders via the US army again, this time to Germany. I lived in Germany for three years. The food by far was some of the freshest I ever tasted. The milk especially. I’ve always loved milk, but after having German milk...I mean it’s the best. I had a local butcher in the village I lived in. They cut fresh meat daily, and a grocery store with fresh vegetables. I’m sure in larger cities there is more of an abundance of processed foods, but I lived in a smaller village. Anyways, I moved back to America in 2019. Ever since, everything makes me sick. I can taste like a chemical taste on some of the bread and meat products. This taste makes me not want to eat anything. I didn’t have it when I came back from South Korea. I’m not sure why now? It’s been a year since I’ve been back, and I don’t get as sick as I use to. I still get sick over the food though, and the taste thing is still prevalent. 

My question is: Has anyone had a similar experience to this?",1603802438.0,2024-10-08 10:34:51

t3_1fy6r62,"A week's long trip to Iceland, September 2024","For a while now I wanted to go to Iceland, and finally did it last month, and I have enjoyed it so much!

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much).

I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience. I am a Ukrainian citizen with a residence permit in the EU.

Recently, while traveling, I accidentally spilled water on my biometric passport. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be heavily affected; the appearance and 99% of the stamps look just like before.

However, I’m concerned about the biometric NFC chip embedded in the passport’s cover. I wasn’t even aware of its existence before. Now that I’ve read about it, I found an app called ReadID and tried to scan the chip — but it’s not being detected :(

For instance, my friend’s passport scans without any issues.

My question is: how critical is this problem? Could it affect border crossings, opening bank accounts, or any other procedures where the passport is required? Does this make the passport invalid? Or is there a chance that official institutions have different devices that might be able to read the chip, even if my phone can’t?

Thank you very much in advance for your reply.

I'll be visiting Ecuador (including the Galápagos Islands for a few days), Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. (I will be spending the least amount of time in Chile and Argentina, if that helps..)

I'm going over my budget again and I'm wondering how much SPENDING money to bring, explicitly spending money. I've accounted for all accomodation and flights, and have estimated the costs of meals, tips, activities etc. so all that's left is money for souvenirs and other knick-knack items, maybe some cocktails here and there. 

I'm thinking between $4000-$6000 AUD (2690 - 4035 USD) roughly. Is this is safe amount?

The cost for two adults and two children (6 and 9) at Castaway might be a bit of a push but everything else has both really positive and really negative reviews usually to do with being outdated, average food etc.

t3_1fyusxc,Unsure if Visa requirements entering China for a layover ,"Hello everyone, could someone please explain the entry requirements for China. In January I’ll be travelling to Australia with my Portuguese partner and whilst we have her visa figured out it’s mine (British citizen) that’s a bit confusing.

I’ve read that if you are only transitioning through the country through a selected airport (which ours is on the list) you don’t need to apply for a visa, you only need to apply for a 24hour permit which allows you to stay only in the airport and you have to prove you have a connecting flight. Our layover will be 9 hours. 

Would I still need to pay for a visa or would I apply for one of those permits before departing the UK or prior to landing in china?

This might not be the right place to ask but if anyone could shed some light on this I’d be great.

It’s October, so obviously YMMV. I’m a keen traveller, mainly in Europe and have visited over 300 small towns and cities. Taormina was right up there for me. The sweets were delicious, we chose a restaurant a bit out of the way of the beaten path, and hiked around the town a bit. We are two young women travelling, based in Catania for the week. 

Yes: Catania is grittier and more “authentic” and I would say the food scene is better. And the night time is lit up and beautiful and eclectic. It’s fun, it’s the perfect base. But Taormina has charm, gorgeous views, lovely beaches. It’s not a hellhole. If I were to compare, for example, with Oia in Santorini which truly was a whitewashed hellhole of exactly the same manufactured crap over and over, made in PRC, you’d obviously see Taormina is the better choice.

I've got a trip coming up to Taiwan at the end of this month for about 8 days. We'll be starting out in Taipei and planning to do a lot of the common activities and day trips from there (Yangmingshan, Beitou, biking around the city, night markets, Elephant and/or Teapot mountain hikes). 

We want to see another part of the country as well and have landed on Tainan. Currently we're booked for 3 nights there (arrive afternoon day 1, two full days, leave early back to Taipei on day 3). 

I've read that Tainan is all about history and food, and personally I'm not too much into the history when I travel. I'm not disinterested, but I'm not the type of person to prioritize museums or temples just for the educational aspect. I'm more intersted in nature/scenery, food, walking/biking around, local culture. It's very hard to tell if two full days in Tainan is going to be overkill for this and if we should prioritize Taipei time. 

Also we were considering the east coast but spending 5 hours to and from Taitung seemed like a lot of time after the rest of our travel (we'll be in Singapore coming from US first, so a lot of time on planes and traveling). Though biking around that area seems really nice. 

Just trying to find a good way to round out our trip and a bit worried Tainan might be a miss. It seems very polarizing in that many people recommend but then many people say it's boring. For someone like me that wouldn't normally prioritize museums/historical education, is there still enough to fill 2 days that wouldn't be better spent elsewhere?

For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

BOA airlines sucks and is very corrupt (not surprising to anyone who knows Bolivia well). With Bolivia's recent currency volatility, things have gotten a lot worse. Not a lot of options around Bolivia, unfortunately. 

  
**IF FLYING BOA:** 

1. Do not let the airline put priority tags on your luggage (if you are paying for an upgraded seat). All this will do is make your bag a target to be stolen / ransacked when checked 

2. Keep everything valuable with you... Particularly cash (should be obvious but i'll state the obvious)

3. If you are checking a bag, don't lock your luggage. Airline workers will just cut the locks off and ruin your suitcase. Might as well let them search through your things without breaking your suitcase so you don't have to spend a few hundred replacing the luggage they ripped into. BOA will not take any accountability for their employees breaking into your luggage and stealing your belongings.

  
This is not to say Bolivia is not a great country worth visiting. Just note that with the recent currency volatility, things have gotten worse so be extra careful. ",1728315390.0,2024-10-08 10:35:11

All the 5 day itineraries I'm looking at seem to have us bouncing all over the place, but really I would rather focus on the best area for wildlife viewing. I would love to camp somewhere closer to the action so I'm able to get some experiences without things getting too crowded. Ideally I want to focus on a good location, with a good guide.

I realize many great options will likely not be available with such little notice but any recommendations would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",1728338802.0,2024-10-08 10:35:11
t3_1fyjz70,canadian traveling. need travel insurance with pre-existing medical condition (dx within 90 days),"hello all,

i started taking a cholesterol medication about 2 months ago (no other diagnoses). I can't seem to find a company that will cover me for travel insurance. while many have a ""pre-existing medical condition"" rider that you may purchase they require that your condition be ""stable"" for minimum 3 months (stable being that there were no changes).

anyone have suggestions. 

i'm a 46 year old male. going to US (california) as a canadian. I'm most concerned that if I have a heart attack or stroke (or something related) it won't be covered because of the cholesterol med negating the policy. 

please recommend a carrier if you know of one. ",1728338490.0,2024-10-08 10:35:11

We are considering then doing Leticia for the Amazon, but the popular tour is a bit pricey so we haven’t locked it down yet and are looking for potential alternatives. Any suggestions? This leg of the trip would last about 4 days, and we’re traveling by plane in between each destination. We prefer nature spots over cities. Any must-sees? Hidden gems? Authentic experiences? Breathtaking views or fun adventures?

I also want to make sure the teenagers are occupied. A lot of family resorts are geared towards little kids so I want to make sure there is enough for teenagers to do.

We live in Scandinavia so the days in winter are long, dark and cold, especially January. We´re both prone to winter depression, so now that we have the opportunity for a vacation in January, we´re planning on taking it. Indonesia has been an option we have been considering, and we wouldmlove to go there, but it seems as though the rain season is at it´s peak in January in parts of Indonesia. Though the rain itself doesn´t bother us that much, the high humidity does.

For context we would love to stay somewhere that´s not super mainstream or full of resorts. If we find a nice area, we´ll look into the opportunity of renting a nice little place for a couple weeks, somewhere by the coast, somewhere quiet. Preferably not around the biggest cities, but located near a village or something along those lines. We love good food but our budget doesn´t allow us fine dining, but that´s not a problem, somewhere with good local food is more than enough! We would love to stay somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture! We also love to surf and swim (we´re both beginners at surfing though) , but having that oppurtunity is also a big part of the vacation.

To summarize; we would love advice / suggestions on somewhere to go on vacation in south-east Asia that´s not to touristic and not too overflooded with rain and high humidity in January. Preferably somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture, where it´s possible to surf. Any suggestions or general advice is very appreciated! Thank you!!

There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").

t3_1fyfn9k,South America 6 weeks travel itinerary,"Hello Reddit travelers!

We are a couple from Sweden, 30 and 27 years old, planning a 6-week trip through South America starting in January 2024. We’ve already booked our arrival and departure flights, landing in Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd of January and flying home from San José, Costa Rica, on the 18th of February. We love  to explore both cities and nature, but prefer to keep things fairly comfortable, avoiding long hikes and multi-day camping trips. We’ll mostly be flying between countries to save time and exploring various destinations without overloading our schedule. We're looking to stay in private rooms at hostels to stay on budget, but might consider hotels for a few nights in total if they're worth the extra buck. 

We have a route in mind and would love any feedback, especially tips on the must-sees, hidden gems, and general advice on logistics!
 

**--- January 3–13 (10 days) – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

We’re thinking about staying in the Ipanema area, close to Copacabana.
Planning to explore iconic spots like Sugarloaf Mountain, Selarón Steps, Parque Lage, and the beaches of course.
We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe).
Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out.
For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.   


 We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in?
We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?  


 **--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.**

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants.
Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.


**--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco)  – Fly to Cusco, Peru.**

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?  

  
**--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).**

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing?
Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.


**--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.**

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.


**--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.**

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example.
We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? 
We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?


**--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.**

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic.
Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

- 

We’re aiming for a balance between adventure and relaxation while being budget-conscious. Also, if anyone has hostel recommendations with private rooms, please let us know! Thanks in advance!",1728327753.0,2024-10-08 10:35:11

We're looking for recommendations for an eco lodge type experience in mainland Europe for April 2024.

Current Google search is giving either Airbnb (don't want to self cater), Center Parcs type massive places (too big), or hotels. Or lovely little eco lodges that are absolutely not family friendly.

We'd love somewhere in the middle of nature... Little chalet accomodation, tents, sheds that sort of thing... Where you can walk about and be in nature... Trees, ponds, forests and the great outdoors.

t3_1fy9zwm,"Connecting through Miami International on Friday, should I change it?","I'm flying from South America to Chicago via Miami on Friday the 11th, and this hurricane that's brewing has me worried. 

It's not supposed to hit Miami as of right now but that could change. Also Friday is like 2 days after the estimated landfall that's going to be on Wednesday and it should've dissipated by then but I don't know how much.

What worries me is that if the area surrounding the airport floods then they're probably going to close that airport. 

It's very important that I get to Chicago on Friday so I can't move the trip to next week. 

It's going to be me and my wife but we're in separate reservations. Hers is paid with cash and has a strict cancellation policy and mine was with miles and has a flexible cancelation policy. 

I have the option of flying through Houston instead, which will give me a little peace of mind but we would be forfeiting her ticket and losing that money. The thing is that I should make the decision today, bc the price is still kinda reasonable. 

So my options would be, waiting it out and leaving everything as is, but risk my trip getting upended by the hurricane, or losing my wife's ticket money and just changing my ticket and buying a new one for her (but risking that Miami would be unscathed and I spent all that money for nothing)

After five intense years of working Mondays to Sundays building my (successful!) business and taking 0 vacation, I’m craving some well-deserved rest on a beautiful beach, soaking in the sun and gazing at the turquoise ocean.

I’m considering a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands and looking to book either an Airbnb or, more likely, a hotel there. While I will mostly rest, I want to explore the island, visit snorkeling spots, restaurants, bars, and different beaches. My concern is: I don't drive. I don't have a license. I read everywhere than renting a car is essential to move around.

So I'm wondering: Can I simply rely on the cabs? I understand it can be an expensive option, but I’m willing to spend some money. Do cabs go everywhere? Is there a hotel that’s closer to the main attractions?

I'm planning weekend trips mostly so they can rest during the week (I have work, and my parents are in their 60s, so I don't want to overwhelm them).

Here's what I have in mind:

1. **Fall foliage:** Do any states still have fall foliage left by the 3rd week of November? I was thinking of taking them to DC, but I’m open to suggestions.
2. **Niagara Falls:** Is it worth visiting during late November/Thanksgiving weekend? How is the experience around that time?
3. **New York City:** Planning an overnight stay around Christmas/New Year and going to see the Statue of Liberty the next day. Which one would be better
4. 3-4 days trip to California to get them some sun and just relax on the beach.

It was completely undamaged at return and the agent said it was no problem and he tried to reattach it himself but there was a crunch sound and he snapped something. He then said that he would have to send it to the shop so they can re attach it and reassured me that there would be no charges whatsoever. Once again if you note the areas of damage in the report there is nothing that says damage just assessment to the gas lid which in the picture is right next to it. If the gas lid was damaged it was done by the agent. 

I never received an email about the damages and deleted any pictures and videos I had about the car to save storage on my phone.

t3_1fyj80o,Can KLM really trick me into giving them EUR 980,"
All my life I’ve been dreaming of going to Rio de Janeiro. I booked a flight to celebrate finishing my master’s degree. I had to work while studying to afford this trip. I booked a basic fare (EUR 980) by accident and asked customer service if I could upgrade to a student fare (for an extra EUR 110). They told me it was okay. The student fare brings several benefits such as checked-in luggage but most importantly, flexibility. You can reschedule for free and get a refund for EUR 250. So I upgraded. When upgrading I specifically asked if I could get all the benefits from the student ticket. Yes, they said, I specifically asked if I could reschedule for free and if I can reschedule for free and get a refund for the TOTAL price minus the EUR 250 cancellation fee. The lady said yes.

To keep a long story short, my last exam didn’t go as planned and I don’t really know when exactly I can go (this is out of my control). So instead of rebooking the flight for free I decided it’s worth losing the cancellation fee of EUR 250 from my total EUR 1090 and rebook by myself afterwards somewhere in mid-February to mid-March since I didn’t know exactly when I would be able to go.

The issue: I got back EUR 110 and nothing else. I explained to customer support that I was informed the opposite and they simply don’t care. Since I did the upgrade and asked about the cancellation through phone, I expect their guidance and given word to be correct. What can I do?

t3_1fy4rhm,Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

I’ve even seen next-day flights drop in price significantly, which is super frustrating because I’m torn—do I grab something “reasonable” now, only to watch it fall by $200 a week later? Should I wait? Am I just doomed to stress-refreshing flight deals?

I vaguely remember some airlines offering price protection, but I can’t recall which ones (or if that’s even still a thing). Maybe third-party sites like Orbitz offer this? Though, my last experience trying to make a claim with one of those price guarantees felt like battling customer service bosses in an endless loop of “please hold.”

So, what’s the best strategy for dealing with these wildly fluctuating fares? And is there any legit price protection out there? Would love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT:**  I just booked a fare and didn't realize that United now has this ""fare lock"" feature where you can lock the fare for - in this case - 3 days - and then opt to buy or not.

* Is March a better choice due to lower crowds and costs, despite being colder? I’ve heard April might be crowded due to school holidays and Easter. Is the warmer weather worth the extra expense? How about May? Will things be more expensive then?

   * **Valencia (2 days)**

* Should we include Malaga too?

A few days later, the problem is fixed. With a few tweaks, it’s still possible to go on the second half of the vacation. But booking new outbound flights at such notice is very expensive. The cost can be afforded, but not comfortably. 

What would you do?

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip. Hundreds of dollars have been lost on non-refundable flights and accommodation, with nothing to show for it, but at least you’ll effectively reclaim some of it through saved expenditure on meals and attractions whilst out there",1728291985.0,2024-10-08 10:35:12

I really have been on one too many flights where the attendant seemed annoyed because I asked for water. Once was simply told ‘no’. 

Am I doing something wrong or are they just *insert profanity here*? 

Edit: with some vastly differing opinions in the comments, I feel glad knowing that I’m in fact not the *insert profanity here * for not knowing the protocol! 

Also, I must clarify that I was referring to a time that is WELL before landing, that is before the pilot announces “cabin crew prepare for landing”. I’m aware that they can’t help you after. 

Also, we don’t pay for water here :)

Finally, a flight attendant answered my question! I’m so glad to put an end to the debate!

I have have more time available (26 days), than the length of the tour (18 days). So, I have arranged to arrive 4 days earlier and leave 4 days later than the rest of the tour group. In the first 4 days. I am flying to see iguazu falls. Should be cool and fine. So far so good.  
For the last 4 days... December 26-29.. I am contemplating flying to Salta to explore. This would give me  2-1/2 to 3 days there.. leaving out flying time. 

The tour itself will go to the parana' delta area , rocoleta cemetery area, explore one or two neighborhoods in Buenosaires and gives us about half a day that is unstructured and on our own. This doesnt seem like much time to see the city. before we the fly off to Patagonia.   

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool. In the later option I would probably lose a day due to flying.. (the flight is only 2 hours, but to get to airport and out of airport twice etc.. will shoot most of a day.

I also considered taking a ferry to Uruguay and renting a car, but I read that Uruguay is quite sedate.... So.. Uruguay? Buenos Aires more in-depth or Salta?

t3_1fy0s0c,Need advice on my Vietnam itinerary,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are planning a trip to Vietnam from January 30th to February 10th next year. We’ve already booked our tickets, which were a great deal, but I overlooked the fact that our trip coincides with the Tet celebrations. We’re feeling a bit anxious about how the first few days might go, so we’d love some feedback from anyone with more experience in Vietnam during this time.

Here’s our itinerary:

* **January 30:** Arrive at Hanoi airport, then take a private transfer to Tam Coc, Ninh Binh. We should arrive by 4 PM, so we’ll keep it low-key—grab a meal, walk around, and acclimatize after the flight.
* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

We’re wondering if we’ll be able to arrange private transfers during Tet and whether the weather will be warm enough to enjoy the beaches in Da Nang and Hoi An at that time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1728280543.0,2024-10-08 10:35:12

t3_1fy6p82,Krakow Travel Report,"**Arrival:**

My visit to Kraków took place on an overcast few days in early October 2024. I'd set aside three days for the city and a day trip to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. The appeal was the affordability of the trip and a curiosity to visit a Polish city and learn more about Polish culture, the WW2 history at Auschwitz-Birkenau (the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers) was also a factor in the decision to go. Many Poles choose to come to work and live in my country of residence; and I reciprocally desired to gain an understanding of their cultural background.

Alighting at the train station and walking past Barbakan (est. 1498) and through St. Florian's Gate (c. 1307) was an impressive entrance to the city. It was about 10pm at this point and as we walked down Floriańska (St. Florian's Street), I quickly noticed a number of dolled up young women standing in the middle of the street holding black umbrellas in the light rainy drizzle, looking around at bypassers. Was this prostitution or something else? Not the best first impression, but I am aware that soliciting for prostitution is legal in Poland and their laws on the matter are more lax. Sadly, in my opinion this does colour public spaces with a sleazy vibe, I think such activities should be kept out of sight especially in such a thoroughfare not far from the main square. Even at night. I did not notice any police presence monitoring these apparent activities.

**Day 1:**

Fast forward to the next day and we started by walking through part of the charming ‘Planty park’ (a circular park which encompasses the entire Old Town district), noticing an amusing overabundance of park benches. Unfortunately there were no big central parks or highly curated green areas besides this. We then hauled ourselves up a gradual slope to ascend Wawel Hill to the castle and cathedral. This is considered the most culturally important site in Poland. After having a quick stroll around the imposing Italian-style castle courtyard, we chose to enter the (nearly 1,000 year-old) cathedral via the audio-guided tour, which was not too costly. Sadly the cathedral tower was heavily scaffolded which tarnished the view. The audioguide headsets conveniently triggered different audio clips as you walk around the site, which meant you didn't have to key in numbers. Wawel Cathedral is where Polish monarchs were formerly crowned and buried. The monarchy was abolished on 25th November 1795. It's a shame that the Polish monarchy has ended as I find national interest in its own intelligentsia and ruling class to be a showcase of heroism, statecraft, and political leadership through the centuries. Although I acknowledge the valid criticism of the notion of monarchy.

From the outside, the cluster of different architectural additions over the centuries is intriguing to see, particularly the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel (1533) which was beautiful and is considered the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps, dedicated to the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty. It's worth noting that the site was getting quite busy and numerous tour groups were congregating and piling through the cathedral. Because it was a relatively small cathedral, this crowding did feel slightly uncomfortable (but still manageable) at times. There were no photos permitted inside the cathedral. 

We ascended the steep steps of the Royal Sigismund Bell tower which led to the bell at the top and a slightly restricted view over the city through a wire barrier. There was a photo op to touch the bell's clapper, which is considered good luck. Once again it was quite busy in this space owing to the crowds, luckily there was a separate descent staircase available.

We then walked down Wawel Hill into the expansive 13th century town square (Rynek Główny), the so-called ‘biggest medieval square in Europe’ according to some sources, but Charles Square in Prague is actually two times larger FYI. Our first port of call was the free to enter Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) shopping arcade in the middle of the town square, many vendor outlets sold what looked like traditional Polish goods, in particular the amber goods typical of the region and many other figurines, souvenirs, and models. 

After this we entered the grand Brick Gothic St. Mary's Basilica which sadly had a cladding of scaffolding on the main tower due to longterm repairs, meaning ascending the tower was not possible. The interior was beautiful but it was a fairly brief experience after sitting down to soak up all the churchiness. Every hour a bugle player plays a traditional five-note bugle call (hejnał) from the basilica's tallest tower. They often wave down at the crowds below. We popped into the Muzeum Farmacji (Pharmacy Museum), it is a small museum which features a good collection of pharmacy paraphernalia, but I wasn't raving about it after a few rooms full of similar jars and pots. The information and presentation of the museum appeared to have been unchanged for many years.

Walking around Wawel Hill and the town itself, images of the Polish Pope, John Paul II (1920-2005) - born Karol Józef Wojtyła - can be seen in many places, some may even say excessively! I found it quite whimsical seeing so many portraits of JP2, even despite my reservations about the Catholic Church as an institution. You can sometimes see monks walking around the town on their daily commutes.

**Day 2:**

On our second day we hopped on a guided tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. The tour was well organised although the bus itself was fairly cramped. First we stopped at Auschwitz I (Stammlager), known as former administrative and operational centre of the death-camp, and we're given headsets to hear a crystal clear transmission of the guide's voice as we were taken around the site as part of the group tour. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was the more visually striking of the two sites, with the instantly recognisable gatehouse and train tracks. The Birkenau site was even bigger than I'd imagined. The barbed wire fences and guard towers tapered off into the distance, with the site covering 6,000 football pitches of space. Both sites put together were a moving warning about humanity's darkest capabilities, with well-selected and impactful exhibits. Although I could see no central dedicated museum building. We returned to Kraków, getting back at around 7pm before then going to ‘The Black Duck’ restaurant which was very good value and enjoyable (plus points for duck theming), it was hands down the culinary highlight of the trip. Walking back to our accommodation we were solicited by a prostitute, but politely turned down the offer.

**Summary:**

I found Poland quite dour. A number of the eateries we went to nearly all played melancholic music, many of the souvenir shops stock items with an intriguing tearful girl theme, combining this melancholia with a sudden rundown post-communist greyness (and countless graffitied walls) almost immediately outside of Kraków's Old Town district, the hyped up Kazimierz area is no exception to this. Alongside the city's proximity to a major former Nazi death-camp, the experience was somewhat overshadowed by these things. Of course, Poland cannot easily separate itself from this history under Soviet &amp; Nazi occupation and before that being partitioned three times (the Austrian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition) in the late 18th century leading to 123 years of no Polish sovereignty. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed. The identity and nation of the Poles has been under threat for centuries and I think this reflects in the locals' outlook and culture, they are a guarded people fiercely interested in their national identity and faith. This is a nation in the process of regaining its pride and sense of self. The creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, was only founded in 1989, making modern Poland only 35 years old. In 2022, Poland, Greece, and Cyprus had the highest percentage of adults in the EU at risk of depression, with a share of 65 percent. This is a country with many depressed and downhearted people, but Poland is certainly moving through a period of new beginnings.

Another thing to mention is the Cracovian road zebra crossings don't often have traffic lights. So there were a number of times I felt unsafe trusting motorists to spot me and stop to allow me to safely cross the road. With that being said there isn't a lot of traffic around Kraków and locals are encouraged to use the trams.

Tourist attractions around Kraków were okay, it's very church-heavy reflecting the Catholic way of life there. At times I felt the historical museums could have told Poland's national story more narratively and engagingly. I understand there was a golden age for Poland before the partitions and then occupations during the 20th century. This golden age roughly corresponds to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572).

However, I found the Cracovian museums to be more descriptive than narrative in tone, drily listing information rather than arranging it for a modern touristic palette. Because Poland's history is more on the niche side, I'd have hoped for a more comprehensive overview/retelling. The Rynek Underground Museum (under the town square) seemed like a tourist trap displaying a banal arrangement of rocks and pillars. I decided to avoid entry. The same can be said of the former town hall tower, the view is said to be extremely limited.

To justify a trip to Kraków I recommend spending about two days there max. You will enjoy great value for money on food and drink but the tourist sites are nothing out of this world. You should ideally combine the town with a day trip to either the salt mine or Auschwitz-Birkenau, or perhaps to the mountains nearby if you are outdoorsy (the Tatra Mountains and Zakopane, a popular resort town in the foothills of the mountains). I recommend taking in the town slowly, it shouldn't be rushed as you may quickly run out of things to do if you are not careful.

I give Kraków an overall 5.5/10.

**Souvenirs:**

I struggled to find many souvenirs/keepsakes that really caught my eye. I would recommend having a look in the Kraków Cloth Hall and the outlets on the outside of the building, although I felt much of the items for sale were almost identical between the stalls, the variety on offer was unfortunately lacking. 
I recommend checking out Niebieska Kropka Boleslawiec Pottery and the ""Kacper Ryx"" Historical Shop. I purchased a handmade fridge magnet from the latter which was fairly pricey, but had rustic appeal. I also stumbled across the Wawel Castle Souvenir shop (to the left of the courtyard entrance as you enter) and it turned out to be one of the better souvenir shops in Kraków. So do check that out.

**Food:**

None of my travel review should be considered exhaustive, but I highly recommend going to Czarna Kaczka/ Black Duck for authentic Polish cuisine. Try the Borscht (beetroot soup), it's very tasty. Also make sure you have pierogi somewhere during your visit. For breakfast I heartily recommend Milkbar Tomasza and the savoury pancake with spinach and cheese filling.",1728305046.0,2024-10-08 10:35:12

I'm hoping to travel as much as my money will allow. We live in Montreal. My son is off one week in November and one week in April (Easter) so I'm looking for a destination with him. He will be 15 and obsessed with Disney. We have already been to the Florida and California ones. He wants to be an imagineer when he's older. Some ideas: Paris with Disneyland, a Disney cruise from Florida, Greece (he's also into mythology and Percy Jackson). He's not a picky eater which is good for traveling and loves museums. 

My daughter will have the first three weeks of January off. She will be 18 and is very easy going. Not really into museums. She wants to learn how to surf and is super into Asian culture (but Japan is a no no which will be explained later). I was thinking Vietnam, Costa Rica, a cruise, New Zealand, a cruise, etc. We can also do a group thing (Intrepid or G adventures). She will not travel somewhere where she needs an extra vaccine! lol!

At some point during my break I'm planning on going to Japan with my husband. Just the two of us. We aren't sure when, probably October or early March (before blossoms). I think we should add South Korea since it's close.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

I am due to fly in 4 weeks time, but 2 weeks ago, I was informed my flight out of the UK was now going to fly later and therefore my connecting flight to Tokyo would have to be cancelled as I would miss it.

Initially I was offered a flight 24 hours later but I found one with the same airline that flies two hours later and asked if I could get on that one instead. 

Its been 2 weeks and I am still waiting to hear if that is ok, but there are no other flights available. So my question is, if they can't get me on alternative flights, can I claim the cost of the trip through my holiday insurance?

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast. While sometimes we decide a full packed day is worth it, we often like to go out and do something, come back to the hotel and nap/chill, and go back out for the late afternoon/evening. So we're looking for a home base with lots of options for interesting things to do where it's easy to be a bit spontaneous.

t3_1fxgsrz,Should I tweak my New Zealand Itinerary to add 1 night in Hawke's Bay?,"I am planning a return trip to New Zealand's North Island after doing a 2 week trip to the South Island last year. I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

t3_1fxgmu1,Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

t3_1fxbat3,Cairns/Port Douglas vs. Auckland for last big trip from Australia,"My partner and I have lived in Australia a few years and are currently in Hobart. We plan to move back to North America in the next year and are deciding between two options for our final big (expensive) trip - The Great Barrier Reef or New Zealand. 

Due to timing and cost, we can only spend a week, so we’d be limited to just one of the islands in NZ. Timing is in the next two months, which I know isn’t great as we get into rainy season for QLD, but that’s what works for our schedules. I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. ",1728200554.0,2024-10-08 10:35:14

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her. We’ve both been Booking members for almost the exact same amount of time, booked about the same amount (we go back and forth each trip), and are both at the same Genius level as well as the same amount of bookings away from reaching the next level.

Both on iPhones, same IP, same Genius level, about the same past spending.

And yet, she’s getting minor to massive discounts every time and I’m stuck more or less just paying the normal rate…

t3_1fx9got,"Trip to Spain in summer with a baby. Too hot, or good choice?","We're planning a large family trip for mid-July (due to schedules) and will have a 9-month old with us. We are looking at visiting a small beach town that is a train ride from Barcelona (likely Sitges), but have been reading on this sub and others about the extreme heat in Spain in summer. 

So far, we're expecting a minimal itinerary: A walk in town, occasionally grab dinner, visit a beach or two. Because we're a large group, most places that can accommodate us are a drive away, or a good 30-minute walk, from the town centre or beach. So there would be some short distance travel involved with the itinerary. Have already looked at historic weather averages of Sitges and nearby towns, but it's hard to get a sense of what the heat is really like.

Will we run into any issues going out with an infant due to heat at this time of year? What should we be considering?

I'm also a bit of an overthinker at times. Going to Jamaica for a vacation- bringing a few different OTC meds (allergy meds, NSAIDs, Pepto, etc) and I am bringing some Jewelry. Do I need to declare these? I ask because one line on the declaration form is ""Pharmaceuticals, chemicals, narcotics and other illicit drugs or biological substances"" would OTC meds be considered pharmaceuticals? I feel like TUMS and Claritin are pretty far from narcotics, but I can't find anything that elaborates on this. Also, the line ""I have goods exceeding the value of my (our) personal duty-free allowance,"" with the allowance being around $1000 I believe. I'm under the impression that's more about travelers bringing things back to their home countries from a trip, but does that apply for visitors bringing things in that they will leave with? If I bring a laptop or piece of jewelry that is valued over $1000, would that need to be declared?",1728187265.0,2024-10-08 10:35:14

Then flying to Bohol and spending 3 nights there.

After that taking the boat across to Cebu and spend the remaining 4 nights there.

The hotel is asking me to pay the equivalent of 70$ for housecleaning, which is way more than I paid for the room for 2 nights…. 

I obviously don’t want to pay, because blood stains can be washed and the sheets already had some stains (small but still) and I think the price is insane. It’s also not specified anywhere in the room the cost of any of the items if they were to replace them.

My strategy is to go tell them I’m not gonna pay for stains that can be washed and definitely not that much. The main issue is I have my passeport as deposit (I know stupid) so probably I’ll have to pay hopefully I can negotiate.

t3_1fxl3yr,Cairo really doesn't deserve the bad reputation.... ,"As the title says

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

my girlfriend and I are in the last month of our one year world trip and have a hard decision to make.

So far we travelled Argentina/Bolivia/Peru/Chile/Columbia/Mexiko/Japan/South Korea and now are in Laos. Our original plan was to go to north Vietnam (Ha Giang Loop) after Laos and then fly to India for a month and afterwards to the Philippines in December cause we gonna met some friends there.

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

So its basically 

Vietnam/India/Philippines/New Zealand 

vs 

Nepal/India/Philippines/Vietnam or New Zealand

I know this is really about personal preferences but still we would be happy for some input from other travelers. Both North Vietnam and Nepal were affected by the current floods so we are quite unsure about that also. Is is even possible to do the three passes trek that spontaneous ? Also we are travelling with hand luggage and would have to buy/rent a lot of stuff in Nepal.

Thanks !

t3_1fxblxi,How is this Switzerland itinerary for Jan?,"Me and my family will be in Lyon over January and we want to spend a week in Switzerland. It'll be me + partner and 2 kids (6 and 10).

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)",1728201948.0,2024-10-08 10:35:14

We drove through Skopje, with its mix of old-world charm and modern quirks, and ended up camping by Lake Ohrid. The stillness of the lake, surrounded by mountains, had this calming effect—like you were in a different world.

One night, we met a group of Macedonian travelers who invited us to a small village festival. There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them. We nursed the van back to the nearest town, with every downhill stretch feeling like a gamble.

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport?

t3_1fwxabk,Mexico Itinerary,"Traveling to Cancun for a wedding in mid-November and luckily we have an extra week off to travel beforehand! Would appreciate any recommendations or insights regarding a fun itinerary. 

In general we like to move around a lot and see as much as we can during our travels. The wedding will involve several days being at an all-inclusive resort so we'll have some time them to lounge then.

We like unique cultural experiences, walking around cool neighborhoods, good food, and beautiful landscapes. We're not really ""beach people"" per se. 

With our extra week considering:

1) Mexico City - have been before and we loved it

2) Oaxaca - seems like it checks a lot of boxes

3) Tulum - always been on the list 

4) Merida / Chichen Itza

5) Pick a Spot Close to Cancun - Cozumel / Playa del Carmen / Holbox

PS - Seeing the Monarch Butterflies looks like an incredible experience but not sure if we'll be too early in early to mid November. If anyone has any experience doing this in November would love to hear about your experience!

t3_1fwuyzx,3.5 weeks in Spain - any tips?,"Want to go to Spain next year in late September. Once I get it in my head to go somewhere, I need to plan it out on paper so I can stop obsessing over the dates 😆

Thinking we could do something like this...

Option 1:
- Arrive in Barcelona on 19 September - 6 nights 
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 1 night (breaking up the N to S journey)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 3 nights
- Fly home (13 October)

OR

Option 2:
- Arrive in Madrid on 11 September - 1 night to settle in
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 3 nights 
- Barcelona - 6 nights (quicker trip same day rather than having to arrive the night before directly from San Sebastian and lose a night there)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 1 night
- Fly home (6 October)

All domestic travel by train. 

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1. I thought it might feel a bit more relaxing though to have the 3 nights at the end. 

Keen for some feedback on these itineraries and if I'm giving too much or too little time in certain cities. 

The search function here will get a lot of use from me, but any tips or recommendations would be wholeheartedly welcomed! Our first time in Spain. Into the usual stuff: food, vibes, sights, walking aimlessly, local experiences, etc.  ",1728147570.0,2024-10-08 10:35:14

t3_1fw3r80,Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else.

t3_1fx4okn,Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues. Orbitz doesn't even need to admit any error. But they do need to fix it.

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right?

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both?

Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot.

I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.

If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

Both cities are easily accessible by direct train from Madrid and Seville. I can't recommend them more highly!",1728007352.0,2024-10-08 10:35:14

t3_1fwg3ws,I  need travel destination ideas for a memorable trip with my grandparents. My grandfather was just diagnosed with mild Parkinsons. I don't know how long he will be able to travel as that progresses.  ,"**About travelers**:

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. ",1728094584.0,2024-10-08 10:35:14
t3_1fwaiob,Help with last minute beach trip to get our minds off the hurricane ,"We were supposed to go to italy for one month but unfortunately the hurricane hit us (thankfully we are okay!)

I tried to move our italy flight to next week but they would not honor the flight difference in airfare. We did get the flight credit but will have to just take the trip later. We want to still use our vacation time that we have, so looking to still book something to leave next week and with as little stress/planning as possible. Please help!!

My idea is book 1-2 week beach trip, stay in one location that's walkable to beach/town and just relax. 

Criteria:
-great beaches
-cute/nice town that would be walkable 
-safe
-relatively cheap 
-family friendly (we have a 1 year old)
-flight is hopefully direct or not too long (due to 1 year old)

March 2025 is when I'll be done with my grad school program, and as a reward I want to go on a solo travel for up to two weeks. I have several destinations that I have in mind and things I want to do there, and wanted to get estimates on how long it would take me for the stuff I want to do plus anything else you guys might suggest. I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum
* The Scottish highlands, Wales, the Lake District, Cornwall, the Cotswolds

**4. Japan (1.5 weeks?)**

Similiar to UK, I wanted to stay in Toyko initially, But I feel there's so much to explore in Japan. Really want to fit in time to visit an onsen at least for two days, and do stuff between Toyko and Osaka? Full list of things I want to do:

* Eat tons of sushi, ramen, curry, tempura bowls, and even a fugu sashimi
* Visit to Studio Ghibli Museum
* Visit to Tokyo tower
* Shibuya
* Onsen Trip, as I mentioned
* Shopping for some tax-free items cheaper compare to US; Maybe a Gundam Figure build kit or a Gibson Guitar?",1728102282.0,2024-10-08 10:35:15

Has anyone traveled from Canada to any of these places (with PR card in hand + their *weak* national passport)? Are some more relaxed than others? Any tips or things to avoid (besides the usual travel advice)?

Train from NY to Boston (3 nights - day trip to Salem)
Drive from Boston to Vermont - not sure which cities to visit or stay in (6 nights)
Drive back to Boston (1 or 2 nights)
Fly home  

Be as harsh as you like. Ive never been to the US so the itinerary might not work out. Also if you have any suggestions - cutting, adding or replacing cities - please let me know.

t3_1fw7sg0,Did I get scammed? ,"So I recently canceled a hotel reservation with Expedia. I called the hotel and they gave me a number to call: (888) 432-7981.

Seemed legitimate but due to being impacted by hurricane Helene, I couldn’t provide the confirmation code due to no service or WiFi (called via landline). They gave me a different number and gave me a 50% refund.

This week I had signal and wanted to see if I could get the other 50% as it would be helpful considering the hurricanes impact on us. Called the number above and they worked to see what they could do. They offered me credits for the other half and told me that it would be a $99 service fee for this since it was a manual refund. 

I believe I started to be scammed here.

I gave them my credit card info (I don’t think I should have done this looking back), and they sent me an email from: reservations@thebookingconfirmation.com. It was a receipt and information but it looks shady. The charge on my credit card also shows as: airtktservices(followed by a number). 

What really made me think I just got scammed is they said I would have to call a specific number in order to use the credits: +1-844-202-1445.

When I look for the credits on my account, I do not see them, nor do I have anything from Expedia confirming this in the app.

t3_1fw6nft,"I Need Advice With My Travel Itinerary (Beer Trip, Focusing on Belgium) — It's My 1st Time In Europe","Next year, I'll be taking a 22-day solo trip around Europe to celebrate my 40th birthday, starting with **Belgian Beer Weekend and ending with Oktoberfest**. My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi. But if I stay in Vleteren, I'll be able to walk there and back, depending on the distance between the hotel and In De Vrede. What do you think is the best way to proceed here?
2. The following day, Tuesday, I'm going to Florenville to visit Orval, in a journey over 5 hours.  So, would you advise me to leave from Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper, Vleteren or whatever?

If you have any tips on beer stores or beers you like to drink that I could buy, I'd be grateful.  
And I hope you can help me clear up my doubts about my itinerary and help me plan my trip.",1728067678.0,2024-10-08 10:35:15

However this new flight is NOT in partnership with AA. At the confirmation page, I receive the following message (screenshot). When I check in my AA app, I see both flights been included (where the JAL flight doesn’t have a corresponding AA flight number)

t3_1fvzqax,China in July - 15 days itinerary question,"Hello everyone!

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

- Since we don't have any check in luggage, is it possible to just go to the transfer desk and get a boarding pass there? (Note: Thai Lion Air doesn't allow online check in for international flights according to their website)

- If not, do we have to apply for a transit visa just so we can go through immigration and customs and then check in again at the Thai Lion Air counter?

- OR can we just go straight to immigration and customs and they will issue us a transit visa there considering we are not leaving the airport and only getting out of airside so we can check in again?

My current ranking is:

1. Rome
2. Dubai
3. Mexico City

But I'm very open to hearing from anyone who can provide advice.

My considerations

* No budget concerns, price is not a factor
* Rome would be winter, so the weather might not be good? Unsure about this. Plus side is that it will be way less busy and its football season and I love football
* How friendly and open are people in these cities? I've heard Mexico City is great for meeting new people, idk if the same can be said of Rome and Dubai?

If you had to pick one, which would it be?",1728079943.0,2024-10-08 10:35:15

I flew on Turkish Airlines. This was not my first time traveling internationally, but it was the first time with that type of equipment and I was utterly stressed out about it. I purchased the drone specifically for said trip. I made the mistake of going down a Reddit rabbit hole and all it did was make me feel more uneasy about it to the extent that I was ready to leave the drone behind. I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone. I even went through the painstaking process of registering the drone in Greece and I felt even that was a complete waste of my time. Just thought I would share my experience.

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

I went on a work related trip to Sofia (Bulgaria) and I flew home to Lisbon (Portugal) two days ago. After arriving in Lisbon, I wasn’t able to find my bag and realized it had been lost.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

t3_1fv2ci5,2 month train loop of France,"Hi everyone, I am in the beginning stages of planning a 1-2 month trip around France next September entirely by rail. I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille. 

This is a lot, so thank you very much for reading it and any advice you have for me!",1727941007.0,2024-10-08 10:35:15

t3_1fvj3pm,Renting a car in the US as a Canadian and I have some questions.,"I am flying to Vegas next week where I have a whole 12 day trip planned out with my girlfriend. My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out. 

- assuming my flights go without delay, I will arrive at the airport at 10:30pm and my car rental from fox is scheduled to be picked up at 11:30pm. I am worried I didn’t give myself enough time to deal with finding my checked bags and dealing with customs or whatever. Can I just call the place in advance if I’m running late?

- We are scheduled to stay at the Luxor hotel for the first 3 nights but we will only most likely be checking in at like midnight - 1am the first night. Is this worth calling them in advance?

t3_1fvnxm4,Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) Exemptions,"Hi all,

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

I have also emailed the various embassies and consulates but 1) it's Friday and 2) I'm flying out next week and not currently in the UK, so keen to get as much info as I can from as many sources 😅

Although I see this in their local and Regional plans, the reason I ask this is more or less to do with NordVPN. I know Saily was created by NordVPN which you may of heard has had multiple reports this year saying it doesn't work anymore.

I've been recommended to get an eSIM in addition to a VPN for China.

I'm looking at going to go to multiple countries around Asia, China being one. So I have been looking at Asia/Regional plans with good amount of data for good pricing.

I'm looking for one that will allow me to use Whatsapp and/messenger to call family back home (and having both an eSIM and VPN were highly recommended). So I'm wondering if Saily has been working fine for people even if NordVPN isn't?

I'm from Aotearoa (New Zealand) so the idea of a global eSIM is a bit tricky to find at a good price.

I budgeted about 6K total for the trip, is what I have leftover enough to have good food/cool experiences with?

For reference, just booked my flights via Delta and Aer Lingus for about $2500 total round trip for both me and my S/O, coming from Chicago. Booked all of our lodging for about $800 total for 6 nights. We’re staying in East Lothian (East Liston for 2 nights &amp; Haddington 4 nights).

So far as getting around is concerned, we won’t have a car. I’m hoping to rely on both ride share and the trains for travel around the coast (North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady, Musselburgh, Dunbar, etc). Any suggestions on what is most cost effective? Is this a reliable way to get around relatively efficiently? Obviously we’ll plan to do a lot of walking around in each village/area, but getting to each area is my main focus here. Is Uber reliable in that area? Are the trains fairly inexpensive? 

Still looking for cool pubs, restaurants, sights, etc in each of the places I mentioned. Obviously we’ll stumble on some hidden gems just walking around, but any suggestions are much appreciated!

Just fyi, I’d like to exclude Edinburgh for the most part. But I’d love for someone to change my mind! I’ve heard there’s a lot of tourist traps around the city and with that comes more excessive spending which we’re trying to avoid.

I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ?

i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

Sorry for the long post, I welcome all feedback/ suggestions. Any help welcome !

Thanks!",1727972651.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

t3_1fvauvm,4-Day Trip in Late October - Iceland or Tromsø Without a Car? Need Recommendations!,"Hey fellow travelers!

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

Any thoughts or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much!",1727970283.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

2) Gwangju or Gyeongju, still haven’t decided yet

3) Busan

t3_1fvpk0a,"Custom ""Foreign Tourist Driver"" magnet sticker a bad idea?","I will be going to the US and renting a car. It will be the first time for me to drive on the right so I thought of having a custom ""Foreign Tourist Driver"" magnet sticker made and placed on the rear bumper and rear side doors on both sides.

Is this a bad idea? Will it give ideas to opportunistic robbers? My main concern is if I make some mistakes while driving, the sticker would give drivers behind me a hint of caution.

Update: Got it. I think I will use “New Driver” or “Student Driver”. I got the idea for a tourist sticker from a recent practice in Hokkaido, Japan

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting. Again, we are really wanting Colorado but I just worry about the altitude sickness. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! ",1727976775.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

t3_1fvpzkk,Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1727943901.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point).",1727943868.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? ",1727895112.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16
t3_1fuq240,Planning a trip to Ireland / Scotland,"Hi, 
Planning a trip to Ireland / Scotland.  First time to either country but from the YouTube research, I'll probably be back to see more of the scenery lol.

I was planning to rent a car.  

So my questions are this - which country would you do first?  What are some drives or loops that you would recommend to see the scenery in either country?  Is there any self-led audiotours that someone can do for either country? (Ie like guide along tours or action tour guide apps)

Also, how would you recommend traveling between the 2 countries - from my research, it looks like plane or ferry (if I did ferry, it looks like you can catch a bus between belfast-galway which goes from city center to city center via the ferry)

I haven't done European travel since before CoVID but is there Uber/Lyft/(European equivalent) for taxi service?

t3_1fuyq94,Applying for Japanese eVisa on applied PGWP status.,"Earlier this year, my friends (permanent residents of Canada) and I (a recent university graduate with a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) application in process) planned a trip to Japan. We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

PS: We are residents of Whitehorse, Yukon and the closest Japanese Consulate Office we have is either Vancouver or Calgary.

t3_1fvcgne,Anyone else notice that Southwest leaves the seatbelt sign on for basically the whole flight? ,"In the past I’ve almost exclusively flown Southwest but lately for various reasons I’ve flown on several other carriers both within the US and internationally. I’ve noticed other airlines like American, United, BA, and Lufthansa all turn their seatbelt sign off before even reaching cruising altitude. This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence. Anyone else notice this?

Edit: for everyone replying “you should keep it on anyway when seated” I 100% agree with you and do that myself. I’m only talking about getting up to use the restroom, grab something from the overhead bin, etc. ",1727974645.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

t3_1fv2tyc,EU and Schengen travel ban with travel thereafter ,"Hi there. 

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen?

t3_1fun8lm,16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.

t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place",1727805935.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you.",1727936827.0,2024-10-08 10:35:16

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

I am relatively inexperienced in the world of Christmas markets, but looking at flights it seems doable.


Has anyone been to Prague Christmas market before? Is there any better timewise? Are the evenings/nights better than day time? 
Is that essential to the ambience/experience, in which case an overnight is needed?

Or is it doable and worth it if only for a day?

We're debating on doing self-guided highlands roadtrip, renting a car and everything. I typically enjoy this type of planning but am mentally spent, and open to leaving it in the hands of experts. I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

t3_1ftl7an,Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.",1727780037.0,2024-10-08 10:35:17

Recommendations please!,"I'm a 38/F planning a solo trip to Alsace in early December and am trying to figure out my itinerary including where to stay, eat, and the best options for visiting wineries! I'm hoping for some recommendations on how to cut costs where possible and spend more where it counts.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne. Historically I've done semi-private tours but I'd definitely be open to saving money if I can get around by myself either via car or the Kut'Zig - I'm not sure if there are wineries that are easy to access/open to the public or by appointment to someone outside the industry.

I also would love to hit up the Strasbourg Christmas market for maybe an afternoon, but wine, food, and wandering/exploring are higher priorities for this trip vs. more ""touristy"" activities like visiting castles, etc. 

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access. Wherever I stay, I'll mainly be there just to sleep but it's important that it's safe and clean, but would flex for the right experience (again as long as I can make up for added costs elsewhere!)

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days?

t3_1fultwj,Is 1h layover at DUB for separately booked Aer Lingus flights risky?,"Edit: Thanks all for the advice! I ended up booking a flight an hour later (2 h layover) so hopefully it's enough! :)

Hi all! I'm looking to fly from YYZ to DUB and had flexible plans on what I'd do when I get to Europe. I ended up deciding to go to Manchester first to visit a friend with a new baby.

Now my concern is that I'm looking at booking a separate ticket from DUB to MAN since I booked YYZ to DUB already. The only direct flight option the day I fly in would give me an hour layover around 6 am. Both my YYZ to DUB and the DUB to MAN flight would be operated by Aer Lingus though.

Get through customs and there is the exit with 2 options - nothing to declare, and declare. To be safe I head over to the declare side, where the counter area is roped off.

t3_1fucwpf,Boarding pass not assigned at check in (online),"Is it just me or have others noticed that there airlines seem less likely to assign a boarding pass when you do online check in? Seems like I always used to check in online, get my boarding pass, and then show up at the airport ready to go.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass. But that means having to go and line up at the  bag drop line and that can take an hour at least. As I have no bags to drop that makes for a very frustrating experience!

  
Edit: this is flights to/from US, UK, France, Netherlands.

This seems like a new frustration and has happened on BA, Air France and KLM on my last few flights.

Is there a trick I am missing here? Let me know if this is just normal nowadays or or if there's something I am doing wrong.

Dear passenger, 

You have successfully checked in! Please note: We cannot provide you the boarding pass online now, you need to obtain it at the airport.

* Come early to the airport on the day of your flight to make sure you have enough time to obtain your boarding pass.

t3_1fu7qpc,Iberia Missed Connection and Cancelled Flight ,"Hello Everyone, 

Long time lurker and first time poster looking for some guidance please. 

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

t3_1fu4o30,What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible.

When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!!

t3_1ft24dp,"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

t3_1ftt2wn,Is it worth staying in a hostel in Kuala Lumpur?,"Hey all,
I'm kicking off a solo adventure around a few spots in SEA with a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and was wondering if its worth staying in a hostel or if I should just go with a regular hotel. Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

To travelers who have been to KL before, is it worth trying to stay in a hostel or should I just play it safe and start off in a hotel?

Room booked at the Dubai International Hotel at the airport. My checked luggage will be tagged through to the final destination and I will obtain all boarding passes needed when at the origin airport. 

Question: Will I be able leave and return to airport hotel to sleep before my flight? I know I’ll have to clear customs to leave and that is fine.

t3_1fu03t7,Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?",1727819290.0,2024-10-08 10:35:17

t3_1fst66x,"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",1727695522.0,2024-10-08 10:35:17
t3_1fso6rm,12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

However, I'd like to consult your experiences if I should do Tangier-Tarifa or TangierMed-Algeciras.

Besides, I am a bit uncertain about the local transportation between Tarifa and Algeciras. Rome2Rio tells me that there are regular bus routs operated by local transportation company.

I wanted to get any feedback on our high level itinerary. We will be arriving Sunday Oct 13th and travelling by train (Swiss Travel Pass). 

We have a pretty good idea of our daily activities but honestly I've tried to avoid planning TOO much which removes free time for exploring. My girlfriend and I like planning the next day the night before, talking to concierge for local recs, etc. Here is what I have: 

Day 1 (Oct 13): PM - arrive late to Montreux from Geneva, dinner. 

Day 2: AM - Walk to Chillon Castle, boat tour if time/weather line up. 
PM: Lavaux vineyards walk (Cully -Saint Saphorin). Dinner there/Montreux. 

Day 3: Gruyeres - chateau du Gruyeres, HR Giger Museum (we are Alien fans lol), etc. Train back to Montreux/dinner 

Day 4: AM - train to Zermatt 
PM - Stellisee lake weather permitting/Zermatt bopping 

Day 5: AM - Early Gornergrat, Riffelsee, proposal 🥳. Matterhorn glacier if time/weather 
PM: BEAUSite spa. Dinner at Omnia. 

Day 6: AM - train to Wengen. 
PM: Mannlichen-kleine schedegg if weather permits/lauterbrunnen valley option 

Day 7: (all options) Murren North face hiking, gimmewald, Eiger Trail, schilthorn, jungfraujoch

Day 8: see day 7. Mix/match accordingly 

Day 9: AM - lauterbrunnen valley 1 last time. Train to Lucerne. 
PM - bop around Lucerne 

Day 10: Lucerne City exploring. Old village, museums, boating weather permitting, etc. 

Day 11: rigi/pilatus/stoos ridge (still deciding - open to suggestions). 

Day 12: AM: train to Zurich (maybe stop in Zug for lunch??). 
PM: bop around Zurich 

Day 13: Zurich exploring, museums etc. 

Day 14: depart 

Weather may dictate some of these days. Have thought about training to Bern on any rainy days or other locations. We are pretty flexible and enjoy both hiking and city exploring. Have lived in Colorado for many years and understand October hiking will be layers, beanies, gloves. 

Any advice is welcome!! ",1727805720.0,2024-10-08 10:35:17

I’m in a bit of a stressful situation and would appreciate any advice. I’m traveling to the United States soon, and I applied for the ESTA for myself and my family members, including my cousin and uncle. However, their applications were denied because I mistakenly answered a question about their health conditions incorrectly.

I’ve since learned that I can reapply for their ESTA applications after 24 hours, but I’m really anxious about whether this will work out.

	1.	Can I submit new applications for them with the same passport numbers, or will their previous denial affect the new applications?
	2.	How can I ensure that I provide the correct information this time?
	3.	Is there a chance that the system will still show them as “not authorized” when I try to reapply?

Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Something that's important to me is possibly being able to get assistance. I'm autistic, I can take care of myself so it's not a necessity but it'd help a lot. I know the sunflower lanyard is known with KLM but TAP doesn't seem to be trained with it. I'm not sure if it's known with the domestic airlines in Brazil.

I also have some questions about the São Paulo/Rio airports. What's it like having to switch from international to domestic flights? Do I have to check in all over again, is it far away? Is it easy to find English speaking personnel? This is one of my boyfriends' worries since I don't speak PT very well.

I saw I'd possibly have to do a ""self-transfer"" in Lisbon, what is this like? Also, does anyone know if TAPs prices ever lower again? The price recently got raised and hasn't gone down again.

To me the TAP flights seem easier, times are perfect (good layovers too!), but I'm not sure how reliable they are. I read a lot about baggage rules, but I don't mind putting in extra effort to make sure I'm not going over the limits. To be honest, I'd do that no matter the airline.

t3_1ft5pl2,7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)",1727728123.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18
t3_1ftofd9,Reasons not to fly with Iberia/level as per my recent experience,"
- [ ] No free blankets/headphones/pillow. (Normally this was always complimentary)
- [ ] No water???
- [ ] Kicked and rebooked my flight and sent me a bone chilling “we canceled your flight” email
- [ ] Separated me and my family
- [ ] Spent $20 on unlimited WiFi and booted me after 5 minutes. (Flight attendant says there’s nothing that he could do, many reported the same issue)
- [ ] Website didn’t work much for a refund. Never loaded
- [ ] The free WiFi for messaging didn’t work either
- [ ] Breakfast, lunch, and dinner had to be prepurchased. No complimentary meals
- [ ] Screen displays don’t work on my flight to and from destinations (mind you different planes entirely)
- [ ] When I would press help button to get a flight attendant. 1. It took a whopping half hour and 2. When he came by he didn’t ask us what we could be helped with rather he walked straight passed us and turned off the button without a word exchanged. 
- [ ] 5 hour delay to and from. Ended up spending 10 hours at the airport.
- [ ] Check in booths didn’t start until half hour before boarding even with the 5 hour delay. Still had to rush through the whole process

t3_1ftju3z,Travel and tobacco question ,"Hi,

I have a question regarding a recent flight I got
From Hong Kong to Melbourne, Australia. 

I attempted to purchase 100 grams of tobacco from Hong Kong airport, well aware of the 25g limit when entering into Australia. 

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

Sincerely,

Highly anxious Male, 26, currently smoking their cigarettes. ",1727774295.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18

Alternatively, if it's during the day (and it is) and I can travel first class by train (and no need to pre-book - just turn up and get the next train - there's one every hour), then should I be okay?

Arrival: BCN 

Direct flight   A300-200 

  
**My parent's flight to Barcelona**

1. they purchased a ticket months ago. One way ticket.

**Problem** 

1. Cancelation  A day before the flight, the initial flight was canceled, and they got re-assigned to a different flight day later. 

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. ",1727729597.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18

t3_1ft10f6,Mendoza Argentina Recommendations!,"I will be traveling to Argentina this November with my fiance, and we will have 4 full days in Mendoza.  We are debating between two options:

Option # 1: Stay at a vineyard/resort that has a spa and activities like wine tour, horeback riding, etc. all on the resort. More expensive option

  
Option # 2: Stay in a hotel in Mendoza city and take day trips to thermal hot springs, horseback riding, wine tour, etc.

The resort option sounds nice, but I worry about limiting ourselves to the resort itself and not being able to experience some of the more well known restaurants in the city or other activities.

Has anyone traveled to Mendoza before and have any input on whether we should stay in the city and be open to any restaurant/activity we'd like or if it would be better to book one of the resort type options?

  
TL;DR : Should we stay in Mendoza city and take day trips to activities or book an all inclusive resort?

t3_1ft0zrv,Delayed luggage with LOT in Warsaw,"I wondered if anyone here had experience with delayed luggage with LOT. 
I had a flight from Bucharest to London via Warsaw last night. The flight from Bucharest left late and I barely made the connection to London. I suspected my luggage won’t make it though, which became clear once I got to Heathrow and the luggage wasn’t there. I put a claim immediately. Today, I have tried to speak to someone about it, assuming it’s a simple matter of getting the bags on the next flight.
Everyone at LOT has been extremely unhelpful, they tell me to contact a different number every time and all they say is that the bags are being traced. 

It’s soon 24h since I got to London, and I have no idea where the bags are. I was coming back from a long trip with lots of clothes and personal items in there. 

What are the chances of my bags appearing once we’re past 24h? 

What do I do if they don’t show up in 2-3 days? I have travel insurance but I want LOT to pay as they have been so unhelpful about making the connecting flight or trace my stuff. ",1727716585.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18

From the site i am booking it, it is approximately 30€ per person for the dinner at the hotel (idk if its buffet or Á la carte), but I heard that it is not so expensive in restaurants so we should eat in restaurants outside hotel.

t3_1ft00p7,"8 days in Spain, starting and ending in Madrid - is that enough time to visit another city or should I just stick to Madrid and its surrounding towns?","I’m planning some solo travel around a work trip to Madrid next week and I want to use my time effectively. This will be my first time in Spain and I’m currently torn between two options:

1.	Split my time evenly between Madrid and another city - I’m thinking Barcelona, Valencia, or Seville, or even crossing into Porto (though I’ve been there before)
2.	Stay in Madrid for the full week and take day/overnight trips to surrounding towns (Toledo, Sergovia, Salamanca).

My first day off will be next Friday (11/10) and my flight home from Madrid to London is 3pm the next Saturday (19/10). I’ve heard that 8 days is too much time for Madrid but I’m worried that things will be too rushed if I visit a second city but only spend 4 days in each.

Because of the flight schedule, I must start and end the trip in Madrid. I like walking and street photography, and I can speak basic Spanish. I also want to keep costs low so I’ll probably be staying in hostels for the entire trip.

t3_1fszcqk,Do I Need a Transit Visa for a Long Layover in Frankfurt (Over 24 Hours)?,"Hey everyone,

I have two flights booked for my upcoming trip, and I’m trying to figure out if I need a transit visa for Frankfurt. Here are the details:

* **Flight 1**: Cairo to Frankfurt, arriving at 5:25 AM on October 29th.
* **Flight 2**: Frankfurt to Haneda (Japan), departing at 11:30 AM on October 30th.

That’s more than a 24-hour layover in Frankfurt. Both flights are part of a single itinerary/ticket, not two separate tickets.

I have an Egyptain passport.

My final destination is Japan, and I already have a valid Japanese visa. I’ve checked some visa rules, but it’s still unclear whether the long layover means I need a transit visa.

Has anyone had a similar experience, or can someone clarify if a visa is required for this kind of long layover in Germany?

t3_1ft4exz,Is it a good idea to visit Tbilisi as an East Asian family in late Dec? ,"Hi! Me (F23) and my parents (\~60) are looking to go on a trip for the holidays \~Dec 23-Jan 1 and are really curious about Tbilisi/surrounding areas. Thank you for reading over this slightly long post as I would love to hear from locals/people who have visited before. Would love some pretty honest/frank responses if it isn't a good idea to visit, for whatever reason.

* I haven't really seen a lot online about East Asians visiting Tbilisi, so was wondering if there's any air of hostility towards visitors who are Chinese. We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year. We only speak English (and Chinese but obviously won't be helpful in Georgia!)

t3_1fru0rh,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",1727575803.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18
t3_1fswfii,Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia.

My fiance and I have another trip planned in March 2025 (Mexico), so I'm looking at either February or April for when to travel.

Among my friends, we've already done Vegas, Destin, Nashville, Charleston, hometown, and many who have elected to do nothing (multiple elopements and a Covid wedding).

We're into good food and drinks, games (any kind, I've seen them turn a bottle cap into a drinking game), professional (and unprofessional?) sports, beaches, pools, and water activities. Not big clubbers, golfers, or hikers.

Personally, I love to cook, I like a boat and a lake, to visit an art museum, I tend to be nerdier, and my games of preference are card and board game.

Things that have been batted around in conversation: Ireland (too far for the dads), Montreal, Banff, Lake Tahoe, All Inclusive Resort (don't know where), Lakeside Cabin (don't know where), Austin, Chicago. Not sure if those primers help!

t3_1ftfa1m,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",1727755390.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18

We're leaving our 3yo at home with the grandparents and this might be one of our last kid-free trips. I'm torn between wanting to make the most of it and actually relaxing. Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

I have tried several times to contact the CAAZ to get approval and pay the registration fee but have gotten nowhere.

t3_1fst9w7,3 week US road trip ideas,"Hey all, am hoping to get some route suggestions for a 3 week road trip in 2026 from Chicago - New Orleans/Dallas or Kansas City (at a pinch). 

Firstly, I'm travelling with 2 women who insist we take in the bridges of Madison County - I see these are best visited in Spring . Was thinking of doing the Indy 500 as well and also want to try to squeeze in Memphis/New Orleans and either Dallas or Kansas City (probably prefer Dallas?) for the Fifa Football World Cup (games in these cities scheduled around 14-17 June). Would love to make it to the F1 grand prix in Austin, Texas on 21st June but this may be pushing things.

  
Will most likely hire decent size SUV for the trip and stay in bnb's or the like along the way. Not necessarily attracted to big cities - happy to go off the highway to find local gems along the way. 

  
After the 3 week roadie we will be flying to Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon on the way back down under. 1 male and 2 females in our 50's for context.

  
Hope that's not too long winded of me 😊

Feels kinda scummy, shouldn't Expedia cover those type of things? Otherwise I'll need to say in airport for 24 hours on the last day. Which is quite frankly, shitty.

t3_1ft0ar7,"I need some ""comfort"" advice and some ways to up my travel game","I have been travelling a lot the last few years ( 5 cities in canada, Cuba twice, Italy, Portland/San fransisco, Greece, Germany and this coming april, France) and have learned a LOT about efficientcy in packing, my personal travel style and what I need and dont need when I travel.  I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.  Even if I pack clothes for almost every day I am travelling its inevitable you wear something more than once so I figure why even worry about having so much?",1727714886.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18

My mother-in-law went through an extremely difficult divorce and lost her house and will be going to NYC with my wife and I this December and we want to make it the most memorable trip possible (and covering all the costs). 

Although I said no budget, we don’t actually have unlimited money so it would only be one of each archetypal activity (museum, play, fine dining, tour(?)). I just don’t want options excluded automatically on the basis of expense. We’re open to something like spending 50% more on the margin for a 10% better experience. 

I was thinking about one fine dining experience, one live show (broadway?), some local cheaper eats (una pizza napolita), one of the art museums (met) but open to any ideas that aren’t usually circulated on the sub for cost reasons. 

Edit:
Adding some suggestions below that have piqued our interest so its easier to track. 

Day 1:

- Dumbo + Brooklyn Bridge
- 2/3 star dinner ( MIL choice)

Day 2:
- Tea service at plaza hotel (near us)
- Spa day on governors island (or shibui spa TBD)

Day 3:
- Museum (transit in brooklyn or met)
- Lunch / offtime pizza at L’industrie
- Rockettes (2x rec so going with it)

Day 4:
- display windows on 5th ave ahead of opera
- Opera (magic flute)

t3_1fsoc62,Vietnam Itinerary Help (13 Nights),"Hi, we will be in Vietnam 13th-26th October (13 nights), we had an idea on where we wanted to go and how many nights to spend in each but when it comes to actually planning it, I am not sure if we should drop Hoi An so it doesn’t feel rushed. We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)
17th: Overnight train to Ninh Binh
18th: Ninh Binh (arrive in morning from train)
19th: Ninh Binh
20th: Return to Hanoi (for Ha Long next morning)
21st: Ha Long Cruise (overnight) 
22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa
25th: Hanoi
26th: Flight home (evening)

This results in a total 5 nights in Hanoi, 2 nights in Hoi An, 2 nights in Ninh Binh, 1 night in Ha Long, 2 nights in Sapa, and 1 on a train. Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

t3_1fsqxf2,Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!",1727685997.0,2024-10-08 10:35:18

t3_1fsm1qw,Compare Flighty Vs Tripsy,"Hello everyone,

  
I'm an avid traveler. I usually like to keep my flights tracked through apps. I'm not too concerned with tracking hotel stays or car rental stuff, but it's good when I need it. I usually stay at Hilton hotels and use Avis for car rentals. Unless something unusual makes me deviate from either brand, I'm sticking to them. Flights on the other hand, are usually across many airlines. I like to keep a history of my flights too, just to see where I've been, so I do like the passport feature from Flighty.

I recently discovered Tripsy, I like the UI and I like the general itinerary record. I see that there is a flight/visited record feature, so that's a nice feature. This app reminds me of TripIt. I've used TripIt before, I didn't like the UI though. I didn't like the feel of the TripIt app, but I did love their website, which I ended up using far more than the app. One really great feature, although it's a pro feature, is the expense record keeping of Tripsy. It's really nice to see that immediately and not have to do that on the budgeting app.

I could go on and on about both apps. Again, I've used TripIt, I'm favoring Tripsy out of those two. But what are your thoughts of flight/itenarary keeping of both Flighty and Tripsy? Specifically, I'm thinking of getting a pro membership, so which one feels like you're getting your monies worth?

t3_1froz5i,Money comments on having just returned from a trip to the UK.,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks in the UK, mostly touring by train and car. Wonderful trip but I noticed two things I didn't expect.

The UK was expensive! I would rank it right up there with Switzerland. We stayed in three star hotels and B&amp;B's, rated 8.0 or higher on Booking. We paid US$350 per night in London and Edinburgh, US$250 or less in the countryside, breakfast included. Restaurant prices were high too, we paid pound for dollar. Meaning that a pasta dish would cost GBP20, which is US$26. A burger might be GBP16 = US$21. Gasoline cost around US$8.50 per US gallon. Entrance fees for attractions were high, up significantly from the Rick Steve's prices we saw in a four year old book. Like US$40 to see Stonehenge. Museums in London were still free.

British restaurants have caught the tipping disease. They use hand held. point of sale devices for card payments (normal) and the bill almost always included an ""optional service charge"" of 10%. The server would point out that it's optional but there it was, already added into the bill. Incidentally, quite a few restaurants, pubs and deli's are cashless. It was payment by card only. If you go make sure you have a chip card. (Pay toilets in the parks cost 20 pence to use and no longer accept coins. You have to tap your credit card -- chip -- and you're in. It shows up as a 27 cent charge on your CC bill.)

Transportation: The train was expensive too, although we didn't try to book ahead to save money and did walk-up ticket purchases. London to York cost US$94 per person, second class. Car rental was a pleasant surprise. We reserved with Enterprise from the US five months before the trip and were pleased with both the price and the service. And you don't need an Oyster card for the London underground anymore. You can use a chip card in the same way and you get the same fare as with an Oyster card. You just tap in and tap out.

t3_1frdbjj,Brussels is Terrible,"Brussels was... underwhelming 

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels. 

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.  

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert. 

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck. 

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? ",1727526963.0,2024-10-08 10:35:19
t3_1fslll4,Anyone who has an “M” Visa for China…looking for some advice.,"I’ve been seeing mixed things and want to make sure I do not get denied entry to China or anything when I get there.

On the visa application, it asks if you have ever been convicted of a crime in China or any other country. 

I have an underage DUI charge (misdemeanor) from over ten years ago. 

Initially, I was going to check “Yes” and try my best to do the requirements to get a Visa if I don’t outright get rejected right away. 

Then, after talking to multiple people, the advisement is to check “No”. There is no background check to submit, and China cannot check. 

I would be lying on official Chinese documents and I would be afraid of being denied entry at the border even if I had a Visa for whatever reason.

t3_1fsf473,First time in France itinerary. Alsace tour or self planned?,"Hey, after a month-long trip across Poland I'm heading to Paris for an event and took the chance to put together a 2+ week trip.

I'll be spending 1 week in Paris, I'll try to make a day trip to Provins, maybe the Monet Gardens (they say they are more worth than Versailles and I've seen my shares of royal palaces).

Among close destinations I set for 3 nights in Rouen.

Then I'm finishing in Alsace. 3 nights in Strasbourg and 6 nights in Colmar, each day trying to visit the many beautiful surrounding villages. I've checked online and with locals and it seems that public transport is ""fine"" (I can't drive).

But I wonder if it's worth hiring a tour and visit the villages this way... I generally don't like tours though, as an European, I see them as tacky in Europe, and I prefer the freedom of visiting places on my own.

t3_1fsnq7t,Charging US Phones in a Country with 220V Electricity Supply,"I have heard some contradicting opinions. Hoping to get a more clear answer here.

I am travelling to a region where the electricity supply is 220V.

I have a Samsung Galaxy phone. The OEM phone charger is dual voltage 100V - 240V. So no problem there. All I need is a suitable plug adapter so I can plug the OEM charger in their wall socket. 

Then I find a plug adapter on Amazon that has also a built-in USB port in additional to the regular US receptacles. The seller makes it very clear that this is just a plug adapter but not a voltage converter. 

Some people say because the adapter doesn't convert the voltage from 220V to 110V, I should plug your phone into the OEM phone charger (which take either voltage) and then plug the OEM phone charger into the wall socket via the plug adapter.

However, other people say you can skip the OEM phone charger and plug the phone directly into the USB ports using just the USB cord. They claim that even though the adapter isn't a voltage converter but the USB port will only output 5V, so the phone is safe.

Who is correct? Any real life experience?

Another related question:  How about the USB charging ports in the wall plates in the hotels in 220V regions? Is it safe to my US phone directly into these ports?",1727671895.0,2024-10-08 10:35:19
t3_1fsjkpr,Destination indecision - thoughts wanted,"Hoping for some insight! Talking a two week trip at the end of November but can’t decide where. Getting close to being too late.

About me:

Traveling alone, single mid 40s male.

East Coast USA based.

Generally I love big cities but I also lean much more towards relaxing more than adventure. Beaches are ok. Hiking does nothing for me.

Which also means I generally don’t like more than 2 cities. 3 at a push. 1 is even fine if there are a bunch of day trips.

Museums are ok. Love street food and foodie stuff (non gourmet) in general.

Love things like replica markets. Love places like Akihabara.

Love animals so something like a town full of deer or monkeys or seeing elephants etc sounds great.

Pretty tall so long haul is hell unless I get a bulk head seat. This makes flights more expensive for me due to buying upgrades to get those seats.

Safety is huge for me. Hence why Colombia or Brazil or something doesn’t really interest me.

Would enjoy some dates while on vacation. At the very least mingling with locals. I love meeting people from different countries.

Destinations I’m considering most:

Asia:
Usually prefer Asia. 

Have been to Japan 3x already. Over a month in Tokyo, couple weeks in Osaka. Have been to Yokohama, Kyoto, Nara, and Kyoto already. I could spend a year in Tokyo honestly. But also feel like I should go see more places which would be Hiroshima, Nagoya, or Hokkaido next, preference wise. I also am conversational in Japanese and have a friend I might be able to see a couple days there. It also feels like a waste to learn Japanese and then not go to Japan. But it also feels silly on the other hand to only ever go to Japan. Catch-22 I guess. 

Philippines. Beaches! Manila looks chaotic but fun. People seem insanely friendly. Cebu area couple be cool. I’ve kind of been scared off of the infrastructure there but I don’t think that’s a huge deal just sort of an annoyance.

Thailand. 3 messages a day sounds great. Easy metro in Bangkok. My favorite type of food is Thai. Amazing looking old ruins and temples. This was my first plan before I started second guessing myself.

Vietnam maybe. Love the food.

However, SE Asia in general is about 30-35 hours each way which one, is insane (Japan is only around 17) and two, I lose two to three days of vacation to planes and airports. I also don’t sleep almost at all on planes so i might be going days without more than a few hours sleep and lose even more vacation time.


Americas:

Costa Rica. Just seems nice. I don’t know.  But is two weeks here too much?

Europe:

Portugal. Have always wanted to go. Looks great. Affordable.  Great food. Also I have a friend who would come see me for a weekend here which could be fun. 

Spain? So many great cities to see like Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastien, etc.

Italy. Would love to see Tuscany and Rome and Naples. Pompeii is a major bucket list place. Great food. Bucket list in general it’s freaking Italy. The ruins, the museums, the food, the countryside, it all just seems great. Same friend that would meet me for a weekend in Portugal would also be willing to meet for a weekend in Italy. 

But I’ve been hemming and hawing for like six weeks now. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m annoying friends by constantly talking about it and changing my preference even multiple times a day. I just cannot make my mind up. So figured I’d get some advice from people that have done a lot of traveling on here. Or even people that haven’t and just have opinions! I have to make a decision soon or I’m gonna screw up and see nothing but way overpriced flights. I’m already getting close to that I feel like.

Any thoughts or help making a decision or advice on the act of making a travel decision, which never used to be this hard I’m not sure why I’m torturing myself this year, is appreciated!",1727657972.0,2024-10-08 10:35:19

I’ve been working from home for a few years now. When I started working remotely the goal was to travel to different places while also working during the day, then explore on weekends and after work. My current remote job is based out of a hospital in Boston. We are allowed to encrypt our personal laptops but we are told to not use them for long periods of time.. they don’t give us work lap tops, I only have a big monitor which I cannot travel with. I’m curious to know how others may be doing this. I feel like giving us the option to be remote but then not let us have the freedom that comes with it defeats the purpose a little bit!

t3_1fsmw2g,What to do with about three extra weeks in SE Asia?,"I am going to be solo backpacking around SEA from January to April, starting by looping northern Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. I'll be getting back to Bangkok in mid March and then I'll have about 4 weeks before I fly to New Delhi (from wherever I end up at)

I was initially planning to go down to Phuket briefly to check out Khao Sok for a few days and then use Koh Lanta as my base to check out the Thai islands for about 10 days since Phuket just doesn't sound like my thing. Afterwards I would go to Singapore for a few days and then Malaysia for just under 2 weeks.

However, Western Malaysia is supposed to be super wet in April and I've already been to jungles in central America and will in Vietnam and Thailand as well, so I don't know if it will be worth it. I'm also not sure if there will be enough to do without breaking the bank to spend 10 days on Koh Lanta, so I may have anywhere from 8-16 extra days to do something that is a cheap plane ride from Phuket/Singapore/KL.

I'm currently only going to be spending about 7/8 days in Cambodia between Siem Reap + PP and their surroundings, so I could theoretically add some time here. I'm also interested in Bali (less so after hearing about how touristy it is), eastern Malaysia, anywhere I can climb big mountains without having to pay for a guide, nice beaches (preferably with  waves of like 3-6ft, but I'm happy with anything)

t3_1fs9ju6,Visiting Miami from Ireland at the End of October – Any Tips/Suggestions for My 6-Day Itinerary?,"\*\*Dia duit mo chairde!\*\* (That's ""Hello my friends!"" in Irish)

As the title suggests, I will visit your fine city at the end of October. I'm really looking forward to the trip as it will be my first time in Miami, albeit I've been to Florida (Daytona, Tampa and Orlando) when I was younger.

Although there's a small group of us travelling, we each arrive on different days, which has given me plenty of time in advance to draw up a plan of things I'd like to see and do. I've also booked some activities in advance.

If you'd be so kind, I'd like the people of this subreddit to review my itinerary, offer some suggestions of things I should add or remove, provide some general advice about the city and overall, provide some constructive feedback. This trip wasn't cheap, and Miami is a city I've always wanted to see, so I want to ensure it goes as well as possible! The primary reason I'm travelling is to see my favourite NFL team (The Arizona Cardinals) take on your Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.

I've reviewed some tourism posts within this subreddit over the past few months and have also come across some fantastic suggestions from users, so thank you for that!

Below, I'll try and go into as much detail as possible regarding what I plan to do over the six days. Please also forgive me in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors I may have mistyped. I've been reviewing this post for about an hour to make sure it's perfect (This is my third read-through..). Anyway, I hope this post doesn't end up too long, boring or deleted by the Mods. So without further ado, please see below:

# Day 1 - Coral Gables

I arrive at Miami International Airport at 5:30 PM and will have to go through immigration. I hope this doesn't take too long! From there, I plan to take an Uber or Lyft to my accommodation. This should only take about 15-20 minutes according to Google Maps.

Once checked into my hotel in West Flagler, the plan is to take an Uber or Lyft to the Coral Gables area to explore some bars. Clubbing isn't my scene, so dive bars where I can watch sports and talk to people are right up my street. (Is this called a 'Dive bar?')

I'm going to a bar called... ""The Bar"" followed by John Martin's Irish bar. If I have the time, I might go to Tap42 bar. I also think I'll stick to bottles of beer while in Miami, as I don't want to end up a sloppy drunk. I like Miller and Bud Light, which I think most bars in the city provide.

After, It's another Uber/Lyft to Se7as bar, which looks like great fun according to Google. Since I'm Irish, I then plan to visit Duffy's Tavern - which looks like such a chill spot.

And that's about as exciting as Day 1 gets! It will probably be after 7 PM by the time I get to leave the hotel, and I'll probably be tired after travelling by air all day. As for food, I'll eat in one or two of the bars.

# Day 2 -Little Havana and Downtown

If I've time, I'll visit a grocery store to pick up a few snacks. The hotel provides plenty, but I'll still make the visit for a basic shop.

I'll then head to Little Havana (I'll walk if I'm okay for time) as I've booked a Walking Tour which embraces you in Cuban Culture. It also brings you to places where Cuban Cigars are made, Cuban Food and a lesson on some historic Cuban sites. Looking forward to it!

Once this is done. I might stick around the neighbourhood to explore it a little more, but eventually, I need to get to the Downtown (I'll most likely walk) area as I've booked a Cruise from Sunset to darkness. This should last about an hour.

Once done, I'll explore downtown. I've noted that I should visit Over/Under, Mama Tried and The Lost Boy venues for a drink and some food. Thankfully these are located near to each other.

Once tired, it's an Uber/Lyft home.

# Day 3 - Wynwood, Biscayne Bay and Miami vs FSU in Hard Rock

Uber/Lyft again, this time to see the Wynwood walls. I booked a tour for about $15 and it takes about an hour. Looking forward to it! I had considered buying a ticket for the Buggy Tour, but it was $50, maybe it's worth it?

I'll then visit Gramps Bar for a bite to eat and a bottle of beer.

Walk to the Museum of Hip-Hop. I'm a big Hip-Hop fan, so getting to visit this should be great! I haven't bought a ticket yet, I think it's about $15. I'm also considering visiting the Museum of Graffiti. I'm undecided since the walls will already contain plenty of artwork.

Uber/Lyft to Biscayne Bay and visit Flannigans, which I know is a meme on this Subreddit. I think it's the Rib Rolls I have to try. Anyway, I'll watch the NCAAF games while I'm there as it's not too far from Hard Rock Stadium and have a beer or two.

Uber/Lyft to the stadium. I'm banking on this game being a late kickoff, but FSU doesn't look good at all, and the Miami Hurricanes do. I've a feeling it may be a 3:30 PM kickoff which means I'll have to alter my plans for the day entirely. My seat is at Midfield, in the nose bleeds, but close to the front of the section. It's the Hurricanes' sideline, so no sun issues regardless of kick-off time.

I was at the Georgia Tech and FSU game in Dublin, Ireland and purchased an FSU T-shirt. It's Irish branded and has the team's logo, will I be okay wearing this T-shirt or will it cause trouble? I'm hoping it'll be a conversation starter with people on the day. I'm looking forward to seeing the Miami team, the QB Cam Ward has impressed me over the past 2 weeks.

Once the game is done, I'll have to head back to the hotel. This might be an issue of traffic, but I have an early start on Sunday.

# Day 4 - Dolphins vs Cardinals in Hard Rock

It's an Uber/Lyft to the Miami Dolphins Tailgate near the stadium. A friend who lives there has kindly invited us along. This means I'll need to be there from around 10 AM to 10:30 AM.

Meet my buddies at the tailgate, enjoy it and enter the stadium for the game.

Here's the kicker, I'm on the side where the sun beams down. I read so much advice that I shouldn't do this, but I got a great offer on a seat at midfield so close to the field and I'm on the Cardinal sideline. Other options were in Row Z of the Dolphin sideline and cost more money. I am not sitting with my buddies, but that's okay.

After the game, the evening is wide open. I'm going to do whatever my friends want to do, which means probably going to Mid-Beach or South Beach to watch the evening games in a bar. This will be costly, but it's only one evening.

When it's home time, Uber/Lyft of course.

# Day 5 - South, Mid and North Beach, followed by Heat vs Pistons

When I decide to crawl out of bed with probably a hangover, I plan to visit the island. I plan to start from the bottom (South Pointe Park) and walk northwards for the day. Google Maps says this is doable in a few hours, but I have until 7 PM with pit stops here and there, so I'm in no hurry.

Maybe I'll rent a bike to explore South Pointe Park?

So, I've drawn up a list of sights I should see along the way on my walk, starting south and moving north, please see below:

1. South Pointe Park
2. Visit Ted's Hideaway
3. Miami Beach Boardwalk
4. Ocean Drive and Art Deco
5. Flamingo/Hummus
6. Mac's Club Deuce
7. Espanola Way
8. The Abbey Bar
9. Collins Avenue
10. Holocaust Memorial
11. Sunset Harbour (Maybe?)
12. Lost Weekend Bar (Maybe?)

Once that is all said and done, it's an Uber/Lyft to the Kaseya Arena for the Miami Heat and Detroit Pistons game. I'm sat pretty high up and far back, but hopefully I enjoy the game. Basketball is a sport I loved when I was younger, I even supported the Heat because Dwayne Wade was my favourite player, so it's a pleasure to get to see the team, live!

After that, it's home to bed.

# Day 6 - Advice Needed, No plans made as of yet

I'm considering either travelling to Fort Lauderdale or to the Miami Everglades, but honestly I am totally undecided. I'm open to any other suggestions from you locals, as well!

The Everglades was my original plan, but 2 people have told me it wasn't that good. I'd be doing the typical tourist thing - boat ride, a wildlife show etc.

Fort Lauderdale looks fabulous from the pictures I've seen online. I will have to travel there by train, though. When there, I think I'll do a cruise which lasts an hour or two.

# Day 7 - Hop on/Hop off Bus Tour, Airport and Home to Ireland

I've decided on going with the bus tour so I can take in the sights one final time and stop off at some places which I never got to see over the 6 days. I'm lucky that my bag will be stored away somewhere safe, so I won't need to worry about it until it's time to go to the airport.

My flight is at 10PM, so I have the entire day to see everything one final time.

# Other things I feel I should add

I've stumbled upon a list (Sorry, I've saved this post as a draft twice now) I curated with questions I'd like to ask locals. Please see below:

* What food should I get in Flannigan's? Rib Rolls or something else?
* I'm not a big beach guy, meaning I won't be going swimming. However, I will of course take a trip to the beach for the sights, to take photographs and all that.

I want a trip that will involve being in nature, taking a car and travelling distances, occasionally visiting cities and staying there, but mainly being on the road and remote. Europe in winter is cold, rainy and very wet, but at the moment this is the continent I can visit, therefore I was hoping to get your advice on places that one can go to, and manage around the cold and generally gloomy weather. 

  
I was thinking of Scotland and Ireland, but I am afraid it could be too off-season. I am honestly open to other suggestions, I just wish someone with some experience could let me know if road trips are feasible and enjoyable in Europe around wintertime and if so, where?

t3_1fs51lk,1 week in Peru: MP and Manu NP? Budget-friendly trip,"Husband and I have one week in Peru. I'll be in Tambopata for work for a week, and then we're meeting in Cusco and have a week together. We wanted to see Machu Picchu and Manu National Park (since I'll already have been in Tambopata region and he really wants to see the Amazon.)

We will meet at Cusco airport around 15:00 on 9 November, and then we have a flight back to Lima at 18:45 on 16 November (to then depart back to the US). Neither of us will be checking any bags; just carry-on size (\~40L) backpacks.

Some folks from my work thing are booking a Cusco - MP - Cusco all in one day tour, but at $400 USD pp, it felt pretty steep to us. I'm hoping to put together a more budget-friendly plan.

Does it make sense to:

* Book ahead and take the 16:30 Bus + Train from Wanchaq to Aguascalientes (""Machu Picchu station"") on 9 November ($52pp)

* Book a ho(s)tel in AC for 9 Nov
* Try and find a guide in AC on the day, to take us up to MP on Circuit 2 on 10 November
* Book transit ahead and go back to Cusco on 10 November
* Book accommodation in Cusco for 10 November
* Try and find a tour, in Cusco, on 11 November to take us to Manu, likely leaving in the early AM 12 November and returning 15 November?

Any recommendations on tour companies for Manu?

The last one is notable for being about $200 cheaper pp than most of the rest of them, which is great but also curious...

Is it feasible to see MP and Manu in one trip?

Are we missing something critical if we only do those two, if we only have a week?

t3_1fsd0za,Transfer time for LAX,"Hello,

In a few months, I will be flying internationally for the first time. On December 28th, I will be flying out of SMF and into LAX with my brother via Southwest to transfer to terminal 7 and leave LAX on my international flight.

My SMF -&gt; LAX Flight is scheduled to be from 6:45AM to 8:20AM, to which then my second flight leaves at 11:30AM. These two flights are booked on separate tickets, and in every other connection I have more than enough time to transfer without any worry (the LAX to SMF return flight has a 6+ hour layover).

I'm aware that the terminal I would be arriving in LAX at, Southwest, is at the opposite side of where the United terminal lies, and that I additionally will need to collect and recheck baggage in my 3 hour window. Regardless, is this enough time to make it to my flight?

If I estimate that the flight is \~40 minutes delayed (meaning I am off the plane around 9AM), baggage collection takes \~30 minutes, and we take the \~15 minute walk outside of the airport to cross straight from Southwest to the United terminal (Both my brother and I are able to walk pretty quickly, there's no concern over exhaustion or anything), that would get us depositing luggage around 10AM (+15 minutes accounting for anything else). Then, we would have to get through security and be at the terminal within the remaining time.

I understand that this is a pretty optimistic timeline, and it should also be considered both that this will be early/late morning as well as extremely close to New Years where travel is likely going to be more frequent. With all that in mind, how risky is this decision? This is the earliest direct flight to LAX from SMF we could get.

t3_jj0cli,American Food Made Me Sick When I Returned From Overseas,"Tl;dr After living abroad for many years I noticed when returning to America the food made me sick. Anyone with a similar experience? 

This happened to me twice over the course of 10 years. When I was 20 years old (2010) I moved to South Korea via orders from the US Army. The food there was definitely fresher. When you went out to eat food was freshly prepared. I felt healthier when I lived there. A large soda was like a 12oz cup. Portions were better controlled. I lived there for two years before returning to the US. When I came back I felt it in my gut immediately. Everything I ate would give me digestive issues. I’d frequent the Asian store to grab some foods I was familiar with and for the fresh kimchi. It took me months before I was use to some of the American food again. 

Flash forward to 2016, I received orders via the US army again, this time to Germany. I lived in Germany for three years. The food by far was some of the freshest I ever tasted. The milk especially. I’ve always loved milk, but after having German milk...I mean it’s the best. I had a local butcher in the village I lived in. They cut fresh meat daily, and a grocery store with fresh vegetables. I’m sure in larger cities there is more of an abundance of processed foods, but I lived in a smaller village. Anyways, I moved back to America in 2019. Ever since, everything makes me sick. I can taste like a chemical taste on some of the bread and meat products. This taste makes me not want to eat anything. I didn’t have it when I came back from South Korea. I’m not sure why now? It’s been a year since I’ve been back, and I don’t get as sick as I use to. I still get sick over the food though, and the taste thing is still prevalent. 

My question is: Has anyone had a similar experience to this?",1603802438.0,2024-10-08 10:35:19

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much).

t3_1fz20ls,Denied Boarding Despite Meeting Transit Requirements,"I recently had a flight from Iceland to Singapore with Qatar Airways, with a layover in both London (Heathrow) and Doha. I have an Indian passport with a valid U.S. visa, and according to both Heathrow's website and the UK government's official website, I didn’t need a transit visa as I wasn’t required to go through UK immigration.

However, despite meeting all the requirements, Qatar Airways denied me boarding in Iceland. This forced me to book a last-minute one-way ticket, which was far more expensive and inconvenient.

Has anyone experienced a similar issue? Who should I approach for compensation—Qatar Airways or any other regulatory body? Also, would EU261 apply here, since the flight originated from Iceland? Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated!

I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience. I am a Ukrainian citizen with a residence permit in the EU.

Recently, while traveling, I accidentally spilled water on my biometric passport. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be heavily affected; the appearance and 99% of the stamps look just like before.

However, I’m concerned about the biometric NFC chip embedded in the passport’s cover. I wasn’t even aware of its existence before. Now that I’ve read about it, I found an app called ReadID and tried to scan the chip — but it’s not being detected :(

For instance, my friend’s passport scans without any issues.

My question is: how critical is this problem? Could it affect border crossings, opening bank accounts, or any other procedures where the passport is required? Does this make the passport invalid? Or is there a chance that official institutions have different devices that might be able to read the chip, even if my phone can’t?

Thank you very much in advance for your reply.

(I cannot replace the passport at the moment since I would need to go to Ukraine for that, and right now that would mean being automatically drafted into the war. Although I haven’t lived there for over 10 years.)",1728376480.0,2024-10-08 12:04:37

We will be there for just over 3 weeks, which hopefully gives us enough time to explore 2-3 regions and have a good variety of experiences (cities, beaches, etc.). This is our high-level itinerary so far:

**Days 1-5: Mexico City**

* Including day trip to Teotihuacán

**Days 5-8: Bacalar** (fly to Chetumal from Mexico City, then bus to Bacalar)

**Days 8-11: Valladodid** (ADO bus from Bacalar)

* Including day trips to Chichén Itzá/Rosalia Chay Chuc/cenotes)

**Days 11-14: Merida** (ADO bus from Valladodid)

* Including day trips to Uxmal/Ek-Balam/cenotes

**Days 14-17: Oaxaca City** (fly from Merida)

* Including day trips to a mezcalería/Monte Albán/Hierve el Agua/Pueblos Mancomunados

**Days 17-21: Puerto Escondido** (ADO bus from Oaxaca)

* Including day trips to Mazunte/Zipolite/Chacahua National Park

**Days 21-23: Mexico City**

Have done quite a lot of research but wanted to check with those in the know if this itinerary makes sense or if we've missed anything! Some specific notes/questions:

* We've booked flights in and out of Mexico City (from Europe), besides that pretty open so far
* Have already cut a few places out (e.g. Puebla/Cholula) so the trip feels relaxing, but is this still too much? Or anything amazing missing?
* Don't plan to hire a car - happy to do it, but it doesn't seem necessary for the places we're visiting?
* We like exploring cities and walking (museums, markets, etc.), LOVE food and drink, and appreciate natural beauty
* Want some beach time but not into all-inclusive resorts/sleepy towns with nothing else to do - so thought Puerto Escondido/Bacalar were good options (aware Bacalar is not a beach, but think it counts as lazing by the water vibes)
* For beach we also considered Holbox (but were put off by bad reviews of sewage problems/flooding, power outages, mosquitoes, bad service, etc.) and Isla Mujeres/Cozumel (but hear they are too touristy/similar to Cancun/Tulum) - any other perspectives on this?
* Neither of us are particularly into archaeology/visiting ruins - does this mean we have too much time in Merida/Valladolid? Thinking we might just visit 1 or 2 of Chichén Itzá/Uxmal/Ek Balam and not all of them (similarly with the cenotes)
* We also briefly considered doing Jalisco (Guadalajara, Tequila, Puerto Vallarta, etc.) instead of Yucatan

We have a limited time in the region but want to make sure we are seeing most of what I’ve listed below while not pushing it with so much time spent in the car.

t3_1fyfmr8,Trying to round out my Taiwan itinerary,"Hi all,

I've got a trip coming up to Taiwan at the end of this month for about 8 days. We'll be starting out in Taipei and planning to do a lot of the common activities and day trips from there (Yangmingshan, Beitou, biking around the city, night markets, Elephant and/or Teapot mountain hikes). 

We want to see another part of the country as well and have landed on Tainan. Currently we're booked for 3 nights there (arrive afternoon day 1, two full days, leave early back to Taipei on day 3). 

I've read that Tainan is all about history and food, and personally I'm not too much into the history when I travel. I'm not disinterested, but I'm not the type of person to prioritize museums or temples just for the educational aspect. I'm more intersted in nature/scenery, food, walking/biking around, local culture. It's very hard to tell if two full days in Tainan is going to be overkill for this and if we should prioritize Taipei time. 

Also we were considering the east coast but spending 5 hours to and from Taitung seemed like a lot of time after the rest of our travel (we'll be in Singapore coming from US first, so a lot of time on planes and traveling). Though biking around that area seems really nice. 

Just trying to find a good way to round out our trip and a bit worried Tainan might be a miss. It seems very polarizing in that many people recommend but then many people say it's boring. For someone like me that wouldn't normally prioritize museums/historical education, is there still enough to fill 2 days that wouldn't be better spent elsewhere?

t3_1fy2dpd,The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

Edit: added an image showing the label on the hotel’s page.

BOA airlines sucks and is very corrupt (not surprising to anyone who knows Bolivia well). With Bolivia's recent currency volatility, things have gotten a lot worse. Not a lot of options around Bolivia, unfortunately. 

  
**IF FLYING BOA:** 

1. Do not let the airline put priority tags on your luggage (if you are paying for an upgraded seat). All this will do is make your bag a target to be stolen / ransacked when checked 

2. Keep everything valuable with you... Particularly cash (should be obvious but i'll state the obvious)

3. If you are checking a bag, don't lock your luggage. Airline workers will just cut the locks off and ruin your suitcase. Might as well let them search through your things without breaking your suitcase so you don't have to spend a few hundred replacing the luggage they ripped into. BOA will not take any accountability for their employees breaking into your luggage and stealing your belongings.

  
This is not to say Bolivia is not a great country worth visiting. Just note that with the recent currency volatility, things have gotten worse so be extra careful. ",1728315390.0,2024-10-08 12:04:37

Excellent food, historical sites, and scenery. The market there at the moment is currently very focused on the domestic market, which makes sense when there is such huge domestic demand and a lack of English proficiency. As population decline hits China and it becomes more willing to accept foreign tourists, I presume it could become a huge market. Sichuan, Tibet, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhangjiajie have huge draws.

This is more of a fantasy of mine, that likely won't come true as it's so far away from Europe and Asia, but Chile has incredible tourism potential. Patagonia, cruises, vineyards, and great food.",1728239828.0,2024-10-08 12:04:37

t3_1fyghkm,Which places in South-East Asia is enjoyable in January?,"Me and my boyfriend are planning on taking a vacation in January to somewhere warm, and would love some advice/ insight/ suggestions! We live in Scandinavia so the days in winter are long, dark and cold, especially January. We´re both prone to winter depression, so now that we have the opportunity for a vacation in January, we´re planning on taking it. Indonesia has been an option we have been considering, and we wouldmlove to go there, but it seems as though the rain season is at it´s peak in January in parts of Indonesia. Though the rain itself doesn´t bother us that much, the high humidity does.

For context we would love to stay somewhere that´s not super mainstream or full of resorts. If we find a nice area, we´ll look into the opportunity of renting a nice little place for a couple weeks, somewhere by the coast, somewhere quiet. Preferably not around the biggest cities, but located near a village or something along those lines. We love good food but our budget doesn´t allow us fine dining, but that´s not a problem, somewhere with good local food is more than enough! We would love to stay somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture! We also love to surf and swim (we´re both beginners at surfing though) , but having that oppurtunity is also a big part of the vacation.

To summarize; we would love advice / suggestions on somewhere to go on vacation in south-east Asia that´s not to touristic and not too overflooded with rain and high humidity in January. Preferably somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture, where it´s possible to surf. Any suggestions or general advice is very appreciated! Thank you!!

My first purely personal (i.e. not for business) trip internationally.
I loved every single minute of it. From the food to the people, I couldn't make a single complaint. 
There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").

t3_1fyfn9k,South America 6 weeks travel itinerary,"Hello Reddit travelers!

We are a couple from Sweden, 30 and 27 years old, planning a 6-week trip through South America starting in January 2024. We’ve already booked our arrival and departure flights, landing in Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd of January and flying home from San José, Costa Rica, on the 18th of February. We love  to explore both cities and nature, but prefer to keep things fairly comfortable, avoiding long hikes and multi-day camping trips. We’ll mostly be flying between countries to save time and exploring various destinations without overloading our schedule. We're looking to stay in private rooms at hostels to stay on budget, but might consider hotels for a few nights in total if they're worth the extra buck. 

We have a route in mind and would love any feedback, especially tips on the must-sees, hidden gems, and general advice on logistics!
 

**--- January 3–13 (10 days) – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

We’re thinking about staying in the Ipanema area, close to Copacabana.
Planning to explore iconic spots like Sugarloaf Mountain, Selarón Steps, Parque Lage, and the beaches of course.
We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe).
Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out.
For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.   


 We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in?
We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?  


 **--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.**

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants.
Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.


**--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco)  – Fly to Cusco, Peru.**

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?  

  
**--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).**

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing?
Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.


**--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.**

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.


**--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.**

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example.
We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? 
We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?


**--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.**

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic.
Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

We’re aiming for a balance between adventure and relaxation while being budget-conscious. Also, if anyone has hostel recommendations with private rooms, please let us know! Thanks in advance!",1728327753.0,2024-10-08 12:04:37

We're looking for recommendations for an eco lodge type experience in mainland Europe for April 2024.

Current Google search is giving either Airbnb (don't want to self cater), Center Parcs type massive places (too big), or hotels. Or lovely little eco lodges that are absolutely not family friendly.

We'd love somewhere in the middle of nature... Little chalet accomodation, tents, sheds that sort of thing... Where you can walk about and be in nature... Trees, ponds, forests and the great outdoors. Small and family run is more our bag and family friendly is a must (absolutely minimum a playground or similar on site), as is a restaurant (I don't want to self cater). Would be great if there were activities on site or within an easy drive.

We're not really fussed about facilities so long as the place is clean and the food is good (previous holidays have been spent in sheds...)... Having said that, budget can go up to £4k for a week, so we can do high end if it's good enough.  ",1728316618.0,2024-10-08 12:04:38
t3_1fy9zwm,"Connecting through Miami International on Friday, should I change it?","I'm flying from South America to Chicago via Miami on Friday the 11th, and this hurricane that's brewing has me worried. 

It's not supposed to hit Miami as of right now but that could change. Also Friday is like 2 days after the estimated landfall that's going to be on Wednesday and it should've dissipated by then but I don't know how much.

What worries me is that if the area surrounding the airport floods then they're probably going to close that airport. 

It's very important that I get to Chicago on Friday so I can't move the trip to next week. 

It's going to be me and my wife but we're in separate reservations. Hers is paid with cash and has a strict cancellation policy and mine was with miles and has a flexible cancelation policy. 

I have the option of flying through Houston instead, which will give me a little peace of mind but we would be forfeiting her ticket and losing that money. The thing is that I should make the decision today, bc the price is still kinda reasonable. 

So my options would be, waiting it out and leaving everything as is, but risk my trip getting upended by the hurricane, or losing my wife's ticket money and just changing my ticket and buying a new one for her (but risking that Miami would be unscathed and I spent all that money for nothing)

After five intense years of working Mondays to Sundays building my (successful!) business and taking 0 vacation, I’m craving some well-deserved rest on a beautiful beach, soaking in the sun and gazing at the turquoise ocean.

I’m considering a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands and looking to book either an Airbnb or, more likely, a hotel there. While I will mostly rest, I want to explore the island, visit snorkeling spots, restaurants, bars, and different beaches. My concern is: I don't drive. I don't have a license. I read everywhere than renting a car is essential to move around.

So I'm wondering: Can I simply rely on the cabs? I understand it can be an expensive option, but I’m willing to spend some money. Do cabs go everywhere? Is there a hotel that’s closer to the main attractions?

I'm planning weekend trips mostly so they can rest during the week (I have work, and my parents are in their 60s, so I don't want to overwhelm them).

Here's what I have in mind:

1. **Fall foliage:** Do any states still have fall foliage left by the 3rd week of November? I was thinking of taking them to DC, but I’m open to suggestions.
2. **Niagara Falls:** Is it worth visiting during late November/Thanksgiving weekend? How is the experience around that time?
3. **New York City:** Planning an overnight stay around Christmas/New Year and going to see the Statue of Liberty the next day. Which one would be better
4. 3-4 days trip to California to get them some sun and just relax on the beach.

We’ve found this company Florida Car Hire For Less (https://floridacarhireforless.co.uk), which was also recommended on the UK Orlando Facebook page but it doesn’t mention CDW and a full tank paid for on arrival? The price is £509 for us instead the current rough price of £847.

t3_1fya1r4,Hertz is trying to charge me for damage to the car pls give me advice ,"We returned the car with no damages and the agent that checked our car verbally stated that there were no damages. The gas lid that is on the outside of the car with the paint fell off on the first refueling of the car when I tried to open it by pushing and it just came off with my hand. It was completely undamaged at return and the agent said it was no problem and he tried to reattach it himself but there was a crunch sound and he snapped something. He then said that he would have to send it to the shop so they can re attach it and reassured me that there would be no charges whatsoever. Once again if you note the areas of damage in the report there is nothing that says damage just assessment to the gas lid which in the picture is right next to it. If the gas lid was damaged it was done by the agent. 

I never received an email about the damages and deleted any pictures and videos I had about the car to save storage on my phone. I only received a letter which I didn’t see until I returned from travels. It is wrong that I was not sent an email as soon as this was billed and only got a physical mail that I didn’t see for another month. 

there has to be security camera footage of my return date at the time that I signed the document showing that I explained it to the agent and that he himself tried to reattach it and damaged it right? He was reassuring me that no fees would be charged and no damage was done and that they just needed to reattach it. 

The agent verbally lied to me if there are fees I have to pay and it is not right. I’m trying to dispute it any advice? They are trying to get me to pay for the total replacement of the gas lid ",1728313968.0,2024-10-08 12:04:38

Urgent help needed - due to fly out tonight with BA from LHR,"According to the UAE or foreign affairs, to travel to the UAE 'Passports must be valid for at least 6 months from the 'date of entry' into the UAE, however my passport expires whilst I'm out there (a day before to be exact).

I can either cut my holiday short by a day that would mean I can travel back before the '6 month expiry period' or if the rule doesn't apply on leaving dubai then I might be okay. I won't know until I get to the airport and will have to take that chance.

t3_1fyj80o,Can KLM really trick me into giving them EUR 980,"
All my life I’ve been dreaming of going to Rio de Janeiro. I booked a flight to celebrate finishing my master’s degree. I had to work while studying to afford this trip. I booked a basic fare (EUR 980) by accident and asked customer service if I could upgrade to a student fare (for an extra EUR 110). They told me it was okay. The student fare brings several benefits such as checked-in luggage but most importantly, flexibility. You can reschedule for free and get a refund for EUR 250. So I upgraded. When upgrading I specifically asked if I could get all the benefits from the student ticket. Yes, they said, I specifically asked if I could reschedule for free and if I can reschedule for free and get a refund for the TOTAL price minus the EUR 250 cancellation fee. The lady said yes.

To keep a long story short, my last exam didn’t go as planned and I don’t really know when exactly I can go (this is out of my control). So instead of rebooking the flight for free I decided it’s worth losing the cancellation fee of EUR 250 from my total EUR 1090 and rebook by myself afterwards somewhere in mid-February to mid-March since I didn’t know exactly when I would be able to go.

The issue: I got back EUR 110 and nothing else. I explained to customer support that I was informed the opposite and they simply don’t care. Since I did the upgrade and asked about the cancellation through phone, I expect their guidance and given word to be correct. What can I do?

t3_1fy4rhm,Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

I’ve even seen next-day flights drop in price significantly, which is super frustrating because I’m torn—do I grab something “reasonable” now, only to watch it fall by $200 a week later? Should I wait? Am I just doomed to stress-refreshing flight deals?

I vaguely remember some airlines offering price protection, but I can’t recall which ones (or if that’s even still a thing). Maybe third-party sites like Orbitz offer this? Though, my last experience trying to make a claim with one of those price guarantees felt like battling customer service bosses in an endless loop of “please hold.”

So, what’s the best strategy for dealing with these wildly fluctuating fares? And is there any legit price protection out there? Would love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT:**  I just booked a fare and didn't realize that United now has this ""fare lock"" feature where you can lock the fare for - in this case - 3 days - and then opt to buy or not.

**Itinerary:** 

* We’re planning to visit:
   * **Madrid (4 days)**
   * **Granada (2 days)**
   * **Seville (3 days)**
   * **Valencia (2 days)**

**Day Trips:**

* How about day trips to Toledo and Córdoba? Are they worth the time?
* Should we include Malaga too?

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip.

Also, I must clarify that I was referring to a time that is WELL before landing, that is before the pilot announces “cabin crew prepare for landing”. I’m aware that they can’t help you after. 

Also, we don’t pay for water here :)

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool.

* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

My visit to Kraków took place on an overcast few days in early October 2024. I'd set aside three days for the city and a day trip to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. The appeal was the affordability of the trip and a curiosity to visit a Polish city and learn more about Polish culture, the WW2 history at Auschwitz-Birkenau (the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers) was also a factor in the decision to go. Many Poles choose to come to work and live in my country of residence; and I reciprocally desired to gain an understanding of their cultural background.

Alighting at the train station and walking past Barbakan (est. 1498) and through St. Florian's Gate (c. 1307) was an impressive entrance to the city. It was about 10pm at this point and as we walked down Floriańska (St. Florian's Street), I quickly noticed a number of dolled up young women standing in the middle of the street holding black umbrellas in the light rainy drizzle, looking around at bypassers. Was this prostitution or something else? Not the best first impression, but I am aware that soliciting for prostitution is legal in Poland and their laws on the matter are more lax. Sadly, in my opinion this does colour public spaces with a sleazy vibe, I think such activities should be kept out of sight especially in such a thoroughfare not far from the main square. Even at night. I did not notice any police presence monitoring these apparent activities.

**Day 1:**

Fast forward to the next day and we started by walking through part of the charming ‘Planty park’ (a circular park which encompasses the entire Old Town district), noticing an amusing overabundance of park benches. Unfortunately there were no big central parks or highly curated green areas besides this. We then hauled ourselves up a gradual slope to ascend Wawel Hill to the castle and cathedral. This is considered the most culturally important site in Poland. After having a quick stroll around the imposing Italian-style castle courtyard, we chose to enter the (nearly 1,000 year-old) cathedral via the audio-guided tour, which was not too costly. Sadly the cathedral tower was heavily scaffolded which tarnished the view. The audioguide headsets conveniently triggered different audio clips as you walk around the site, which meant you didn't have to key in numbers. Wawel Cathedral is where Polish monarchs were formerly crowned and buried. The monarchy was abolished on 25th November 1795. It's a shame that the Polish monarchy has ended as I find national interest in its own intelligentsia and ruling class to be a showcase of heroism, statecraft, and political leadership through the centuries. Although I acknowledge the valid criticism of the notion of monarchy.

From the outside, the cluster of different architectural additions over the centuries is intriguing to see, particularly the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel (1533) which was beautiful and is considered the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps, dedicated to the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty. It's worth noting that the site was getting quite busy and numerous tour groups were congregating and piling through the cathedral. Because it was a relatively small cathedral, this crowding did feel slightly uncomfortable (but still manageable) at times. There were no photos permitted inside the cathedral. 

We ascended the steep steps of the Royal Sigismund Bell tower which led to the bell at the top and a slightly restricted view over the city through a wire barrier. There was a photo op to touch the bell's clapper, which is considered good luck. Once again it was quite busy in this space owing to the crowds, luckily there was a separate descent staircase available.

We then walked down Wawel Hill into the expansive 13th century town square (Rynek Główny), the so-called ‘biggest medieval square in Europe’ according to some sources, but Charles Square in Prague is actually two times larger FYI. Our first port of call was the free to enter Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) shopping arcade in the middle of the town square, many vendor outlets sold what looked like traditional Polish goods, in particular the amber goods typical of the region and many other figurines, souvenirs, and models. 

After this we entered the grand Brick Gothic St. Mary's Basilica which sadly had a cladding of scaffolding on the main tower due to longterm repairs, meaning ascending the tower was not possible. The interior was beautiful but it was a fairly brief experience after sitting down to soak up all the churchiness. Every hour a bugle player plays a traditional five-note bugle call (hejnał) from the basilica's tallest tower. They often wave down at the crowds below. We popped into the Muzeum Farmacji (Pharmacy Museum), it is a small museum which features a good collection of pharmacy paraphernalia, but I wasn't raving about it after a few rooms full of similar jars and pots. The information and presentation of the museum appeared to have been unchanged for many years.

Walking around Wawel Hill and the town itself, images of the Polish Pope, John Paul II (1920-2005) - born Karol Józef Wojtyła - can be seen in many places, some may even say excessively! I found it quite whimsical seeing so many portraits of JP2, even despite my reservations about the Catholic Church as an institution. You can sometimes see monks walking around the town on their daily commutes.

**Day 2:**

On our second day we hopped on a guided tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. The tour was well organised although the bus itself was fairly cramped. First we stopped at Auschwitz I (Stammlager), known as former administrative and operational centre of the death-camp, and we're given headsets to hear a crystal clear transmission of the guide's voice as we were taken around the site as part of the group tour. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was the more visually striking of the two sites, with the instantly recognisable gatehouse and train tracks. The Birkenau site was even bigger than I'd imagined. The barbed wire fences and guard towers tapered off into the distance, with the site covering 6,000 football pitches of space. Both sites put together were a moving warning about humanity's darkest capabilities, with well-selected and impactful exhibits. Although I could see no central dedicated museum building. We returned to Kraków, getting back at around 7pm before then going to ‘The Black Duck’ restaurant which was very good value and enjoyable (plus points for duck theming), it was hands down the culinary highlight of the trip. Walking back to our accommodation we were solicited by a prostitute, but politely turned down the offer.

**Summary:**

I found Poland quite dour. A number of the eateries we went to nearly all played melancholic music, many of the souvenir shops stock items with an intriguing tearful girl theme, combining this melancholia with a sudden rundown post-communist greyness (and countless graffitied walls) almost immediately outside of Kraków's Old Town district, the hyped up Kazimierz area is no exception to this. Alongside the city's proximity to a major former Nazi death-camp, the experience was somewhat overshadowed by these things. Of course, Poland cannot easily separate itself from this history under Soviet &amp; Nazi occupation and before that being partitioned three times (the Austrian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition) in the late 18th century leading to 123 years of no Polish sovereignty. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed. The identity and nation of the Poles has been under threat for centuries and I think this reflects in the locals' outlook and culture, they are a guarded people fiercely interested in their national identity and faith. This is a nation in the process of regaining its pride and sense of self. The creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, was only founded in 1989, making modern Poland only 35 years old. In 2022, Poland, Greece, and Cyprus had the highest percentage of adults in the EU at risk of depression, with a share of 65 percent. This is a country with many depressed and downhearted people, but Poland is certainly moving through a period of new beginnings.

Another thing to mention is the Cracovian road zebra crossings don't often have traffic lights. So there were a number of times I felt unsafe trusting motorists to spot me and stop to allow me to safely cross the road. With that being said there isn't a lot of traffic around Kraków and locals are encouraged to use the trams.

Tourist attractions around Kraków were okay, it's very church-heavy reflecting the Catholic way of life there. At times I felt the historical museums could have told Poland's national story more narratively and engagingly. I understand there was a golden age for Poland before the partitions and then occupations during the 20th century. This golden age roughly corresponds to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572).

However, I found the Cracovian museums to be more descriptive than narrative in tone, drily listing information rather than arranging it for a modern touristic palette. Because Poland's history is more on the niche side, I'd have hoped for a more comprehensive overview/retelling. The Rynek Underground Museum (under the town square) seemed like a tourist trap displaying a banal arrangement of rocks and pillars. I decided to avoid entry. The same can be said of the former town hall tower, the view is said to be extremely limited.

To justify a trip to Kraków I recommend spending about two days there max. You will enjoy great value for money on food and drink but the tourist sites are nothing out of this world. You should ideally combine the town with a day trip to either the salt mine or Auschwitz-Birkenau, or perhaps to the mountains nearby if you are outdoorsy (the Tatra Mountains and Zakopane, a popular resort town in the foothills of the mountains). I recommend taking in the town slowly, it shouldn't be rushed as you may quickly run out of things to do if you are not careful.

I give Kraków an overall 5.5/10.

**Souvenirs:**

I struggled to find many souvenirs/keepsakes that really caught my eye. I would recommend having a look in the Kraków Cloth Hall and the outlets on the outside of the building, although I felt much of the items for sale were almost identical between the stalls, the variety on offer was unfortunately lacking. 
I recommend checking out Niebieska Kropka Boleslawiec Pottery and the ""Kacper Ryx"" Historical Shop. I purchased a handmade fridge magnet from the latter which was fairly pricey, but had rustic appeal. I also stumbled across the Wawel Castle Souvenir shop (to the left of the courtyard entrance as you enter) and it turned out to be one of the better souvenir shops in Kraków. So do check that out.

**Food:**

None of my travel review should be considered exhaustive, but I highly recommend going to Czarna Kaczka/ Black Duck for authentic Polish cuisine. Try the Borscht (beetroot soup), it's very tasty. Also make sure you have pierogi somewhere during your visit. For breakfast I heartily recommend Milkbar Tomasza and the savoury pancake with spinach and cheese filling.",1728305046.0,2024-10-08 12:04:38
t3_1fxrmv5,sabbatical travel from Canada,"So next year I'm on sabbatical. When I say next year, I basically mean September 2025 to June 2026 (I'm a teacher...that's a year for me with summer being a bonus!lol)

I'm hoping to travel as much as my money will allow. We live in Montreal. My son is off one week in November and one week in April (Easter) so I'm looking for a destination with him. He will be 15 and obsessed with Disney. We have already been to the Florida and California ones. He wants to be an imagineer when he's older. Some ideas: Paris with Disneyland, a Disney cruise from Florida, Greece (he's also into mythology and Percy Jackson). He's not a picky eater which is good for traveling and loves museums. 

My daughter will have the first three weeks of January off. She will be 18 and is very easy going. Not really into museums. She wants to learn how to surf and is super into Asian culture (but Japan is a no no which will be explained later). I was thinking Vietnam, Costa Rica, a cruise, New Zealand, a cruise, etc. We can also do a group thing (Intrepid or G adventures). She will not travel somewhere where she needs an extra vaccine! lol!

At some point during my break I'm planning on going to Japan with my husband. Just the two of us. We aren't sure when, probably October or early March (before blossoms). I think we should add South Korea since it's close.

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I am not bound to specific vacation times like when I'm teaching. Usually I can only travel during the summer (which is too bad since we have great weather here and have a pool we like to enjoy), Christmas or March break.

t3_1fwo3rv,Croatia Road Trip 2024,"This summer I went on a trip to Croatia with my family. We rented a car and went from Zagreb all the way to Dubrovnik. Here’s a summary.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

t3_1fxnfc4,How to setup a trip through the Pacific Northwest in August with a toddler,"We are a couple with a 3 year old kid and I’m in charge of suggesting an itinerary for a trip next August. 

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

t3_1fxk2d5,13 Day Itinerary Check - Switzerland,"Hello! I tend to be an overly type A, ambitious person when it comes to traveling because I want to see everything I possibly can. I also love planning and making itineraries.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

We're aiming for mid-late May 2025. Thank you in advance!

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast. While sometimes we decide a full packed day is worth it, we often like to go out and do something, come back to the hotel and nap/chill, and go back out for the late afternoon/evening.

t3_1fxgsrz,Should I tweak my New Zealand Itinerary to add 1 night in Hawke's Bay?,"I am planning a return trip to New Zealand's North Island after doing a 2 week trip to the South Island last year. I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

t3_1fxn2ye,Best place to travel cost-benefic for someone earning $MXN,"Hello everyone!

I’m looking for travel recommendations, considering I’m based in Mexico and earn in Mexican pesos (MXN). I’ll be traveling with my partner, so we’re particularly interested in destinations that offer a great balance between affordability and amazing experiences. Our budget isn’t huge, so we’re hoping to find places where the cost of living, food, and activities won’t break the bank but still allow us to enjoy what we love.

Some preferences:

	•	We both love beach destinations and sporting events/places.
	•	Open to both domestic (Mexico) and international destinations.
	•	We enjoy outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and trying local food.
	•	Safety is also an important factor.

Any suggestions for cities, regions, or countries where the exchange rate or cost of living makes it easier for a couple earning in pesos to enjoy the beach and catch some sports? Thanks in advance for your advice!",1728238919.0,2024-10-08 12:04:39

t3_1fxdr8n,2+ weeks in Guatemala and Belize,"Hi,

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

What doesn't make sense to me is the trip from Atitlan to Flores as it's a 10-12 hours journey. But then it makes sense to get from Flores to Belize.

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

Would you amend the time spend in any of the placea above? I hear mixed opinions about Semuc Champey so skipped it as it's a long journey.

t3_1fxgmu1,Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

I am very concerned that I will lose weight during the hike.

t3_1fxbat3,Cairns/Port Douglas vs. Auckland for last big trip from Australia,"My partner and I have lived in Australia a few years and are currently in Hobart. We plan to move back to North America in the next year and are deciding between two options for our final big (expensive) trip - The Great Barrier Reef or New Zealand. 

Due to timing and cost, we can only spend a week, so we’d be limited to just one of the islands in NZ. Timing is in the next two months, which I know isn’t great as we get into rainy season for QLD, but that’s what works for our schedules. I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. ",1728200554.0,2024-10-08 12:04:39

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her. We’ve both been Booking members for almost the exact same amount of time, booked about the same amount (we go back and forth each trip), and are both at the same Genius level as well as the same amount of bookings away from reaching the next level.

What is going on here? I understand d A/B testing or selectively offering different locations and devices certain rates, but we are, for the most part, going into the searches with the exact same parameters.

Both on iPhones, same IP, same Genius level, about the same past spending.

And yet, she’s getting minor to massive discounts every time and I’m stuck more or less just paying the normal rate…

t3_1fxl3yr,Cairo really doesn't deserve the bad reputation.... ,"As the title says

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

So its basically 

Vietnam/India/Philippines/New Zealand

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)",1728201948.0,2024-10-08 12:04:39
t3_1fwkv4m, Magic in Macedonia,"Macedonia took us by surprise. It’s not the first place people think of when they plan a Balkan trip, but man, it should be. We drove through Skopje, with its mix of old-world charm and modern quirks, and ended up camping by Lake Ohrid. The stillness of the lake, surrounded by mountains, had this calming effect—like you were in a different world.

One night, we met a group of Macedonian travelers who invited us to a small village festival. There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them. We nursed the van back to the nearest town, with every downhill stretch feeling like a gamble. A quick fix at another local garage got us going again, but it was a reminder that this adventure came with real risks.",1728112764.0,2024-10-08 12:04:39

However after doing a lot of research online, I’m getting mixed messages about this and I imagine things have changed since 2019. 

Booking through an agency seems expensive, but at least you’re guaranteed a spot.

My partner and I with our family are heading to Panama at the beginning of January and trying to decide between staying in **Bocas del Toro** or **Bastimentos Island**.

* **Scuba dive** and **snorkel**
* **Fish**
* Spot some local **wildlife**
* Relax on a **nice sandy beach**

We’re not into the super-commercial vibe, so if anyone has recommendations on where to stay that’s more quiet and off-the-beaten-path, we’d really appreciate it! Also, if anyone has tips on which island is better for the activities I mentioned, that would be super helpful.

t3_1fx2p7q,Looking for advice/recommendations for Europe itinerary ,"Hi all,

I'm planning a trip to Europe for May of next year, where I will be traveling with my parents and sister for about 14 days. The current very rough outline is to fly into Prague, spending several days there and possibly adding day trips to Kutna Hora or other nearby towns. We would then make our way to Munich where we would also spend several days. We would end our trip in Switzerland, spending about a week there before flying out from Zurich. My questions are:

Are 14 days a viable amount of time for this plan?

Would it make more sense to rent a car or travel exclusively by train?

Are there any places along this general route that you would recommend visiting?

Where would you advise staying overnight or spending a day in Switzerland?

Our interests include sites with historical value such as old city centers, castles, etc, as well as museums and architecture. We also look forward to trying some good local beer and experiencing nature. I am looking into all of this myself of course, but I have seen some great advice for various trips in this sub and would love to hear what you all think! Thank you in advance.

In retirement planning, my wife and I want to continue to travel, but I have had recent realizations making me really think of how to do that once we're retired. We live in the USA. My worry is the realization that Medicare doesn't cover you if you're traveling to places like Europe or Asia. But at that age, it seems like a chance of an ER visit may be greater. Like if I'm 70 and had a heart attack, do you just screw yourself for the rest of your retirement? My current insurance provides health care abroad, but I'd hate to work to my death just for the health care. I'd also hate to not travel just for the chance I might have an ER visit. Do you just buy travel insurance for the trip to cover that? I've seen things like Faye but then I also read that they can be a pain to deal with and not pay out. thanks for any insight you all can provide. I've got a long time (25+ years) until I retire so this could be a completely different thing by then, but trying to be ahead of the game.",1728151212.0,2024-10-08 12:04:39

t3_1fwza4i,Hawaii Flights Question - DEN vs. SFO Transfer,"Hi everyone,

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport? Also does anyone know Denver airport well? Would we have to switch terminals in order to get to the domestic departures gate from the international arrivals gate? I know they have 6 terminals, but please also let us know the fastest method to get there and how long it would take. Thanks!",1728159321.0,2024-10-08 12:04:39

Thinking we could do something like this...

Option 1:
- Arrive in Barcelona on 19 September - 6 nights 
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 1 night (breaking up the N to S journey)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 3 nights
- Fly home (13 October)

OR

Option 2:
- Arrive in Madrid on 11 September - 1 night to settle in
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 3 nights 
- Barcelona - 6 nights (quicker trip same day rather than having to arrive the night before directly from San Sebastian and lose a night there)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 1 night
- Fly home (6 October)

All domestic travel by train. 

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1.

t3_1fw3r80,Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else.

t3_1fx4okn,Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues. Orbitz doesn't even need to admit any error. But they do need to fix it.

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right?

t3_1fwzwzs,I have both travel insurance and travel benefits from my credit card - claim with both?,"Hi there, long time reader, first time writer :) I can't for the life of me find any information on this on the web and will call someone tomorrow. Just thought I'd throw it out there now and see if anyone has experienced this before:

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both? Just trying to see how to maximize my claims approval since I'm double covered..so why not?

t3_1fwkuuu,The Call of the Road (Croatia),"I remember the first time we hit the road in that old T4 van. Croatia was our starting point, and the Adriatic coast didn’t disappoint. We cruised through winding coastal roads, with the sea sparkling on one side and dramatic cliffs on the other. Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot. A small mechanic in a nearby village became our savior, and after a few laughs (and a couple of beers shared while he worked), we were back on the road.

t3_1fvoezl,"The Underrated Gems of Cáceres &amp; Merída, Spain","Extremadura is a region in SW Spain that even Spaniards don't visit that much. I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

t3_1fwg3ws,I  need travel destination ideas for a memorable trip with my grandparents. My grandfather was just diagnosed with mild Parkinsons. I don't know how long he will be able to travel as that progresses.  ,"**About travelers**:

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. ",1728094584.0,2024-10-08 12:04:41

I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum

I booked a Bus to Denizli to see Pammukale and a flight to back to Istanbul and take my Return flight o LAX on October 10th, however, my main concern is that the travel Agency will Cancel my Returning Ticket for whatever reason they want to

I’ve had a look at these places and have listed out the particular ones that I would like to visit.

In Bali, I find Gili T, Nusa Penida, Ubud and Uluwatu nice but considering I’m only going for a week I would probably leave Gili T and Nusa Penida out. I am considering Bali but it honestly is my last option as how touristy it is kind of turns me off.

In Vietnam, I would really like to visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Hoi an. I am not sure if this is too many places for one week. Phu quoc is also on the list but I’ve heard it is a tourist trap (?)

Thailand. I haven’t really looked at a particular place in Thailand yet but I am considering visiting Thailand as it would be the “best” time to visit.

Disclaimer: Maybe this should be for r/ AskA""Nearly""Canadian, but I couldn’t find that particular group! Askacanadian moderated it out and the immigration reddits dont seem to cover it , so apologies for posting something oddly specific in r/travel 

I’m looking to book a sunny getaway this winter for my partner and me from Canada. I noticed there are several countries that a Canadian Permanent Resident can visit with their PR card and passport, even if the passport isn’t super powerful.

Has anyone traveled from Canada to any of these places (with PR card in hand + their *weak* national passport)? Are some more relaxed than others? Any tips or things to avoid (besides the usual travel advice)? I know I need to do more research once we decide, but I’m hoping for some personal experiences with immigration etc., like *how you fared with your all-inclusive trip to Cancun with Transat* or something(definitely avoiding USA stopovers!).

It was never an issue for me with my strong European passport, but I gather it might be trickier for someone with a weaker one like my better half. I just want to understand all the angles before getting her hopes up!  

Here’s the list I found online:

* All Dutch Caribbean territories
* Anguilla
* Bahamas
* Belize
* Bermuda

* Dominican Republic

t3_1fw7sg0,Did I get scammed? ,"So I recently canceled a hotel reservation with Expedia. I called the hotel and they gave me a number to call: (888) 432-7981.

Seemed legitimate but due to being impacted by hurricane Helene, I couldn’t provide the confirmation code due to no service or WiFi (called via landline). They gave me a different number and gave me a 50% refund.

This week I had signal and wanted to see if I could get the other 50% as it would be helpful considering the hurricanes impact on us. Called the number above and they worked to see what they could do. They offered me credits for the other half and told me that it would be a $99 service fee for this since it was a manual refund. 

I believe I started to be scammed here.

I gave them my credit card info (I don’t think I should have done this looking back), and they sent me an email from: reservations@thebookingconfirmation.com. It was a receipt and information but it looks shady. The charge on my credit card also shows as: airtktservices(followed by a number). 

What really made me think I just got scammed is they said I would have to call a specific number in order to use the credits: +1-844-202-1445.

t3_1fw6nft,"I Need Advice With My Travel Itinerary (Beer Trip, Focusing on Belgium) — It's My 1st Time In Europe","Next year, I'll be taking a 22-day solo trip around Europe to celebrate my 40th birthday, starting with **Belgian Beer Weekend and ending with Oktoberfest**. My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi.

This specific flight is in partnership with Japan Airline and is operated by JAL as well. 

I recently received an email from both AA and JAL saying my flight was changed. In the JAL email, they proposed to have my flight destination changed to HND instead, which would be great for me. I went through their process and booked the new flight. 

However this new flight is NOT in partnership with AA. At the confirmation page, I receive the following message (screenshot). When I check in my AA app, I see both flights been included (where the JAL flight doesn’t have a corresponding AA flight number)

Want to ask: 1) is it possible to pay for an AA flight and make a change to a JAL flight not in partnership with AA? 2) what’s the right next step here? Worst case scenario would be to have my original flight canceled and the new flight not go through.

However, I would like to extend my trip by a bit longer (my girlfriend unfortunately will not be able to join me as she works full time and won't have the vacation time to do so).

Desires:

Good Nature

Cultural scene

budget friendly

Not too difficult to fly back to the USA from.

I was thinking of maybe:

French Riviera (although that may be too expensive - honestly not sure as I haven't looked too deeply at prices for that area)

Spain - Madrid

Greece

Norway

t3_1fvzqax,China in July - 15 days itinerary question,"Hello everyone!

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

t3_1fw509b,Morocco 9-day itinerary tips,"Hi everyone! Me and my partner are going to Morocco for a 9-day trip in November (including travel days), it's our first time there and I would like some tips! It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

  
And if you have any other tips about Morocco and traveling there, please let me know :) ",1728063497.0,2024-10-08 12:04:41

Osaka to Shanghai Pudong = Peach Aviation (arriving 24:20)

Shanghai Pudong to Bangkok = Thai Lion Air (departing 02:40)

Luggage: HAND CARRY ONLY!

Layover time: 2 hours 20 mins

- Since we don't have any check in luggage, is it possible to just go to the transfer desk and get a boarding pass there? (Note: Thai Lion Air doesn't allow online check in for international flights according to their website)

- If not, do we have to apply for a transit visa just so we can go through immigration and customs and then check in again at the Thai Lion Air counter?

- OR can we just go straight to immigration and customs and they will issue us a transit visa there considering we are not leaving the airport and only getting out of airside so we can check in again?

I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone. I even went through the painstaking process of registering the drone in Greece and I felt even that was a complete waste of my time. Just thought I would share my experience.

t3_1fvym2g,I have three weeks to fill between England and Berlin in Nov. What's off the beaten track? And what's essential?,"Title says it - I want to be in Northeast England in early Nov, and my flight home is from Berlin in late Nov. I want to take my time while also seeing as many cool things as I can before I fly back to the my side of the globe.

  
I've got some ideas of what I want to see: definitely spend time exploring London and Berlin, stop off somewhere in the Netherlands, look into stopping off in Scotland or France (but I bet it will be very cold and dark in Scotland!). I'm super interested in the history and the culture, so looking for museums and old architecture, and anything else that will be a fun memory.

  
So my big questions are:

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

t3_1fvrfir,Urgent: Bulgarian airlines Lost Luggage Tag,"Hey!

I went on a work related trip to Sofia (Bulgaria) and I flew home to Lisbon (Portugal) two days ago. After arriving in Lisbon, I wasn’t able to find my bag and realized it had been lost.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

let me introduce myself. hi, i am 25 and just graduated uni. after a long time dreaming, i decided to finally go on the trip of my dreams. we visited 8 countries and rode planes, buses, trains, ferries, we did it all. really it was an amazing trip, but i come back home feeling more empty than ever. my friends fought the whole time, my one friend had a meltdown in each country we visited about random stuff, i felt stressed and annoyed a lot of the time. 

we don’t live in the same province and now that i am back home (i still live my parents:( ) and away from my friends i just.. idk. i’m left to figure things out again, but im more broke than ever now. i just feel the crushing weight of having to pay my bills and catch up with everyone who stayed and continued their normal lives while i disconnected from everything and now still feel disconnected af. i also left my job to do this (i didn’t wanna work there for long anyway) so i also am jobless😭

t3_1fueq0d,Ten days in Brazil 🇧🇷 ,"Recently I had the chance to visit Brazil and wanted to share some of my picture and experiences.  I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice.

My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out. 

- assuming my flights go without delay, I will arrive at the airport at 10:30pm and my car rental from fox is scheduled to be picked up at 11:30pm. I am worried I didn’t give myself enough time to deal with finding my checked bags and dealing with customs or whatever. Can I just call the place in advance if I’m running late?

- We are scheduled to stay at the Luxor hotel for the first 3 nights but we will only most likely be checking in at like midnight - 1am the first night. Is this worth calling them in advance?

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

I've been recommended to get an eSIM in addition to a VPN for China.

I'm looking at going to go to multiple countries around Asia, China being one. So I have been looking at Asia/Regional plans with good amount of data for good pricing.

I'm looking for one that will allow me to use Whatsapp and/messenger to call family back home (and having both an eSIM and VPN were highly recommended). So I'm wondering if Saily has been working fine for people even if NordVPN isn't?

t3_1fvs80v,"6 Days in Scotland for 2, is ~$2700 USD (after flights and lodging) enough to have fun?","(EDIT: 6 Full days in Scotland, 8 days total. Just went ahead and excluded travel days)

I budgeted about 6K total for the trip, is what I have leftover enough to have good food/cool experiences with?

For reference, just booked my flights via Delta and Aer Lingus for about $2500 total round trip for both me and my S/O, coming from Chicago. Booked all of our lodging for about $800 total for 6 nights. We’re staying in East Lothian (East Liston for 2 nights &amp; Haddington 4 nights).

So far as getting around is concerned, we won’t have a car. I’m hoping to rely on both ride share and the trains for travel around the coast (North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady, Musselburgh, Dunbar, etc). Any suggestions on what is most cost effective? Is this a reliable way to get around relatively efficiently? Obviously we’ll plan to do a lot of walking around in each village/area, but getting to each area is my main focus here. Is Uber reliable in that area? Are the trains fairly inexpensive? 

Still looking for cool pubs, restaurants, sights, etc in each of the places I mentioned. Obviously we’ll stumble on some hidden gems just walking around, but any suggestions are much appreciated!

Just fyi, I’d like to exclude Edinburgh for the most part. But I’d love for someone to change my mind! I’ve heard there’s a lot of tourist traps around the city and with that comes more excessive spending which we’re trying to avoid. 

Again, any advice and comments are much appreciated.

I am not sure if it is best to spend so long in HCMC, or if we should spread some of those days to a different city. We are interested in historical places/museums, shorter hikes, beaches, and good food. Also, any additional tips about day trips from the big cities would be awesome!

t3_1fv8yyh,Help my expand my Asia trip,"Hi, I am a single 36M from the UK and I have booked my first solo trip (hurray!) to Japan some weeks ago. Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

I’m planning my winter holidays and need some advices

contexte : I am a 30 French woman from Paris and I have some holidays from the 19th till the 1st of january 2025, I might extend them till the 13th as the 13th is my bday i want to be away for this. So its between the 19th till 13th January.  
i’ll travel solo and have a budget of \~2500. My non-négociable is : nothing COLD, for me winter holidays are to go as much as possible from the gloomy weather, a little break from the winter depression.  
i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

Sorry for the long post, I welcome all feedback/ suggestions. Any help welcome !

t3_1fvauvm,4-Day Trip in Late October - Iceland or Tromsø Without a Car? Need Recommendations!,"Hey fellow travelers!

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting. Again, we are really wanting Colorado but I just worry about the altitude sickness. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! ",1727976775.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42

t3_1fvpzkk,Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

t3_1fv6h7f,VAT refund Barcelona Airport Experience ,"I’m traveling with my mother in barcelona. I’m flying home earlier than my mother while she continues her travels. She placed all of her purchases under my passport and I am planning to attempt a VAT refund by myself (I will not be taking all items purchased with me, they’re all smaller items and can also claim they are items I already have if they do ask) She said some airports are more relaxed and did not need to show all items when submitting for the refund. How has your experiences been in the past with the Barcelona airport? Did you really need to show all of the items? I’m just planning on checking the items that I’m bringing with me so will do this prior to security. 

I’ve also read some threads that said there are locations in barcelona that stamp the receipts before the airport so you do not need to check the items there. Can you do this before your day of departure and how does that work? Would you suggest this instead?

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1727943901.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42

Im very young obviously so money is scarce, i’ll have enough for the flights, and i’ve made the budget of $1000 for accommodation/food. I plan on staying in cheap hotels / hostels most of the time, with thailand being the only exception as it is so cheap there to book a decent airbnb.

With the months in consideration, i know i might have to remove/add some destinations i just havent thought of yet. Thats were this post comes in!

t3_1fv2xqr,Has anyone from outside Germany ever processed a paper DB (Deutsche Bahn) compensation claim?,"So long story short DB owes me some €300 (cancelled trains and overnight stranding). It's been 2 months and all that has happened so far is this:

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point).",1727943868.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? ",1727895112.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42

We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

t3_1fuh6qq,Three weeks in Taiwan this November,"1. Is November a good time to go?  Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

Thank you for any advice you are able to give!",1727878443.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42
t3_1fueo5c,"Travel Plan from Santa Maria CA, to Las Vegas, to the Grand Canyon","I have this travel plan set for February. I chose this month because in my occupation that's the slowest work month and leaving at that particular time wouldn't be a big burden on the company. And the state I live in gets extremely cold and depressing during that month, so I figured this would be an ideal time to escape. I have this travel plan set for an entire week (Monday through Sunday). 

My plan is to fly to Santa Maria, California. Get a hotel and a rental car. Stay there for about two days, and then drive on out to Las Vegas and stay there for about two or three days, and then end off the trip in Arizona at the Grand Canyon.

t3_1fu7vaf,"Mainly for European travelers but, has anyone had an experience where they are asked for Identification by police or other institutions and could only provide a Drivers’ License?","
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;
Paying for a parking ticket in Verona (through post office);
Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened? Were you fined? Jailed? Were you refused admission or services to something? How were you able to correct the issue?",1727842783.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42

t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place",1727805935.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you.",1727936827.0,2024-10-08 12:04:42

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

t3_1futh8l,London or Manchester for My First Solo Trip? Need Recommendations!,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 23-year-old guy planning my first solo trip and trying to decide between London and Manchester. I’m particularly interested in catching a Manchester United game at Old Trafford and checking out some good house music DJs while I’m there.

I’d love your thoughts on the following:

Which city has more to offer for a solo traveler?

Is one city generally cheaper than the other for accommodation, food, and activities?

How easy is it to get around each city and what’s the transportation like between London and Manchester?

Any areas or things to avoid in either city?

I’m currently living in the Netherlands (since past 7 years), and I’ve renounced my Pakistani nationality few years ago. I’ve traveled to about 35 countries across Europe, Asia, and America, and one destination I’ve always wanted to explore is India. I’ve heard so many wonderful things about the cities, culture, and landscapes from my Indian friends here in the Netherlands, which has made me even more eager to visit. I’ve actually wanted to travel to India for quite some time now, to experience everything I’ve heard about firsthand.

I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into how difficult or easy it might be to get a visa for India as someone of Pakistani origin? Are there any specific restrictions or places I might not be able to visit because of my background?

I’m just looking for any helpful information or experiences regarding the visa process and any potential travel limitations. I would really appreciate your advice. I’m approaching this with the utmost respect and a genuine desire to explore and learn.

Thanks so much in advance for your help!

t3_1ftl7an,Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.",1727780037.0,2024-10-08 12:04:43

t3_1fu4hfm,Solo traveler planning Alsace wine + foodie trip 12/2 - 12/5. Recommendations please!,"I'm a 38/F planning a solo trip to Alsace in early December and am trying to figure out my itinerary including where to stay, eat, and the best options for visiting wineries! I'm hoping for some recommendations on how to cut costs where possible and spend more where it counts.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne. Historically I've done semi-private tours but I'd definitely be open to saving money if I can get around by myself either via car or the Kut'Zig - I'm not sure if there are wineries that are easy to access/open to the public or by appointment to someone outside the industry.

I also would love to hit up the Strasbourg Christmas market for maybe an afternoon, but wine, food, and wandering/exploring are higher priorities for this trip vs. more ""touristy"" activities like visiting castles, etc. 

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access. Wherever I stay, I'll mainly be there just to sleep but it's important that it's safe and clean, but would flex for the right experience (again as long as I can make up for added costs elsewhere!)

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days? 

Budget: im hoping to get the price under 2.000$ just for this week for hotels, food and daily activities.

Since we are probably not going there anytime soon anymore we would like to add as much as possible.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass. But that means having to go and line up at the  bag drop line and that can take an hour at least. As I have no bags to drop that makes for a very frustrating experience!

You have successfully checked in! Please note: We cannot provide you the boarding pass online now, you need to obtain it at the airport.

* Come early to the airport on the day of your flight to make sure you have enough time to obtain your boarding pass.

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

t3_1fu4o30,What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible. 

I posted on my Instagram story what happened and had 13 ppl reaching out that they went through the same thing with AirSerbia :(((((/ one of my friend who is originally from Belgrade sent me an email address that is at their LOST AND FOUND office door in Belgrade ( ???? ) and after I sent an email there, they responded that my baggage was still in Belgrade ( ???? ). When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!!

t3_1ft24dp,"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

I'm kicking off a solo adventure around a few spots in SEA with a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and was wondering if its worth staying in a hostel or if I should just go with a regular hotel. Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

t3_1fu03t7,Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?",1727819290.0,2024-10-08 12:04:43
t3_1ftrcwn,Recommendations for beach vacation in Mexico,"Hello my wife and I are looking to honeymoon this February in Mexico. We a looking into going to an all inclusive resort but are open to other options. The singular most important thing to us is the beach. Ideally warm with a bit of surf so we can body board. Maybe some good sea shells as well.  We live in and work hard out in the the snow in the winter so we want to escape a bit. We don't need the place to be super fancy, a pool would be nice with bar but not mandatory. We are not interested in any spas or other activities, we do plenty of ""adventuring"" other times of the year. Any suggestions for best place to be at the beach, bar or pool for 12 hours a day? We are open to other options besides all inclusive it just seemed the most convenient.

t3_1fst66x,"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",1727695522.0,2024-10-08 12:04:43
t3_1fso6rm,12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

t3_1fsu2ec,Hotel / Resort fees getting out of control?,"
Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

My only requests for this trip are trying a NYC hotdog and a slice of pizza (LOL), seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, going to the American Museum of Natural History, and finding some good dessert spots/other eateries. He is not a sweets/sugar person so he has left me in charge of that.

Stay: we have yet to book the hotel but we will be staying right in Times Square 

What he has discussed booking so far: going to MoMA, American Museum of Natural History, two evening shows (a play off Broadway and the blue man group), either Little Italy or China Town, shopping on 5th avenue, and a few restaurants he really wants me to try as they are favorites of his.

I am planning a trip to Morocco and in my plan, I'll take the ferry from Tangier to Tarifa, then local transportation to Malaga. Simple answer to this route, rather than just fly away, is that I wan to try something fun, and the Strait of Gilbralter is on my checklist as well. The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

However, I'd like to consult your experiences if I should do Tangier-Tarifa or TangierMed-Algeciras. For now I choose Tangier-Tarifa since it's 40-60 min ferry plus 30-50 min bus, shorter than TangierMed-Algeciras with 20-30min ride plus 2.5hr ferry. I will be staying in the town of Tangier, for the eve.

Besides, I am a bit uncertain about the local transportation between Tarifa and Algeciras. Rome2Rio tells me that there are regular bus routs operated by local transportation company. My concern is that what about the fare and how should I pay the ticket? Does it take credit card? or I should buy the ticket somewhere?

After arriving Malaga, I will be staying Malaga for 2 nights and then fly back. Should I book my day tour to Granada and Alhambra?

Day 1 (Oct 13): PM - arrive late to Montreux from Geneva, dinner. 

Day 2: AM - Walk to Chillon Castle, boat tour if time/weather line up. 
PM: Lavaux vineyards walk (Cully -Saint Saphorin). Dinner there/Montreux. 

Day 3: Gruyeres - chateau du Gruyeres, HR Giger Museum (we are Alien fans lol), etc. Train back to Montreux/dinner 

Day 4: AM - train to Zermatt 
PM - Stellisee lake weather permitting/Zermatt bopping 

Day 5: AM - Early Gornergrat, Riffelsee, proposal 🥳. Matterhorn glacier if time/weather 
PM: BEAUSite spa. Dinner at Omnia. 

Day 6: AM - train to Wengen. 
PM: Mannlichen-kleine schedegg if weather permits/lauterbrunnen valley option 

Day 7: (all options) Murren North face hiking, gimmewald, Eiger Trail, schilthorn, jungfraujoch

Day 8: see day 7. Mix/match accordingly 

Day 9: AM - lauterbrunnen valley 1 last time. Train to Lucerne. 
PM - bop around Lucerne 

Day 10: Lucerne City exploring. Old village, museums, boating weather permitting, etc. 

Day 11: rigi/pilatus/stoos ridge (still deciding - open to suggestions). 

Day 12: AM: train to Zurich (maybe stop in Zug for lunch??). 
PM: bop around Zurich 

Day 13: Zurich exploring, museums etc. 

Day 14: depart 

Weather may dictate some of these days. Have thought about training to Bern on any rainy days or other locations. We are pretty flexible and enjoy both hiking and city exploring. Have lived in Colorado for many years and understand October hiking will be layers, beanies, gloves.

Only using car horns

Buses are whole different things 
I don’t see exact stops 
Everybody just jumps up and down from the bus, and it’s usually still moving or it’s only stops for a few seconds 
People run after the bus and it stops in the middle of a crossing and basically everywhere.

So it’s pretty interesting to me. I’m bit afraid when I’m walking cross the road but it’s fine xd

Is this too good to be true or a scam? I don't want to book her ticket, have her show up at the airport, and this isn't even legit. The Indian embassy is useless here too, as there is no number to call, and if you make an appointment, they can barely speak English or convey anything properly.

So I said great I'm in the right spot. However, both those lines were going on 2 separate buses to the same place. When it came time to scan my ticket the driver said ""this isn't your bus"". I said how? I was told to come to this line and it's going to my destination. He said you missed your bus. And no, I did not come late. I was an hour in half early, my bus literally left minutes before. I asked can he please let me on the bus he said ""how much you got"" and was saying other very rude stuff to me but I digress. I lied and said I only have $20 so I gave him cash for him to let me on the bus. 

I contacted greyhound only wanting to get a partial refund of $20 on my ticket but they are of course saying it's nonrefundable. How is this my fault at all? Their app clearly said get in line D or E and the employee told me line D. The employees didn't even do calls for which bus is going where. You just had to assume what like to get in.

t3_1ft5pl2,7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)",1727728123.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

I have a question regarding a recent flight I got
From Hong Kong to Melbourne, Australia. 

I attempted to purchase 100 grams of tobacco from Hong Kong airport, well aware of the 25g limit when entering into Australia. 

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

t3_1ft6b8y,"Level Airline - Customer Service / Flight cancelation rebook, phone check-in. ","Departure: LAX 

Arrival: BCN 

Direct flight   A300-200 

  
**My parent's flight to Barcelona**

1. they purchased a ticket months ago. One way ticket.

**Problem** 

1. Cancelation  A day before the flight, the initial flight was canceled, and they got re-assigned to a different flight day later. 

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. ",1727729597.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

I would like to visit Vienna or Amsterdam but can’t decide… I need to fly on Lufthansa so it would be Munich-Vienna or Frankfurt-Amsterdam. 

(I’ve been to Munich and Frankfurt and will only spend a day or two so both doesn’t really matter)

I’ve been to Vienna (and other cities in Austria) as well but it was when I was younger, and I think the familiarity would help me on my first ever solo trip. 

I’ve never been to Netherlands, so it would be nice to have a new experience. Plus I will visit Rotterdam as well if I choose this. 

Things I have to consider:

Accommodation - I want clean and safe hotel. Novotel or other 4 star business hotels. But I heard Amsterdam is more expensive than Vienna…

Racism &amp; Overall Safety - I’m an Asian woman so… I never had unpleasant experience in any part of Austria but was wondering about Amsterdam. 

Sightseeing - My visit will be about a week long and won’t move around the country so it would be nice if the city is filled with tourist attractions.

Option # 2: Stay in a hotel in Mendoza city and take day trips to thermal hot springs, horseback riding, wine tour, etc.

The resort option sounds nice, but I worry about limiting ourselves to the resort itself and not being able to experience some of the more well known restaurants in the city or other activities.

Has anyone traveled to Mendoza before and have any input on whether we should stay in the city and be open to any restaurant/activity we'd like or if it would be better to book one of the resort type options?

2.	Stay in Madrid for the full week and take day/overnight trips to surrounding towns (Toledo, Sergovia, Salamanca).

Me (F23) and my parents (\~60) are looking to go on a trip for the holidays \~Dec 23-Jan 1 and are really curious about Tbilisi/surrounding areas. Thank you for reading over this slightly long post as I would love to hear from locals/people who have visited before. Would love some pretty honest/frank responses if it isn't a good idea to visit, for whatever reason.

* I haven't really seen a lot online about East Asians visiting Tbilisi, so was wondering if there's any air of hostility towards visitors who are Chinese. We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year.

t3_1fsy4ag,Zagreb airport online check in question,"Hello

If anyone has checked in online to an international flight from Zagreb airport while also having to check in the luggage at the counter:

Is the bag check in counter self automated for already checked in passengers or does a staff member check your boarding pass and then do it for you?

Cause I would rather the second option.

This is just a general question, and if it’s common place it’s more of me just bitching to yall lol

My newly wed wife and I are going to Santorini for our honeymoon, originally scheduled to get there on the first. We bought our tickets through American, and we’re going to be flying out of DFW to JFK (AA), and from JFK to London gatwick, and from Gatwick to Santorini (BA). Our flight from JFK got cancelled 24 hours before check in, and they rebooked us which now gets us getting there on the 3rd. 

My question is is this common? I called both BA and AA and they said because they rebooked we’re not eligible for a refund and cannot rebook to any other flights. If so, like I said this is more of me just bitching lol

t3_1fru0rh,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",1727575803.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45
t3_1fswfii,Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia. 

I would love any feedback, location suggestions, or just to hear your favorite places to spend a week! Thanks!!",1727705308.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

t3_1ft9id1,Bachelor Party Recommendations? (I'm the Last to Get Married),"So, I'm the last to get married among my group of guy friends and the last to try to plan a bachelor party. Admittedly, I've fallen a bit behind on planning something (I get married in May 2025). My fiance and I have another trip planned in March 2025 (Mexico), so I'm looking at either February or April for when to travel.

Among my friends, we've already done Vegas, Destin, Nashville, Charleston, hometown, and many who have elected to do nothing (multiple elopements and a Covid wedding). It's a group of roughly 10-12 guys. We are all in our early 30s. We're into good food and drinks, games (any kind, I've seen them turn a bottle cap into a drinking game), professional (and unprofessional?) sports, beaches, pools, and water activities. Not big clubbers, golfers, or hikers.

Personally, I love to cook, I like a boat and a lake, to visit an art museum, I tend to be nerdier, and my games of preference are card and board game.

Things that have been batted around in conversation: Ireland (too far for the dads), Montreal, Banff, Lake Tahoe, All Inclusive Resort (don't know where), Lakeside Cabin (don't know where), Austin, Chicago. Not sure if those primers help!

* Dates: February or April 2025
* Locations: Canada, USA, Central America, Caribbean
* Group Details: 10-12, 30ish yo Males, located on East Coast USA
* Vibes: Beers, Good Food, Games/Group Activities, Water (a plus, not necessary)
* Not Vibes: Clubs, Golf Courses, Appalachian Trail

t3_1ft45ni,Where to solo travel for 5 nights in late October for some type I fun?,"I have a week off between jobs and want to make the most of it, but my husband won't be able to join me. I have done some solo travel before and have learned that I'm happiest with small group tasks/activities during the day, otherwise I get a bit aimless and lonely. I am outdoorsy but more into type I versus type II fun. I'm fairly competent on bikes and horses and hikes, but I don't want to summit any mountains and I get lonely camping alone.  I live in a city and prefer nature when I travel.

  
Given all of this and my late October timeframe, any ideas on where to go?  I am on the east coast of the USA and would prefer to remain within a reasonably easy flight (while avoiding any areas that are at a high risk of a hurricane).  I am seriously craving sun after the recent weather here, post Helene.  I can comfortably spend 2-3K on this trip.

We’d love to take a proper break of ca. 3 weeks, but looking for ideas. We’re from the UK and the thought of going somewhere else cold to just “hunker down” sounds awful to me.. I already trapped at home and don’t want to be trapped indoors somewhere else slightly more cosy.

Ideas are either:
A) Somewhere super relaxing but hot so it’s a change and we can go in a pool / chill outdoors. 
In my head this would mean going quite far to say Bali or Mexico…

B) Say f*** it and be those people that take a baby to Japan because I’m dying to go.

C) Road trip round the states
Can’t decide if this is stupid given we can only drive 2 hours before taking breaks with the baby… 

D) Alternative ideas in Europe that avoid a longer flight?!

Would love suggestions on baby-friendly trips / what’s realistically going to be a great trip, even if different to how we travelled pre-baby.

t3_1ftfa1m,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",1727755390.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

We're leaving our 3yo at home with the grandparents and this might be one of our last kid-free trips. I'm torn between wanting to make the most of it and actually relaxing. Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

I have tried several times to contact the CAAZ to get approval and pay the registration fee but have gotten nowhere. I've contacted the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and they've advised me to ""bring all relevant paperwork and apply for an Application for Temporary Importation Privilege"" at the port of entry.

I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.

We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)

22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa
25th: Hanoi
26th: Flight home (evening)

Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

t3_1fsqxf2,Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!",1727685997.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

t3_1fsm1qw,Compare Flighty Vs Tripsy,"Hello everyone,

  
I'm an avid traveler. I usually like to keep my flights tracked through apps. I'm not too concerned with tracking hotel stays or car rental stuff, but it's good when I need it. I usually stay at Hilton hotels and use Avis for car rentals. Unless something unusual makes me deviate from either brand, I'm sticking to them. Flights on the other hand, are usually across many airlines. I like to keep a history of my flights too, just to see where I've been, so I do like the passport feature from Flighty.

I recently discovered Tripsy, I like the UI and I like the general itinerary record. I see that there is a flight/visited record feature, so that's a nice feature. This app reminds me of TripIt. I've used TripIt before, I didn't like the UI though. I didn't like the feel of the TripIt app, but I did love their website, which I ended up using far more than the app. One really great feature, although it's a pro feature, is the expense record keeping of Tripsy. It's really nice to see that immediately and not have to do that on the budgeting app.

I could go on and on about both apps. Again, I've used TripIt, I'm favoring Tripsy out of those two. But what are your thoughts of flight/itenarary keeping of both Flighty and Tripsy? Specifically, I'm thinking of getting a pro membership, so which one feels like you're getting your monies worth?

Look forward to all your responses.",1727665919.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45
t3_1froz5i,Money comments on having just returned from a trip to the UK.,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks in the UK, mostly touring by train and car. Wonderful trip but I noticed two things I didn't expect.

The UK was expensive! I would rank it right up there with Switzerland. We stayed in three star hotels and B&amp;B's, rated 8.0 or higher on Booking. We paid US$350 per night in London and Edinburgh, US$250 or less in the countryside, breakfast included. Restaurant prices were high too, we paid pound for dollar. Meaning that a pasta dish would cost GBP20, which is US$26. A burger might be GBP16 = US$21. Gasoline cost around US$8.50 per US gallon. Entrance fees for attractions were high, up significantly from the Rick Steve's prices we saw in a four year old book. Like US$40 to see Stonehenge. Museums in London were still free.

British restaurants have caught the tipping disease. They use hand held. point of sale devices for card payments (normal) and the bill almost always included an ""optional service charge"" of 10%. The server would point out that it's optional but there it was, already added into the bill. Incidentally, quite a few restaurants, pubs and deli's are cashless. It was payment by card only. If you go make sure you have a chip card. (Pay toilets in the parks cost 20 pence to use and no longer accept coins. You have to tap your credit card -- chip -- and you're in. It shows up as a 27 cent charge on your CC bill.)

Transportation: The train was expensive too, although we didn't try to book ahead to save money and did walk-up ticket purchases. London to York cost US$94 per person, second class. Car rental was a pleasant surprise. We reserved with Enterprise from the US five months before the trip and were pleased with both the price and the service. And you don't need an Oyster card for the London underground anymore. You can use a chip card in the same way and you get the same fare as with an Oyster card. You just tap in and tap out.

t3_1frdbjj,Brussels is Terrible,"Brussels was... underwhelming 

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels. 

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.  

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert. 

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck. 

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? ",1727526963.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

I am travelling to a region where the electricity supply is 220V.

I have a Samsung Galaxy phone. The OEM phone charger is dual voltage 100V - 240V. So no problem there. All I need is a suitable plug adapter so I can plug the OEM charger in their wall socket. 

Then I find a plug adapter on Amazon that has also a built-in USB port in additional to the regular US receptacles. The seller makes it very clear that this is just a plug adapter but not a voltage converter. 

Some people say because the adapter doesn't convert the voltage from 220V to 110V, I should plug your phone into the OEM phone charger (which take either voltage) and then plug the OEM phone charger into the wall socket via the plug adapter.

However, other people say you can skip the OEM phone charger and plug the phone directly into the USB ports using just the USB cord. They claim that even though the adapter isn't a voltage converter but the USB port will only output 5V, so the phone is safe.

Who is correct? Any real life experience?

t3_1fsjkpr,Destination indecision - thoughts wanted,"Hoping for some insight! Talking a two week trip at the end of November but can’t decide where. Getting close to being too late.

About me:

Traveling alone, single mid 40s male.

East Coast USA based.

Generally I love big cities but I also lean much more towards relaxing more than adventure. Beaches are ok. Hiking does nothing for me.

Which also means I generally don’t like more than 2 cities. 3 at a push. 1 is even fine if there are a bunch of day trips.

Museums are ok. Love street food and foodie stuff (non gourmet) in general.

Love things like replica markets. Love places like Akihabara.

Love animals so something like a town full of deer or monkeys or seeing elephants etc sounds great.

Pretty tall so long haul is hell unless I get a bulk head seat. This makes flights more expensive for me due to buying upgrades to get those seats.

Safety is huge for me. Hence why Colombia or Brazil or something doesn’t really interest me.

Would enjoy some dates while on vacation. At the very least mingling with locals. I love meeting people from different countries.

Destinations I’m considering most:

Asia:
Usually prefer Asia. 

Have been to Japan 3x already. Over a month in Tokyo, couple weeks in Osaka. Have been to Yokohama, Kyoto, Nara, and Kyoto already. I could spend a year in Tokyo honestly. But also feel like I should go see more places which would be Hiroshima, Nagoya, or Hokkaido next, preference wise. I also am conversational in Japanese and have a friend I might be able to see a couple days there. It also feels like a waste to learn Japanese and then not go to Japan. But it also feels silly on the other hand to only ever go to Japan. Catch-22 I guess. 

Philippines. Beaches! Manila looks chaotic but fun. People seem insanely friendly. Cebu area couple be cool. I’ve kind of been scared off of the infrastructure there but I don’t think that’s a huge deal just sort of an annoyance.

Thailand. 3 messages a day sounds great. Easy metro in Bangkok. My favorite type of food is Thai. Amazing looking old ruins and temples. This was my first plan before I started second guessing myself.

Vietnam maybe. Love the food.

However, SE Asia in general is about 30-35 hours each way which one, is insane (Japan is only around 17) and two, I lose two to three days of vacation to planes and airports. I also don’t sleep almost at all on planes so i might be going days without more than a few hours sleep and lose even more vacation time.


Americas:

Costa Rica. Just seems nice. I don’t know.  But is two weeks here too much?

Europe:

Portugal. Have always wanted to go. Looks great. Affordable.  Great food. Also I have a friend who would come see me for a weekend here which could be fun. 

Spain? So many great cities to see like Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastien, etc.

Italy. Would love to see Tuscany and Rome and Naples. Pompeii is a major bucket list place. Great food. Bucket list in general it’s freaking Italy. The ruins, the museums, the food, the countryside, it all just seems great. Same friend that would meet me for a weekend in Portugal would also be willing to meet for a weekend in Italy. 

But I’ve been hemming and hawing for like six weeks now. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m annoying friends by constantly talking about it and changing my preference even multiple times a day. I just cannot make my mind up. So figured I’d get some advice from people that have done a lot of traveling on here. Or even people that haven’t and just have opinions! I have to make a decision soon or I’m gonna screw up and see nothing but way overpriced flights. I’m already getting close to that I feel like.

I’m curious to know how others may be doing this. I feel like giving us the option to be remote but then not let us have the freedom that comes with it defeats the purpose a little bit! 

I do have a little black box that plugs into my monitor (not sure of what to call it lol).. is there a smaller more portable screen I can buy and plug that into? It’s a Dell! 

Please let me know if you need me to clarify anything further!! Thank you! ",1727643013.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

t3_1fsmw2g,What to do with about three extra weeks in SE Asia?,"I am going to be solo backpacking around SEA from January to April, starting by looping northern Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. I'll be getting back to Bangkok in mid March and then I'll have about 4 weeks before I fly to New Delhi (from wherever I end up at)

I was initially planning to go down to Phuket briefly to check out Khao Sok for a few days and then use Koh Lanta as my base to check out the Thai islands for about 10 days since Phuket just doesn't sound like my thing. Afterwards I would go to Singapore for a few days and then Malaysia for just under 2 weeks.

However, Western Malaysia is supposed to be super wet in April and I've already been to jungles in central America and will in Vietnam and Thailand as well, so I don't know if it will be worth it. I'm also not sure if there will be enough to do without breaking the bank to spend 10 days on Koh Lanta, so I may have anywhere from 8-16 extra days to do something that is a cheap plane ride from Phuket/Singapore/KL.

I'm currently only going to be spending about 7/8 days in Cambodia between Siem Reap + PP and their surroundings, so I could theoretically add some time here. I'm also interested in Bali (less so after hearing about how touristy it is), eastern Malaysia, anywhere I can climb big mountains without having to pay for a guide, nice beaches (preferably with  waves of like 3-6ft, but I'm happy with anything)

Any recommendations for places to go or things to check out?

Would Teman Negara/Cameron Highlands be worth it when wet? Would 2/3 weeks of (cheaper) islands get boring? Any advice would be appreciated!",1727668777.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

I might do a 1-2 day layover in Japan on the way back, or just fly from Mumbai to San Francisco directly. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed at the thought of either.

t3_1fs9ju6,Visiting Miami from Ireland at the End of October – Any Tips/Suggestions for My 6-Day Itinerary?,"\*\*Dia duit mo chairde!\*\* (That's ""Hello my friends!"" in Irish)

As the title suggests, I will visit your fine city at the end of October. I'm really looking forward to the trip as it will be my first time in Miami, albeit I've been to Florida (Daytona, Tampa and Orlando) when I was younger.

Although there's a small group of us travelling, we each arrive on different days, which has given me plenty of time in advance to draw up a plan of things I'd like to see and do. I've also booked some activities in advance.

If you'd be so kind, I'd like the people of this subreddit to review my itinerary, offer some suggestions of things I should add or remove, provide some general advice about the city and overall, provide some constructive feedback. This trip wasn't cheap, and Miami is a city I've always wanted to see, so I want to ensure it goes as well as possible! The primary reason I'm travelling is to see my favourite NFL team (The Arizona Cardinals) take on your Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.

I've reviewed some tourism posts within this subreddit over the past few months and have also come across some fantastic suggestions from users, so thank you for that!

Below, I'll try and go into as much detail as possible regarding what I plan to do over the six days. Please also forgive me in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors I may have mistyped. I've been reviewing this post for about an hour to make sure it's perfect (This is my third read-through..). Anyway, I hope this post doesn't end up too long, boring or deleted by the Mods. So without further ado, please see below:

# Day 1 - Coral Gables

I arrive at Miami International Airport at 5:30 PM and will have to go through immigration. I hope this doesn't take too long! From there, I plan to take an Uber or Lyft to my accommodation. This should only take about 15-20 minutes according to Google Maps.

Once checked into my hotel in West Flagler, the plan is to take an Uber or Lyft to the Coral Gables area to explore some bars. Clubbing isn't my scene, so dive bars where I can watch sports and talk to people are right up my street. (Is this called a 'Dive bar?')

I'm going to a bar called... ""The Bar"" followed by John Martin's Irish bar. If I have the time, I might go to Tap42 bar. I also think I'll stick to bottles of beer while in Miami, as I don't want to end up a sloppy drunk. I like Miller and Bud Light, which I think most bars in the city provide.

After, It's another Uber/Lyft to Se7as bar, which looks like great fun according to Google. Since I'm Irish, I then plan to visit Duffy's Tavern - which looks like such a chill spot.

And that's about as exciting as Day 1 gets! It will probably be after 7 PM by the time I get to leave the hotel, and I'll probably be tired after travelling by air all day. As for food, I'll eat in one or two of the bars.

# Day 2 -Little Havana and Downtown

If I've time, I'll visit a grocery store to pick up a few snacks. The hotel provides plenty, but I'll still make the visit for a basic shop.

I'll then head to Little Havana (I'll walk if I'm okay for time) as I've booked a Walking Tour which embraces you in Cuban Culture. It also brings you to places where Cuban Cigars are made, Cuban Food and a lesson on some historic Cuban sites. Looking forward to it!

Once this is done. I might stick around the neighbourhood to explore it a little more, but eventually, I need to get to the Downtown (I'll most likely walk) area as I've booked a Cruise from Sunset to darkness. This should last about an hour.

Once done, I'll explore downtown. I've noted that I should visit Over/Under, Mama Tried and The Lost Boy venues for a drink and some food. Thankfully these are located near to each other.

Once tired, it's an Uber/Lyft home.

# Day 3 - Wynwood, Biscayne Bay and Miami vs FSU in Hard Rock

Uber/Lyft again, this time to see the Wynwood walls. I booked a tour for about $15 and it takes about an hour. Looking forward to it! I had considered buying a ticket for the Buggy Tour, but it was $50, maybe it's worth it?

I'll then visit Gramps Bar for a bite to eat and a bottle of beer.

Walk to the Museum of Hip-Hop. I'm a big Hip-Hop fan, so getting to visit this should be great! I haven't bought a ticket yet, I think it's about $15. I'm also considering visiting the Museum of Graffiti. I'm undecided since the walls will already contain plenty of artwork.

Uber/Lyft to Biscayne Bay and visit Flannigans, which I know is a meme on this Subreddit. I think it's the Rib Rolls I have to try. Anyway, I'll watch the NCAAF games while I'm there as it's not too far from Hard Rock Stadium and have a beer or two.

Uber/Lyft to the stadium. I'm banking on this game being a late kickoff, but FSU doesn't look good at all, and the Miami Hurricanes do. I've a feeling it may be a 3:30 PM kickoff which means I'll have to alter my plans for the day entirely. My seat is at Midfield, in the nose bleeds, but close to the front of the section. It's the Hurricanes' sideline, so no sun issues regardless of kick-off time.

I was at the Georgia Tech and FSU game in Dublin, Ireland and purchased an FSU T-shirt. It's Irish branded and has the team's logo, will I be okay wearing this T-shirt or will it cause trouble? I'm hoping it'll be a conversation starter with people on the day. I'm looking forward to seeing the Miami team, the QB Cam Ward has impressed me over the past 2 weeks.

Once the game is done, I'll have to head back to the hotel. This might be an issue of traffic, but I have an early start on Sunday.

# Day 4 - Dolphins vs Cardinals in Hard Rock

It's an Uber/Lyft to the Miami Dolphins Tailgate near the stadium. A friend who lives there has kindly invited us along. This means I'll need to be there from around 10 AM to 10:30 AM.

Meet my buddies at the tailgate, enjoy it and enter the stadium for the game.

Here's the kicker, I'm on the side where the sun beams down. I read so much advice that I shouldn't do this, but I got a great offer on a seat at midfield so close to the field and I'm on the Cardinal sideline. Other options were in Row Z of the Dolphin sideline and cost more money. I am not sitting with my buddies, but that's okay.

After the game, the evening is wide open. I'm going to do whatever my friends want to do, which means probably going to Mid-Beach or South Beach to watch the evening games in a bar. This will be costly, but it's only one evening.

When it's home time, Uber/Lyft of course.

# Day 5 - South, Mid and North Beach, followed by Heat vs Pistons

When I decide to crawl out of bed with probably a hangover, I plan to visit the island. I plan to start from the bottom (South Pointe Park) and walk northwards for the day. Google Maps says this is doable in a few hours, but I have until 7 PM with pit stops here and there, so I'm in no hurry.

Maybe I'll rent a bike to explore South Pointe Park?

So, I've drawn up a list of sights I should see along the way on my walk, starting south and moving north, please see below:

1. South Pointe Park
2. Visit Ted's Hideaway
3. Miami Beach Boardwalk
4. Ocean Drive and Art Deco
5. Flamingo/Hummus
6. Mac's Club Deuce
7. Espanola Way
8. The Abbey Bar
9. Collins Avenue
10. Holocaust Memorial
11. Sunset Harbour (Maybe?)
12. Lost Weekend Bar (Maybe?)

Once that is all said and done, it's an Uber/Lyft to the Kaseya Arena for the Miami Heat and Detroit Pistons game. I'm sat pretty high up and far back, but hopefully I enjoy the game. Basketball is a sport I loved when I was younger, I even supported the Heat because Dwayne Wade was my favourite player, so it's a pleasure to get to see the team, live!

After that, it's home to bed.

# Day 6 - Advice Needed, No plans made as of yet

I'm considering either travelling to Fort Lauderdale or to the Miami Everglades, but honestly I am totally undecided. I'm open to any other suggestions from you locals, as well!

The Everglades was my original plan, but 2 people have told me it wasn't that good. I'd be doing the typical tourist thing - boat ride, a wildlife show etc.

Fort Lauderdale looks fabulous from the pictures I've seen online. I will have to travel there by train, though. When there, I think I'll do a cruise which lasts an hour or two.

# Day 7 - Hop on/Hop off Bus Tour, Airport and Home to Ireland

I've decided on going with the bus tour so I can take in the sights one final time and stop off at some places which I never got to see over the 6 days. I'm lucky that my bag will be stored away somewhere safe, so I won't need to worry about it until it's time to go to the airport.

My flight is at 10PM, so I have the entire day to see everything one final time.

# Other things I feel I should add

I've stumbled upon a list (Sorry, I've saved this post as a draft twice now) I curated with questions I'd like to ask locals. Please see below:

* What food should I get in Flannigan's? Rib Rolls or something else?
* I'm not a big beach guy, meaning I won't be going swimming. However, I will of course take a trip to the beach for the sights, to take photographs and all that.
* I wouldn't mind trying Argentinian food. Are there any good spots? I don't want to break the bank either, just try some Argentinian beef!
* Could someone recommend a good sports store? Basically, a big store which sells MLB, NHL, MLS and to a lesser extent NFL merchandise but not limited to Miami based teams... If such a place even exists!

I really can't think of what else to add right now. I just want to make sure I get this post to be right (Please don't delete AutoBot..). I'm not stressing about the trip or anything, I'm just looking to make sure I see/do as much as I can while there. If you've made it this far into the post, I sincerely thank you for reading and hopefully you have some feedback for me.

Looking forward to visiting!",1727630465.0,2024-10-08 12:04:45

t3_1fs51lk,1 week in Peru: MP and Manu NP? Budget-friendly trip,"Husband and I have one week in Peru. I'll be in Tambopata for work for a week, and then we're meeting in Cusco and have a week together. We wanted to see Machu Picchu and Manu National Park (since I'll already have been in Tambopata region and he really wants to see the Amazon.)

We will meet at Cusco airport around 15:00 on 9 November, and then we have a flight back to Lima at 18:45 on 16 November (to then depart back to the US). Neither of us will be checking any bags; just carry-on size (\~40L) backpacks.

Some folks from my work thing are booking a Cusco - MP - Cusco all in one day tour, but at $400 USD pp, it felt pretty steep to us. I'm hoping to put together a more budget-friendly plan.

Does it make sense to:

* Book ahead and take the 16:30 Bus + Train from Wanchaq to Aguascalientes (""Machu Picchu station"") on 9 November ($52pp)

* Book a ho(s)tel in AC for 9 Nov
* Try and find a guide in AC on the day, to take us up to MP on Circuit 2 on 10 November
* Book transit ahead and go back to Cusco on 10 November
* Book accommodation in Cusco for 10 November
* Try and find a tour, in Cusco, on 11 November to take us to Manu, likely leaving in the early AM 12 November and returning 15 November?

The last one is notable for being about $200 cheaper pp than most of the rest of them, which is great but also curious...

t3_1fsd0za,Transfer time for LAX,"Hello,

In a few months, I will be flying internationally for the first time. On December 28th, I will be flying out of SMF and into LAX with my brother via Southwest to transfer to terminal 7 and leave LAX on my international flight.

My SMF -&gt; LAX Flight is scheduled to be from 6:45AM to 8:20AM, to which then my second flight leaves at 11:30AM. These two flights are booked on separate tickets, and in every other connection I have more than enough time to transfer without any worry (the LAX to SMF return flight has a 6+ hour layover).

I'm aware that the terminal I would be arriving in LAX at, Southwest, is at the opposite side of where the United terminal lies, and that I additionally will need to collect and recheck baggage in my 3 hour window. Regardless, is this enough time to make it to my flight?

If I estimate that the flight is \~40 minutes delayed (meaning I am off the plane around 9AM), baggage collection takes \~30 minutes, and we take the \~15 minute walk outside of the airport to cross straight from Southwest to the United terminal (Both my brother and I are able to walk pretty quickly, there's no concern over exhaustion or anything), that would get us depositing luggage around 10AM (+15 minutes accounting for anything else). Then, we would have to get through security and be at the terminal within the remaining time.

I understand that this is a pretty optimistic timeline, and it should also be considered both that this will be early/late morning as well as extremely close to New Years where travel is likely going to be more frequent.

t3_1fsbec6,How far in advance for Eurotar tickets,"Hey everybody.

My wife and I are travelling to Europe in late October, early November. Starting in Paris then heading up to Brussels and finally working our way to Amsterdam with a few stops along the way.

We're planning on taking Eurostar from Paris to Brussels and maybe from Antwerp to Rotterdam and then the regional trains for everything else.

I'm assuming we can get tickets for the regional trains day of. Is that a safe bet?

My question is, how far in advance do I have to get the Eurostar tickets? Is that something I can also pretty much always get right before the desired train or should I book those soon?

To me Paris is a clean city. I come from south America and there definitely the city is dirty and smells bad, but Paris was just normal for a metropolitan city. 
I understand French people have their way of being. Politeness is KEY. Always I was arriving in places speaking in my limited french ""bonjour, si vous plais je vous prendre.."" and people would even help me by correcting when I say something wrong. But always in a kind way they would do that, smiling and attentive.

The most of the county is mountainous and you can even go skiing and experience beautiful views. Country is also full of beautiful waterfalls and historical landmarks and some of them are thousands of years old. Lebanon is the most religiously diverse country in Middle east and they have 18 oficially recognized religious sects. Local food was also delicious especially manakish and kibbeh.

t3_1fz3sm7,Would you rather a group trip or just travel with your partner?,"Recently my (M30) GF(F32) and I did a trip to europe with our 2 closest friends (F31 M33 who arent dating each other). 

My GF and I had done a europe trip last year (2023) just us 2 and it went amazing (we were FwB when it started and when it ended we decided to date). We never fought and the trip was very hectic. This year we decided that maybe it might be nice if we each invited our closest friend. We didnt know what to expect for the 2024 trip but F31 and M33 are our closest friends and we have done smaller trips with them and have enjoyed it. The 2024 trip was a success with a few smaller inconveniences. Basically my GF and I felt F31 and M33 werent as compatible of travel buddies as we thought theyd be for a trip like this. Alot of minor things like they would wake up late while my GF and I wanted to attack the day early. it was a roadtrip so it was hard to just leave them at the house if we were doing a day trip an hour away and we felt like their parents waking them up. Sometimes we had to wait an extra hour or 2 for them. One day my GF felt she had to take care of F31 after she went out all night drinking and was not feeling good the next day. My GF went out with us the next day but then left early after it started to rain to check up on F31 and stayed in all day and then regretted not being able to see the city that day as it was our only chance to see the city. 

After the trip my GF and I discussed how we felt inviting others and compared it to our 2023 trip. We both agreed that it was more fun when it was just us and agreed if we do one next year it would be just us 2.  It juts seems her and I are just compatible when travelling and we dont feel the need to have to entertain or adjust to others. Most of my friends though arent that compatible travellers with their partners. Like they'd rather do a boys trip (or a group trip) and the boys go one side and the girls go the other. Its made me wonder how common it is for partners to enjoy trips (especially long trips) just when its the two of them.

t3_1fy6r62,"A week's long trip to Iceland, September 2024","For a while now I wanted to go to Iceland, and finally did it last month, and I have enjoyed it so much!

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much). 

The pictures, in order, are from: Seljalandsfoss, Solheimajokull *2, Vik, Reynisfjara beach, Selvallafoss, Northern Lights in a place close to Hvammsvik, Kirkjufell, Londrangar, Budakirkja, Gulfoss, Kerid Crater, Geysir, Reykjavik and Hvammsvik. ",1728305213.0,2024-10-08 18:13:24
t3_1fza192,"What are some of your favourite parts of your country to travel, and why? ","I’ve become a happy domestic traveller for various reasons— including personal preference at this stage in life.

So I’ve been wondering— is there any part of your country that is a favourite to you for travelling, and why? 

For me it’s hard to choose one, so it would be a toss-up between Yorkshire or the West Country in England (inc. Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall). 

I love visiting Yorkshire for its many friendly, multicultural and creative communities, the world-class curries and range of other foods, and nature. Woodlands (tree cover is really low in Britain, sadly), purple heather moors, greenery, cosy towns, beautiful skies, and probably the most crisp air in the country. Also iconic architecture, like Whitby Abbey and the Piece Hall. 

The West Country is another favourite. Granite sea cliffs, pristine white and red-sand beaches, glittering turquoise seas. The plants can be so fragrant - like honeysuckle, dog roses, and wild garlic. 

All in all, I like Yorkshire as it rolls some of England’s best qualities into one place: diversity, heritage, nature, community character, etc. And the West Country is best for my aroma and colour therapy. 🩵🤍🩷💚💜

t3_1fz6a3d,Feedback on 3-week Mexico itinerary,"Hi there - my SO and I are visiting Mexico from mid Nov to early Dec. We will be there for just over 3 weeks, which hopefully gives us enough time to explore 2-3 regions and have a good variety of experiences (cities, beaches, etc.). This is our high-level itinerary so far:

**Days 1-5: Mexico City**

* Including day trip to Teotihuacán

**Days 5-8: Bacalar** (fly to Chetumal from Mexico City, then bus to Bacalar)

**Days 8-11: Valladodid** (ADO bus from Bacalar)

* Including day trips to Chichén Itzá/Rosalia Chay Chuc/cenotes)

**Days 11-14: Merida** (ADO bus from Valladodid)

* Including day trips to Uxmal/Ek-Balam/cenotes

**Days 14-17: Oaxaca City** (fly from Merida)

* Including day trips to a mezcalería/Monte Albán/Hierve el Agua/Pueblos Mancomunados

**Days 17-21: Puerto Escondido** (ADO bus from Oaxaca)

* Including day trips to Mazunte/Zipolite/Chacahua National Park

**Days 21-23: Mexico City**

Have done quite a lot of research but wanted to check with those in the know if this itinerary makes sense or if we've missed anything! Some specific notes/questions:

* We've booked flights in and out of Mexico City (from Europe), besides that pretty open so far
* Have already cut a few places out (e.g. Puebla/Cholula) so the trip feels relaxing, but is this still too much? Or anything amazing missing?
* Don't plan to hire a car - happy to do it, but it doesn't seem necessary for the places we're visiting?
* We like exploring cities and walking (museums, markets, etc.), LOVE food and drink, and appreciate natural beauty
* Want some beach time but not into all-inclusive resorts/sleepy towns with nothing else to do - so thought Puerto Escondido/Bacalar were good options (aware Bacalar is not a beach, but think it counts as lazing by the water vibes)
* For beach we also considered Holbox (but were put off by bad reviews of sewage problems/flooding, power outages, mosquitoes, bad service, etc.) and Isla Mujeres/Cozumel (but hear they are too touristy/similar to Cancun/Tulum) - any other perspectives on this?
* Neither of us are particularly into archaeology/visiting ruins - does this mean we have too much time in Merida/Valladolid? Thinking we might just visit 1 or 2 of Chichén Itzá/Uxmal/Ek Balam and not all of them (similarly with the cenotes)
* We also briefly considered doing Jalisco (Guadalajara, Tequila, Puerto Vallarta, etc.) instead of Yucatan

t3_1fz3gcx,Grand Canyon Sept. 2025 and bringing 65 year old dad - Airports and Duration Questions,"Hi - So, I've done most but not all of my homework, including the NPS site, \~2 dozen reddit posts and a few YT videos.  I'm looking for some additional guidance on optimizing our trip and making sure that we are not forced to rush around.

**Trip Objective and Background:**   
GC has always been on my dad's list, we were initially planning to do the 3day river trip offered by Western Expeditions, but I'm too concerned with my dad's health to put us in a position like that. He's not obese, but he has a heart condition and we just do not want to put ourselves in that type of situation if we can avoid it.   
  
The objective is to optimize for shorter, less strenuous hikes, helicopter tours, mule rides and other activities where the physical activity is limited in time (say &lt;3hours) and in strain (limited elevation gain, dicey pathways, etc).  We are very much into scenic drives, I'm not concerned with the 4-5 hour drive between the SR and NR, for example.  If there are opportunities for catch &amp; release fly fishing, even better.

We are very interested in Phoenix, Sedona, Flagstaff and even Page.  Vegas is less of a thing for us, but if it makes sense to fly in/out of Vegas, then so be it.  We fully intend on renting a car, if that isn't obvious.  We don't really drink but we very much enjoy a good meal, so I'd prioritize the towns/cities offering more in the way of food over say bars and nightlife.

I realize that there are other opportunities for parks, such as heading into Utah, and while that is certainly appealing my main goal is to get my dad to see the GC.

**Trip Dates and Duration:**   
We are targeting early September 2025, we are flexible and can bring in to August but September is preferred.  We'd like to stick to 3-4 days, say we land on a Thursday morning and then fly out on a Sunday evening.

**Accommodations:**   
Traditional lodging but we are certainly interested in a non-primitive camping option, if it makes sense.   

**The information I am most interested in right now:**  
1) Given the above, what is the most ideal flight plan, where to fly into, where to fly out of?  Currently thinking fly in to Vegas, then depart from Phoenix.  Not opposed to using the same airport if it makes more sense.  
  
2) Should we plan for 3 nights, 4 days (Thur, Fri, Sat night, leave Sunday afternoon)? Is this enough time given our objectives?  Say 2 nights in/around the canyon with the remainder spread between the other locations (Sedona, Flagstaff, etc...)

3) Is there a compelling reason to go towards end of Aug, early Sept versus end of Sept?

A couple years ago we went to the Oregon coast and stayed in a sleepy beach town and it was the perfect vacation for us because there was lots of hikes and it also wasn't too crowded.

Is the above feasible in 26 days and am I missing anything paramount? I’d love to spend as much time as I can in Mexico City. 

I’ll meet a friend in Cancun and then resume southwards towards Belize etc. 

Cheers!  ",1728422080.0,2024-10-08 18:13:24
t3_1fzamcm,USA - Looking for recommendations for early Dec travel with my parents,"My parents are slightly old, but they love to walk, and want to spend time with my 1.5 yr old daughter. I have a week off in early Dec, and I thought we'd do a fun trip together. 

I would love any recommendations, but here are some things to help narrow down -

* They've been to CA, WA, FL, VT, and Oregon quite a few times, so would prefer something else
* They prefer smaller towns over very big cities
* They are not big fans of snow. Chilly weather is fine, but if there's a high likelihood of snow, we'll probably avoid that. I know this limits us to mostly the South
* Small drives (2-3 hours) is ok, but we wouldn't want our trip to be very drive focussed (think: Pacific Coast highway). The toddler doesn't do well in cars
* We prefer to keep it domestic

I was initially thinking NC or GA, but Google generally recommends going there before Thanksgiving to get the best chance to see fall colors.

Thank you for any recommendations!",1728421561.0,2024-10-08 18:13:24

t3_1fz9oge,La Paz to Uyuni - Bus or Flight?,"Hello!

I'm a relatively young woman (F26) and I want to find a safe way to go to Uyuni for a day. I will be in La Paz, and I have 3 full days/2 nights to go Uyuni.

I'm considering either to fly to Uyuni and book a day tour to see the salt flats, or take an overnight bus but I have a few concerns with either method:

* Safety: Obviously the primary concern here, I'm not too worried about the airport, but more so being at the bus stop at night time, taxis to get to the bus stop in the evening etc.
* Flight delays: Has anyone done the flight and missed their salt flats tour or just been waiting too long?
* Luggage: Uyuni will be the last thing I do on my trip to South America, and I do presume I will have a decent amount of luggage (nothing too crazy but a regular luggage bag + backpack). I'll be starting in La Paz, and I hope to finish there too. I won't be at the same hotel for start/end but I can contact the hotel to hopefully hold a decent amount of my belongings.
* Time: I'd be nice to have a bit more time in La Paz, unless it is a bit dry and not much to do, I'd probably want a bit more of time there, than Uyuni. Or is it worth taking a flight one day to Uyuni, another to Sucre/Cochabamba, and then back to La Paz?

t3_1fz94d5,37M Solo Traveller from the UK Seeking Advice for US Trip,"Hey everyone, I've solo travelled a lot around Europe and Asia, but now I'm planning my first solo trip to the US and would love some advice as I'm utterly clueless about the country! I'll be traveling for 17 days in January 2025 and hitting three main spots: New York, New Orleans, and Puerto Rico. Budget is quite relaxed but obviously don't want to go crazy, what I priced up in this post came to about $2500 for flights and accommodation.

* New York: A no brainer really, there's everything to do here, plus it’s where most of the cheapest UK flights land. I’ll spend 5 nights here.
* New Orleans: Always been on my list, I'm not totally sure why, possibly the mix of good food, music, and unique colonial architecture / culture. It's somewhere I've always wanted to go, maybe just for that Gumbo. Another 5 nights.
* Puerto Rico: For winter sun and the Spanish-American cultural blend, the rest of the trip will be quite active, so this feels like a nice way to relax before heading home; 5 nights here to finish.

Here’s where I could use some help: I’d like to visit a smaller, less touristy (for Brits anyway) city for 2 nights between New York and New Orleans. Initially, I thought of something down the East Coast, but then I came across Portland, Maine. As a bearded man in his thirties, the cliché rings true and I'm big into craft beer, and as a big NEIPA drinker, going to New England really appeals to me. I hear Portland has 27 breweries in the city, and will also have that smaller city vibe, so I think I'd really enjoy it there. However, it’s a bit tricky to reach and expensive for just two nights. So the question, Is it worth it, or would you suggest elsewhere?

About me: I’m an extroverted introverted, so really enjoy meeting locals and fellow travellers alike when my social battery allows it, so I’ll look for social accommodations and group activities like walking tours or pub crawls when in the bigger cities, are these a thing in NYC/NO? I live for good coffee, good food and good beer, and seek them out everywhere I go, I'm expecting to be very happy in America in this regard. I'm also a metalhead, and have always been curious about the American metalcore scene, would love to find some bars along the way that align with that, maybe thats more likely in NYC? Oh, and I’d love to see an NHL game whilst here! I see Rangers vs. Blue Jackets is on when I'm planning to be in town, anyone know how hard it is to get a ticket for this?

Thanks for reading this far, none of this is set in stone, so any recommendations, critiques, or advice would be hugely appreciated! Oh, and finally, how welcoming is the US for British solo travellers, and am I going to have fun?",1728417735.0,2024-10-08 18:13:24
t3_1fz7ieu,Patagonia super post Part 1 – itinerary + reviews from Bariloche and la ruta de los 7 lagos,"Hi all,

I spent a month in Patagonia during Argentina's summer, and I would like to share some thoughts, both to record my own feelings but also to potentially help others trip planning. My ideal travel style is to take my sweet time in new places, in life, to get to know them better than I would just breezing through, and I was able to set up my world this year to be able to travel in this way. If you're similar, you might get something out of what's written below.

Part 1 is on the area around Bariloche. Part 2 (or more?) will address El Bolsón, El Chaltén, and El Calafate.

In general, there's lots of blog posts I read about the smallest amount of time you can ""do,"" say, the route of the 7 lakes in, but if you are bumming around the country for a while, give yourself as much time as possible. For me, one month in Patagonia was not enough. I left some crumbs on the floor (which is totally ok, anti-conquistador mentality, just felt a bit harried/frustrated at the time...I suppose I will just have to go back some day :) more on what I would go back for later). Also remember to budget in days to do laundry, run errands, walk around town, do souvenir shopping, rain check activities, etc. I did not, because I am stupid/a robot/not in love with the practical side of life and tend to forget about my body and how I have to take care of it! Don't be me! Once you've budgeted an approximate amount of days for the things you'd like to do in any one place, I'd suggest adding more to that if you can.

Below is my initial itinerary, annotated to reflect how it changed as well as how I would change it further in ways I was unable to (because of tickets bought in advance to save money, etc.) to make it more relaxing, fun, and thorough. Used AllTrails extensively and Wikiloc sometimes to stay on track.

**Bold** = completed  
~~Strikethrough~~ = changed  
*Italics* = thotz  
✨ = recommend  
\[ \] = if I want to specify the part of what I did that I am recommending

# Bariloche

**Day 1** – **arrive in Bariloche, buy snacks/food, settle**

**Day 2** – **Cerro Bella Vista + Goye** **✨**  
*chill warmup hike, nice views, though Cerro Goye maybe not as interesting after Cerro Bella Vista (plus infested with tábanos on the sunny day I was lucky to go). I went up from Colonia Suiza to Cerro Bella Vista first, then Cerro Goye, then backtracked and went down the same route I came up, making it out-and-back rather than a loop to keep it chill. The descent from Goye I didn't do is supposed to be a little more intense, and while I can manage intense I didn't want that for my first day. Note via bus you can only take 13B/10B around 8:30am or 13A every hour starting from 9:30am, so make sure to be where you gotta be at those times if you want an early start.*

**Day 3** – recovery day with **Sendero Los Arrayanes &gt; Lago Escondido &gt; Villa Tacul** **✨**or ~~Playa Muñoz~~  
*chose over Playa Muñoz because was a colder, windier day, though Play Muñoz might have been more sheltered from the wind. Usually not very into these popular, flat hikes, but this was pretty cool. You get to see some arrayanes, more than a few nice places to swim (I got in a couple of times despite the wind, particularly at Mirador Lago Moreno, where the rocky entry point was just too enticing, and the playa to the east of Playa Villa Tracul, because it was sheltered from the wind and hotter), plus the dope view from Cerro Llao Llao of Cerro López. Recommend.*

**Day 4** – ~~Bahía López &gt; Pico Turista &gt; Cerro Bailey Willis &gt; Refugio Laguna Negra~~ **Sendero Laguna Negra from Colonia Suiza to Refugio Laguna Negra**, with a side trip after dropping off stuff to **Cerro Bailey Willis ✨**  
*after seeing an imposing Cerro López the day before on my hike and consulting with my airbnb host, who has lived in the area for over 20 years, I changed my initial plans. Apparently, and as I later found out, the* *Bahía López to Cerro López via Sendero Palotinos* *is pretty heavy, and I would not recommend with a large backpack! Most people doing this back around the way route to Laguna Negra go up Camino al Refugio López, maybe spend a night there or camping nearby first, and then go through Pico Turista and Cerro Bailey Willis on way to spending a night at Refugio Laguna Negra, so I might suggest that (adds a night/day), though the rocky ridge atop Cerro Bailey Willis was not super chill either. Therefore, unless you're experienced I again would not suggest doing with a heavy backpack. The direct trail to Laguna Negra from Colonia Suiza was also LOVELY, btw, so I am glad I did it in the end. The extra 3 hours out-and-back to Cerro Bailey Willis sans backpack was also grrreat. Alone on the peak I had an up close encounter with my first juvenile condor...a highlight. The refugio is one of the older ones and smaller, but the food was good and I liked the intimate atmosphere.*

**Day 5** – ~~go back ""short way"" via Camino al Refugio López. More grocery shopping +/or swimming~~ headed down again via **Sendero Laguna Negra**  
*add a day for booking transport to Pampa Linda and running some errands to spend less money over there. Maybe could also do Playa Muñoz or Playa del Moreno sin viento/Playa del viento if you get that shit done in the morning of the extra day (or even add a second day to chill at one of those beaches).*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days\~\~\~\~\~

**Day 6** – **Pampa Linda** in morning, then **\[Saltillo Las Nalcas✨\], Ventisquero Negro, Mirador de la Garganta del Diablo**, ~~and maybe Mirador Este Glaciar Castaño Overa +/or Cerro Volcánico Este if have time~~  
*walked to Saltillo Las Nalcas from the albergue, then hitchhiked to Ventisquero Negro (the way there is a road for vehicles anyway, not really a trail, and hot and sunny and infested with tábanos), walked to Garganta del Diablo (again, road, but at least more shaded), and hitchhiked back to the albergue. My fave was Saltillo Las Nalcas, where I got in under the fall and then also later that evening went swimming in the glacial creeks with a great view of Cerro Tronador in the background. Ventisquero Negro and Garganta del Diablo were more touristy/groomed, though I guess worth it, kind of why not, if you're in the area. I do wish I had another day or two so I could do the* [*Mirador Este Glaciar Castaño Overa*](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/argentina/rio-negro/miradores-glaciar-castano-overo-y-ventisquero-negro?u=i&amp;sh=scsmqc) *and* [*Cerro Volcánico Este*](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/argentina/rio-negro/cerro-volcanico-este?u=i&amp;sh=scsmqc)*, and I also really liked the albergue, so worth staying in a couple more days to do that if you can.*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days\~\~\~\~\~

**Day 7** – **Refugio Otto Meiling + \[Sendero Glaciar Castaño Overa✨\]**  
*did as an out-and-back day hike. At the time, the nearly 18miles and not sure how much elevation gain was a lot for me, though later on in the trip I hiked 24mi, so w/e idk. The short add-on to the lower mirador was worth it, really beautiful (light for photos is better early in the day FYI, but I went on the way back in the afternoon and it was still stunning, just backlit), and there are some views at the top that are dope, plus saw lots of condors up there, but the trail itself most of the way is made more for horses, wide, dusty, flat, uninteresting and duh full of tábanos. I'm glad I did it, but I don't really know if it's necessary to go all the way to the refugio unless you're staying there. I grabbed lunch and rested for a bit, so that was chill, but it's not, like, the best hike I've done in my life. Maybe just go to the point where you can see the waterfalls coming off the glacier and the huge valley up top? Bring lunch? Up in the air in terms of recommending it or not. Not sure I would even recommend splitting it up into two days and spending the night at the refugio (though the entire staff was made up of women, which is v cool). Jury's out. (Also, FYI, met some people at the hostel in Pampa Linda who walked over the glacier, doing a Pampa Linda &gt; Ilón &gt; Rocca &gt; Meiling &gt; Pampa Linda loop, and they said I was smart to skip this option, but if it's something that appeals, go for it)*

**Day 8** – **Refugio Ilón from Pampa Linda + \[Cerro Capitan✨\]**  
*first day of 3 day point to point hike to Lago Frías. Trail to the refugio is kind of par for the course for the area, though it did seem like there were slightly fewer horseflies, and it was less groomed than other paths (always a bonus in my books). Refugio itself was really nice – liked the buildings and the lake that it's on. I went in the water a little too late in the day for it to be warm but can definitely see dipping in around midday being appealing. Dropped my stuff in the hut after checking in and high-tailed it up to Cerro Capitán. I was only interested in this at first because I was upset (due to financial limitations/my desire to not hire a guide and instead do everything myself that I could) that I wasn't going to get to do La Travesía de las 5 Lagunas. Someone who reviewed that hike had mentioned Laguna Jujuy being their favourite lake on the hike, so I thought that if I couldn't do the whole thing at least I could check out Jujuy from Ilón. Really glad I did! Instead of abajando-ing down to the lake and subiendo-ing back up, I just hung out on/explored the top. There's a great view of Tronador as well as Volcán Osorno all the way in Chile (if you're there on a clear day like I was), plus what you look at from Mirador del Doctor, and more from up there. But the way up/down is nothing to sneeze at either. Beautiful alpine flowers next to flowing streams, lots of different birds including bandurrias/black-faced ibis, which have a pretty wild birdcall, not to mention the fact I was entirely alone. So good.*

**Day 9 – Refugio Ilón to Refugio Rocca, including Mirador Del Doctor**  
*this was described as rough in lots of reviews/guides, and they were accurate. In that, with my full backpack, I was definitely tired and sore by the end. Only 11mi and 3000ft elevation gain, but all the up-and-down and terrain had me reeling. Was occasionally difficult to find the trail, even with markings from the park service, though I guess I prefer that to wide open paths. The mirador was nice, but you likely will not be alone, and I was more blown away by Cerro Capitán the afternoon before, though I would not skip the mirador if you're already all the way out there doing this trail – it's not too long/tough of an addition (I left my pack at the fork). Saw a Magellanic woodpecker and some other cool birdies in there,  met some cool people along the way, and there were a few spots to blast my exhausted footsies with cold mountain water, but was v happy to arrive at Rocca. Which is more built-out and busier and expensive than the other refugios I stayed at. If you're just gonna stay at one refugio this would not be my personal choice, but it did have creature comforts like showers so if that's your jam, go for it. Also absolutely necessary resting point on this 3 day trek.*

**Day 10 – Refugio Rocca to Lago Frías (part of Paso de las Nubes), Turisur ferry from Lago Frías to Puerto Pañuelo**  
*looking at the elevations, I thought this hike was gonna be easy peasy: mostly downhill, then a long flat section. DON'T BE ME! Leave as close to 8 or 8:30 as you can, because it's more time-intensive than it seems. Then it will be fun instead of stressful (will I make the boat? Won't I?), as there's more clambering than in other areas, different vegetation, different bugs, and lots of lovely streams to dip your toes in/some waterfalls. Booked the ferry in advance at the Turisur office in Bariloche, which I think is easiest – their website confused the shit out of me. After arriving back in Bariloche, I picked up a rental car I got for 4 days to do La Ruta de Los 7 Lagos and checked into my airbnb.*

**Day 11 – Drive to Villa La Angostura, boat from Bahía Brava to ""Puerto Arrayanes,"" tour around the bosque, walk back to Bahía Brava via Sendero Bosque de Arrayanes, including Miradores Bahía Mansa and Brazo Norte** ~~(on the way to Los Arrayanes National Park or after: Sendero Río Bonito, Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana, other beaches)~~  
*so prior to this point you can see that I've made recommendations for adjustments of 1-2 days, but this is where my time estimates really started to fail me. There is so, so much to see and do along the ruta, 4 days is really not enough if you're pretty sure you're NOT going to be making your way back to Patagonia any time soon. While I absolutely knew I would not be able to see everything of interest on this drive, and many spots on my list were definitely more suggestions/possibilities than hard plans/have-to-dos, I missed out on more than I would have liked to*. *For instance, just driving to Villa La Angostura, I saw tons of unmarked places with cars parked along the side of the road, where I would have stopped to investigate :p and swim if I'd left more time. Also the car rental company did not allow me to take my car to Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana because ""they're in Chile,"" despite the fact that the falls are actually not technically across the border in Chile, just past a border checkpoint. Such a bummer. But maybe if I'd had more time I could have found other adventurers, possibly Argentinos, or some kind of tour situation (eyeroll) with the ability to take transpo over there. So I would say something like:*  
\~\~\~1st day: drive leisurely to Villa La Angostura and check out swim spots along the way. If you have time in the afternoon (you should!) I'd do Sendero Río Bonito and chill on the beach it lets out onto (Playa La Escondida/Playa Río Bonito/Playa Publica) slash the other beaches nearby (Playa de las Aguas Calientes, Puerto Manzano)  
\~\~\~2nd day: Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana, and Playas on the way back (Playa La Aguada del Burro, Playa Escondida, Playa Lago Espejo)  
\~\~\~3rd day: Bosque de Arrayanes in the morning. Chill at Playa Lago Correntoso in the afternoon  
\~\~\~\~\~+2 days\~\~\~\~\~  
*As far as what I did get up to on my Day 11, I took the 3:45 ferry from Bahía Brava to the bosque. The schedule for boats from Bahía Brava (which take you along the outside of the peninsula) was slightly different than what I saw online (I thought the afternoon boat left at 3:15), but you should be able to find something to your liking from them or Bahía Mansa, and just swim at the beach while waiting. Also swam at the muelle/beach where the boat arrived, even though there are signs saying you're kinda not supposed to. But the sun was going down and I had to take my chances :). Tour was fine. Might have enjoyed the walk back along the peninsula more if I wasn't chasing the sunlight/sunset. Would say the first quarter leaving from the forest, where you can see more arrayanes outside of the boardwalked route, and the last quarter, where you can see more of the water, are the best. But the middle section is kind of basic, dusty, and flat, and I was a bit bored/tired. Head to Mirador Brazo Norte for the sunset (if you're there around that time), and Mirador Bahia Mansa any other time (pretty view of the water and boats, reminded me of Croatia)*

**Day 12 –** ~~Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana,~~ **✨Playa La Escondida/the beach by Río Bonito, Playa Lago Correntoso, \[Playa la Aguada del Burro\], Playita de Lago Espejo Chico,** ~~Sendero Cascada Ñivinco, Cascada Vuliñanco~~, **and creeks on the side of the road** on the way from **Villa La Angostura &gt; San Martín de Los Andes**  
*There was lots I enjoyed here, and I had a a decent amount of time at all of the stops listed, but it might be worth it to break it up further (following something like the suggested itinerary above, where you'd have visited Río Bonito, Playa la Aguada del Burro, Playa Lago Espejo, and Playa Lago Correntoso by this point already) so you could add (Lago Espejo Chico proper? didn't make it to the lake proper so can't say anything about it) Sendero Cascada Ñivinco at a reasonable hour (before 4 is much better – heat of the sun was gone when I got there on Day 13), and Cascada Vuliñanco (which I only ever saw from the road, didn't do the hike to it) today. As far as what I did do, LOVED Playa Río Bonito (cut out the walk to it because of all I wanted to try to squeeze in the day, but looked really cool and liked the small part of it closer to the beach I did, walking variably in the cool water and on the trail), Playa Lago Correntoso (water is so, so clear. Parking was a bit of a bitch but once I found it I stayed for hours because I was just in love. Plus there are places to jump/dive/drift at Río Correntoso), and Playita de Lago Espejo Chico (more like a creek situation. Flowing water to float down, and a tree to jump off of. Fun times). Playa la Aguada del Burro was less busy, which is always a plus, but given what I got used to on this day, was less impressive (water's murkier, etc.), and could definitely skip. There's also a beautiful river on the side of 40 (Río Pichi Traful?) I hopped into at some random place along the road and loved.*

**Day 13 – \[Playa de Yuco✨\],** ~~La Islita, Muelle Hua Hum, Pucará, Playa Quila Quina, and/or Pya Catritre on Lago Lácar,~~ **Playa Lago Hermoso,** ~~Cascadas del Rio Hermoso,~~ **dip in Lago Faulkner,** ~~Lago Escondido,~~ **\[Sendero Cascada Ñivinco✨\],** ~~y Playa de Lago Traful~~ on the way from **San Martín de los Andes &gt; Villa Traful**  
*As you can see, there was a bunch I missed out on closer to San Martín de los Andes (including a river area called Pozones de Caleufú about an hour from the town I didn't even bother trying to wedge into what I could see was becoming an uncomfortably tight schedule), which is also, from what I heard from most of the Argentinians I met, THE town preferred over Bariloche for hanging out in the north of Patagonia. I barely got to spend any time at all in town. So I would do something like*  
\~\~\~1st full day SMdlA: Pozones de Caleufú in morning/midday, hike La Islita in the later afternoon and stay for sunset  
\~\~\~2nd full day SMdlA: Playa de Yuco, then quick stop at Muelle Hua Hum on the way to Pucará  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-3 days (3rd day for errands, and/or other beaches)\~\~\~\~\~  
*in which case, on this, the day you leave SMdlA you could do Playa Quila Quina +/or Pya Catritre on the way out of town instead of drive all the way to Playa de Yuco and all the way back like I did, leaving more time for other stuff throughout the day. That being said, Playa de Yuco is a recommend. There are like 5 lil different beach areas to chill at. The more ""rugged"" Playas 4 and 5 had fewer people, but there were great swimming and jumping/diving spots all around. Playa Lago Hermoso seemed nice, but there was a strong wind coming from the west by the time I got there, so it was harder to enjoy. I stubbornly camped out there nonetheless, only to regret it later when getting to the Cascadas Ñivinco with no direct sun or when rolling into Villa Traful past sundown with nowhere to stay. If your day is similar go elsewhere – perhaps, for instance, the Cascadas del Rio Hermoso would have been a bit more protected from the wind by trees? The beach at Lago Faulkner is sandy but is right by route 40 (aka not as nice) and was still chilly despite facing east, so I just hopped in for a quick dip. Could easily skip to get to Cascadas Ñivinco sooner to spend more time there. It was still busy when I get there around 4, even though most of the foot traffic was heading out back to their cars, so hard to say if it would be pleasant during peak hours, but in my imagination it would be magnificent in full sun (since I still enjoyed it, even in the shade), and I would give it a shot for sure.*

**Day 14 –** ~~Valle Encantado on way from~~ **Villa Traful &gt; Bariloche** via 65/237, ✨**Cerro López (Bahía López route)** in the afternoon  
*First things first, I would add a full day in Villa Traful, obvio (and perhaps try to get to Villa Traful before sunset :D). Then you can maybe check out el bosque sumergido, the main town, and the alfajores at Del Montañés. I had initially planned on doing these things today, but got it into my harebrain I had to try to do the tough route up to Pico Turista before leaving Bariloche. Having already booked my bus out (dumbass) to El Bolsón for Day 15, and having no other feasible time in which I could attempt it given my overscheduling the rest of the trip, I tried to high-tail it back to Bariloche early in the morning on Day 14 to start up to Cerro López at a ""reasonable"" hour. I therefore also missed the hike (slash swimming?) at Valle Encantado. Actually, the best way to fix all this would be to add a full day for Cerro López earlier on, in which case you could perhaps do these things in and around Villa Traful ""today"" (aka the day you wake up in and leave Villa Traful), still possibly getting the car back to Bariloche at the end of the day, or driving back to Bariloche and doing Valle Encantado the next morning.*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days (1 for Cerro López earlier in the trip, and possibly a full day in Villa Traful)\~\~\~\~\~  
*As it was I made it to the trailhead at Bahía López around 12:30, which was too late really (for me, not for all people) to start, but I forced it. Because I was doing this more dangerous, unfrequented route alone (not advisable), I was going quite slow and cautiously. By the time I made it to the ridgeline/turnoff between Sendero Palotinos/Pico Turista and the below ridge ""route"" (used loosely), at the rate I was going (quite slow, like 1mph on the harder upward incline sections), I knew if I tried to go to Pico Turista via the ridge I wouldn't be able to get my car back to the rental place by 8pm, and maybe wouldn't even make it to a safer portion of the hike before sundown. So I cut across the N/E face of the mountain :(((. This isn't used that much either, apparently, so there were some dicey waterfall/snow crossings and lots of areas where the trail was not clear at all. I had my offline AllTrails map but that did not mean that the GPS route coincided with anything in reality. I still recommend this if you have experience bouldering/climbing/hiking for real for real, just go earlier so you can go at a safe pace and do the ridgeline to Pico Turista well before sunset (and, you know, go with an equally experienced friend). If you don't have experience with hardcore hikes, don't know how to step/aren't sure in your steps, DO NOT ATTEMPT. But I saw many condors, beautiful views, and had a fun time figuring out my way up the mountain.*

\~\~\~\~\~+1 day in Bariloche for a mani/pedi, souvenir shopping, laundry, etc.?\~\~\~\~\~

**BARILOCHE AREA SUMMARY**  
Did lots of amazing shit in 14 days, but I would recommend adding anywhere from 6-12, maybe even more days both to make it a bit more leisurely AND to get more sights/experiences in. Many of these added days would be during la Ruta de los 7 Lagos, which would mean a car for more days than I could afford (there were definitely people doing this by bus/hitchhiking, but I didn't research this so cannot advise), but if you budget better for that ahead of time and/or find friends/just have fam round to split that expense with you, it could work out.

See you next time in El Bolsón, El Chaltén, and El Calafate! (It took me a long time to write Part 1 so it might take a min for Part 2, but I'll get there!)",1728413674.0,2024-10-08 18:13:24
t3_1fy5fgd,Is British Airways broke? ,"I’ve just come back from travelling. I flew from London to Beijing with BA, then country hopped with Korean Air and Japan Airlines. This just highlighted the state of the BA planes and service. On KA and JA we were provided with meals and earphones and the entertainment systems seemed more updated and these were short haul flights. Whenever I’ve flown short haul with BA all we’ve ever gotten was a bottle of water and a chocolate biscuit bar. 

My only other comparison for long haul was Emirates (over 5 years ago) so I thought it was just the standard these days but clearly other flag carriers are able to offer better.

Edit: I don’t know why I’m being downvoted, I spent  over £990 on the BA flights alone excluding seat selection so I have a right to question the overall flight experience. ",1728300883.0,2024-10-08 18:13:24

Or should I stay one more day in Lanquin / Semuc Champey and remove one night in Flores? These are the thoughts I have that I would appreciate your feedback on. Ideally I would like to be flexiable and not book everything in advance, but this is high season and over the holidays, so I think stuff will sell out.

I made the mistake of registering for Iberia Plus using only my middle name. Now, whenever I try to book tickets, Iberia auto-fills my name, and I can't issue tickets with my LAST name (I've even had to cancel tickets because of this). To make matters worse, their website doesn't allow me to update my name myself.

I reached out to Iberia, and they directed me to fill out a form on [contacto.iberia.com](http://contacto.iberia.com), requesting the name correction and providing a copy of my passport. I've followed these steps, but each time I get an automated response telling me I can change my address or, if the issue persists, to submit the same form again—which I’ve already done three times.

I’m at a loss for what to do next. I even considered registering as a “frequent companion” using my full name to bypass this and issuing a ticket that way. I can't delete my current account and start fresh because I have a lot of Avios points that I’d lose. Has anyone experienced something similar? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

t3_1fyv0n8,Broken NFC tag on passport ,"Hello,

I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience. I am a Ukrainian citizen with a residence permit in the EU.

Recently, while traveling, I accidentally spilled water on my biometric passport. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be heavily affected; the appearance and 99% of the stamps look just like before.

However, I’m concerned about the biometric NFC chip embedded in the passport’s cover. I wasn’t even aware of its existence before. Now that I’ve read about it, I found an app called ReadID and tried to scan the chip — but it’s not being detected :(

For instance, my friend’s passport scans without any issues.

My question is: how critical is this problem? Could it affect border crossings, opening bank accounts, or any other procedures where the passport is required? Does this make the passport invalid? Or is there a chance that official institutions have different devices that might be able to read the chip, even if my phone can’t?

Thank you very much in advance for your reply.

(I cannot replace the passport at the moment since I would need to go to Ukraine for that, and right now that would mean being automatically drafted into the war. Although I haven’t lived there for over 10 years.)",1728376480.0,2024-10-08 18:13:24

I’m wondering whether that would be overkill, considering that most Caribbean islands are mainly about the beaches, and every beach looks the same. Other than lying on the beach, going deep-sea fishing, snorkeling, or scuba diving, you quickly run out of things to do. On the other hand, the Virgin Islands does have a national park which could offer a variety of things to do. Plus, there’s that third Island Saint Croix although that could probably be done in two or three days. Seeking advice from those of you that either live there or have visited the Virgin Islands asked you how much time would be adequate to see the place and whether two weeks there would be overkill.

It’s October, so obviously YMMV. I’m a keen traveller, mainly in Europe and have visited over 300 small towns and cities. Taormina was right up there for me. The sweets were delicious, we chose a restaurant a bit out of the way of the beaten path, and hiked around the town a bit. We are two young women travelling, based in Catania for the week. 

Yes: Catania is grittier and more “authentic” and I would say the food scene is better. And the night time is lit up and beautiful and eclectic. It’s fun, it’s the perfect base. But Taormina has charm, gorgeous views, lovely beaches. It’s not a hellhole. If I were to compare, for example, with Oia in Santorini which truly was a whitewashed hellhole of exactly the same manufactured crap over and over, made in PRC, you’d obviously see Taormina is the better choice.

t3_1fyfmr8,Trying to round out my Taiwan itinerary,"Hi all,

I've got a trip coming up to Taiwan at the end of this month for about 8 days. We'll be starting out in Taipei and planning to do a lot of the common activities and day trips from there (Yangmingshan, Beitou, biking around the city, night markets, Elephant and/or Teapot mountain hikes). 

We want to see another part of the country as well and have landed on Tainan. Currently we're booked for 3 nights there (arrive afternoon day 1, two full days, leave early back to Taipei on day 3). 

I've read that Tainan is all about history and food, and personally I'm not too much into the history when I travel. I'm not disinterested, but I'm not the type of person to prioritize museums or temples just for the educational aspect. I'm more intersted in nature/scenery, food, walking/biking around, local culture. It's very hard to tell if two full days in Tainan is going to be overkill for this and if we should prioritize Taipei time. 

Also we were considering the east coast but spending 5 hours to and from Taitung seemed like a lot of time after the rest of our travel (we'll be in Singapore coming from US first, so a lot of time on planes and traveling). Though biking around that area seems really nice. 

Just trying to find a good way to round out our trip and a bit worried Tainan might be a miss. It seems very polarizing in that many people recommend but then many people say it's boring. For someone like me that wouldn't normally prioritize museums/historical education, is there still enough to fill 2 days that wouldn't be better spent elsewhere?

t3_1fy2dpd,The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

BOA airlines sucks and is very corrupt (not surprising to anyone who knows Bolivia well). With Bolivia's recent currency volatility, things have gotten a lot worse. Not a lot of options around Bolivia, unfortunately. 

  
**IF FLYING BOA:** 

1. Do not let the airline put priority tags on your luggage (if you are paying for an upgraded seat). All this will do is make your bag a target to be stolen / ransacked when checked 

2. Keep everything valuable with you... Particularly cash (should be obvious but i'll state the obvious)

3. If you are checking a bag, don't lock your luggage. Airline workers will just cut the locks off and ruin your suitcase. Might as well let them search through your things without breaking your suitcase so you don't have to spend a few hundred replacing the luggage they ripped into. BOA will not take any accountability for their employees breaking into your luggage and stealing your belongings.

t3_1fyjkbz,Where to end our trip to Colombia,"Planning to travel through Colombia for the last two weeks of January and looking for somewhere to end the trip. So far we’re going to Pasto (where my friend’s family is from), then to the Tatacoa Desert, then to Cartagena. We are considering then doing Leticia for the Amazon, but the popular tour is a bit pricey so we haven’t locked it down yet and are looking for potential alternatives. Any suggestions? This leg of the trip would last about 4 days, and we’re traveling by plane in between each destination. We prefer nature spots over cities. Any must-sees? Hidden gems? Authentic experiences? Breathtaking views or fun adventures?

(Please do not suggest Medellin/Guatape as I have done that trip quite recently.)

We live in Scandinavia so the days in winter are long, dark and cold, especially January. We´re both prone to winter depression, so now that we have the opportunity for a vacation in January, we´re planning on taking it. Indonesia has been an option we have been considering, and we wouldmlove to go there, but it seems as though the rain season is at it´s peak in January in parts of Indonesia. Though the rain itself doesn´t bother us that much, the high humidity does.

For context we would love to stay somewhere that´s not super mainstream or full of resorts. If we find a nice area, we´ll look into the opportunity of renting a nice little place for a couple weeks, somewhere by the coast, somewhere quiet. Preferably not around the biggest cities, but located near a village or something along those lines. We love good food but our budget doesn´t allow us fine dining, but that´s not a problem, somewhere with good local food is more than enough! We would love to stay somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture! We also love to surf and swim (we´re both beginners at surfing though) , but having that oppurtunity is also a big part of the vacation.

To summarize; we would love advice / suggestions on somewhere to go on vacation in south-east Asia that´s not to touristic and not too overflooded with rain and high humidity in January. Preferably somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture, where it´s possible to surf. Any suggestions or general advice is very appreciated! Thank you!!

There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").

t3_1fyfn9k,South America 6 weeks travel itinerary,"Hello Reddit travelers!

We are a couple from Sweden, 30 and 27 years old, planning a 6-week trip through South America starting in January 2024. We’ve already booked our arrival and departure flights, landing in Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd of January and flying home from San José, Costa Rica, on the 18th of February. We love  to explore both cities and nature, but prefer to keep things fairly comfortable, avoiding long hikes and multi-day camping trips. We’ll mostly be flying between countries to save time and exploring various destinations without overloading our schedule. We're looking to stay in private rooms at hostels to stay on budget, but might consider hotels for a few nights in total if they're worth the extra buck. 

We have a route in mind and would love any feedback, especially tips on the must-sees, hidden gems, and general advice on logistics!
 

**--- January 3–13 (10 days) – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

We’re thinking about staying in the Ipanema area, close to Copacabana.
Planning to explore iconic spots like Sugarloaf Mountain, Selarón Steps, Parque Lage, and the beaches of course.
We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe).
Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out.
For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.   


 We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in?
We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?  


 **--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.**

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants.
Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.


**--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco)  – Fly to Cusco, Peru.**

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?  

  
**--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).**

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing?
Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.


**--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.**

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.


**--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.**

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example.
We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? 
We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?


**--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.**

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic.
Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

Trees, ponds, forests and the great outdoors.

t3_1fy9zwm,"Connecting through Miami International on Friday, should I change it?","I'm flying from South America to Chicago via Miami on Friday the 11th, and this hurricane that's brewing has me worried. 

It's not supposed to hit Miami as of right now but that could change. Also Friday is like 2 days after the estimated landfall that's going to be on Wednesday and it should've dissipated by then but I don't know how much.

What worries me is that if the area surrounding the airport floods then they're probably going to close that airport. 

It's very important that I get to Chicago on Friday so I can't move the trip to next week. 

It's going to be me and my wife but we're in separate reservations. Hers is paid with cash and has a strict cancellation policy and mine was with miles and has a flexible cancelation policy. 

I have the option of flying through Houston instead, which will give me a little peace of mind but we would be forfeiting her ticket and losing that money. The thing is that I should make the decision today, bc the price is still kinda reasonable. 

So my options would be, waiting it out and leaving everything as is, but risk my trip getting upended by the hurricane, or losing my wife's ticket money and just changing my ticket and buying a new one for her (but risking that Miami would be unscathed and I spent all that money for nothing)

We had an EasyJet flight from Madeira to Porto which got cancelled yesterday night and rescheduled to today. We had a train from Porto to Lisbon and hotel bookings which we had to cancel. 

We had to leave from Lisbon to Madrid on 9th Oct and since we only get a day in Lisbon due to cancellation we decided to not go to Lisbon altogether and booked a flight from Porto to Madrid.

All the flights are EasyJet and they are not allowing us to cancel the Lisbon to Madrid flights.

Is there anything that can we be done to get the refund of that one flight? ",1728291226.0,2024-10-08 18:13:40

After five intense years of working Mondays to Sundays building my (successful!) business and taking 0 vacation, I’m craving some well-deserved rest on a beautiful beach, soaking in the sun and gazing at the turquoise ocean.

I’m considering a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands and looking to book either an Airbnb or, more likely, a hotel there. While I will mostly rest, I want to explore the island, visit snorkeling spots, restaurants, bars, and different beaches. My concern is: I don't drive. I don't have a license. I read everywhere than renting a car is essential to move around.

So I'm wondering: Can I simply rely on the cabs? I understand it can be an expensive option, but I’m willing to spend some money. Do cabs go everywhere? Is there a hotel that’s closer to the main attractions?

Thank you so much for your help.

t3_1fy7h65,Travel suggestions for Nov and Dec on east coast,"Hi everyone,

My family is visiting from overseas in mid-November and will stay until Jan beginning. They live in a tropical country, so they've never experienced fall colors or snowy winters before. I live on the East Coast, and I'd love for them to experience as many things as possible. I'm planning weekend trips mostly so they can rest during the week (I have work, and my parents are in their 60s, so I don't want to overwhelm them).

Here's what I have in mind:

1. **Fall foliage:** Do any states still have fall foliage left by the 3rd week of November? I was thinking of taking them to DC, but I’m open to suggestions.
2. **Niagara Falls:** Is it worth visiting during late November/Thanksgiving weekend? How is the experience around that time?
3. **New York City:** Planning an overnight stay around Christmas/New Year and going to see the Statue of Liberty the next day. Which one would be better
4. 3-4 days trip to California to get them some sun and just relax on the beach.

If anyone has other recommendations, I’d love to hear them. I'm looking for ideas that would be easy on them  but still let them enjoy the best of what this season has to offer.

t3_1fya1r4,Hertz is trying to charge me for damage to the car pls give me advice ,"We returned the car with no damages and the agent that checked our car verbally stated that there were no damages. The gas lid that is on the outside of the car with the paint fell off on the first refueling of the car when I tried to open it by pushing and it just came off with my hand. It was completely undamaged at return and the agent said it was no problem and he tried to reattach it himself but there was a crunch sound and he snapped something. He then said that he would have to send it to the shop so they can re attach it and reassured me that there would be no charges whatsoever. Once again if you note the areas of damage in the report there is nothing that says damage just assessment to the gas lid which in the picture is right next to it. If the gas lid was damaged it was done by the agent. 

I never received an email about the damages and deleted any pictures and videos I had about the car to save storage on my phone. I only received a letter which I didn’t see until I returned from travels. It is wrong that I was not sent an email as soon as this was billed and only got a physical mail that I didn’t see for another month. 

there has to be security camera footage of my return date at the time that I signed the document showing that I explained it to the agent and that he himself tried to reattach it and damaged it right? He was reassuring me that no fees would be charged and no damage was done and that they just needed to reattach it.

I can either cut my holiday short by a day that would mean I can travel back before the '6 month expiry period' or if the rule doesn't apply on leaving dubai then I might be okay. I won't know until I get to the airport and will have to take that chance.

t3_1fy4rhm,Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

t3_1fyh24n,Flight Fares Driving Me Nuts – Is There Any Real Price Protection?,"Hey folks, I’ve been trying to book a flight from SFO to PVR and, man, these fares are all over the place. One day they’re sky-high, the next they’ve plummeted. United seems to be at the helm of this madness.

I’ve even seen next-day flights drop in price significantly, which is super frustrating because I’m torn—do I grab something “reasonable” now, only to watch it fall by $200 a week later? Should I wait? Am I just doomed to stress-refreshing flight deals?

I vaguely remember some airlines offering price protection, but I can’t recall which ones (or if that’s even still a thing). Maybe third-party sites like Orbitz offer this? Though, my last experience trying to make a claim with one of those price guarantees felt like battling customer service bosses in an endless loop of “please hold.”

So, what’s the best strategy for dealing with these wildly fluctuating fares? And is there any legit price protection out there? Would love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT:**  I just booked a fare and didn't realize that United now has this ""fare lock"" feature where you can lock the fare for - in this case - 3 days - and then opt to buy or not.  Wish I had known about this feature earlier as the prices have been fluctuating wildly by the day.  Well, thanks again, all.",1728331248.0,2024-10-08 18:13:40

t3_1fyj80o,Can KLM really trick me into giving them EUR 980,"
All my life I’ve been dreaming of going to Rio de Janeiro. I booked a flight to celebrate finishing my master’s degree. I had to work while studying to afford this trip. I booked a basic fare (EUR 980) by accident and asked customer service if I could upgrade to a student fare (for an extra EUR 110). They told me it was okay. The student fare brings several benefits such as checked-in luggage but most importantly, flexibility. You can reschedule for free and get a refund for EUR 250. So I upgraded. When upgrading I specifically asked if I could get all the benefits from the student ticket. Yes, they said, I specifically asked if I could reschedule for free and if I can reschedule for free and get a refund for the TOTAL price minus the EUR 250 cancellation fee. The lady said yes.

To keep a long story short, my last exam didn’t go as planned and I don’t really know when exactly I can go (this is out of my control). So instead of rebooking the flight for free I decided it’s worth losing the cancellation fee of EUR 250 from my total EUR 1090 and rebook by myself afterwards somewhere in mid-February to mid-March since I didn’t know exactly when I would be able to go.

The issue: I got back EUR 110 and nothing else. I explained to customer support that I was informed the opposite and they simply don’t care. Since I did the upgrade and asked about the cancellation through phone, I expect their guidance and given word to be correct. What can I do?

* Should we include Malaga too?

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip.

t3_1fxvmgq,Argentina: Buenos Aires or Salta for 3-4 extra days,"Hello...I am taking a group tour in Argentina and Chile. This is not my normal (solo) mode of travel, but sounds like a decent value and will be relaxing for me to let someone else be I charge.   
I have have more time available (26 days), than the length of the tour (18 days). So, I have arranged to arrive 4 days earlier and leave 4 days later than the rest of the tour group. In the first 4 days. I am flying to see iguazu falls. Should be cool and fine. So far so good.  
For the last 4 days... December 26-29.. I am contemplating flying to Salta to explore. This would give me  2-1/2 to 3 days there.. leaving out flying time. 

The tour itself will go to the parana' delta area , rocoleta cemetery area, explore one or two neighborhoods in Buenosaires and gives us about half a day that is unstructured and on our own. This doesnt seem like much time to see the city. before we the fly off to Patagonia.   

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool. In the later option I would probably lose a day due to flying.. (the flight is only 2 hours, but to get to airport and out of airport twice etc.. will shoot most of a day.

I also considered taking a ferry to Uruguay and renting a car, but I read that Uruguay is quite sedate.... So.. Uruguay? Buenos Aires more in-depth or Salta?  

BTW, this will be my first time ever in South America. and I do not speak Spanish.  
but, I am a relatively experienced traveller.

Without getting too far into it, my daughter is fed through a feeding tube connected to her stomach. She has to be connected to her pump for 20 hours a day. I understand her pump and medications can be carried on or even checked for free due to them being medical devices. 


One other challenge is she requires special formula we can’t buy at grocery stores and will need to bring a complete supply with us. Can this be considered medical or will we have to check a bag full of formula? 

I have a CPAP machine as well, could we have one large “medical bag”?

t3_1fy0s0c,Need advice on my Vietnam itinerary,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are planning a trip to Vietnam from January 30th to February 10th next year. We’ve already booked our tickets, which were a great deal, but I overlooked the fact that our trip coincides with the Tet celebrations. We’re feeling a bit anxious about how the first few days might go, so we’d love some feedback from anyone with more experience in Vietnam during this time.

Here’s our itinerary:

* **January 30:** Arrive at Hanoi airport, then take a private transfer to Tam Coc, Ninh Binh. We should arrive by 4 PM, so we’ll keep it low-key—grab a meal, walk around, and acclimatize after the flight.
* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

We’re wondering if we’ll be able to arrange private transfers during Tet and whether the weather will be warm enough to enjoy the beaches in Da Nang and Hoi An at that time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1728280543.0,2024-10-08 18:13:40

t3_1fy6p82,Krakow Travel Report,"**Arrival:**

My visit to Kraków took place on an overcast few days in early October 2024. I'd set aside three days for the city and a day trip to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. The appeal was the affordability of the trip and a curiosity to visit a Polish city and learn more about Polish culture, the WW2 history at Auschwitz-Birkenau (the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers) was also a factor in the decision to go. Many Poles choose to come to work and live in my country of residence; and I reciprocally desired to gain an understanding of their cultural background.

Alighting at the train station and walking past Barbakan (est. 1498) and through St. Florian's Gate (c. 1307) was an impressive entrance to the city. It was about 10pm at this point and as we walked down Floriańska (St. Florian's Street), I quickly noticed a number of dolled up young women standing in the middle of the street holding black umbrellas in the light rainy drizzle, looking around at bypassers. Was this prostitution or something else? Not the best first impression, but I am aware that soliciting for prostitution is legal in Poland and their laws on the matter are more lax. Sadly, in my opinion this does colour public spaces with a sleazy vibe, I think such activities should be kept out of sight especially in such a thoroughfare not far from the main square. Even at night. I did not notice any police presence monitoring these apparent activities.

**Day 1:**

Fast forward to the next day and we started by walking through part of the charming ‘Planty park’ (a circular park which encompasses the entire Old Town district), noticing an amusing overabundance of park benches. Unfortunately there were no big central parks or highly curated green areas besides this. We then hauled ourselves up a gradual slope to ascend Wawel Hill to the castle and cathedral. This is considered the most culturally important site in Poland. After having a quick stroll around the imposing Italian-style castle courtyard, we chose to enter the (nearly 1,000 year-old) cathedral via the audio-guided tour, which was not too costly. Sadly the cathedral tower was heavily scaffolded which tarnished the view. The audioguide headsets conveniently triggered different audio clips as you walk around the site, which meant you didn't have to key in numbers. Wawel Cathedral is where Polish monarchs were formerly crowned and buried. The monarchy was abolished on 25th November 1795. It's a shame that the Polish monarchy has ended as I find national interest in its own intelligentsia and ruling class to be a showcase of heroism, statecraft, and political leadership through the centuries. Although I acknowledge the valid criticism of the notion of monarchy.

From the outside, the cluster of different architectural additions over the centuries is intriguing to see, particularly the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel (1533) which was beautiful and is considered the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps, dedicated to the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty. It's worth noting that the site was getting quite busy and numerous tour groups were congregating and piling through the cathedral. Because it was a relatively small cathedral, this crowding did feel slightly uncomfortable (but still manageable) at times. There were no photos permitted inside the cathedral. 

We ascended the steep steps of the Royal Sigismund Bell tower which led to the bell at the top and a slightly restricted view over the city through a wire barrier. There was a photo op to touch the bell's clapper, which is considered good luck. Once again it was quite busy in this space owing to the crowds, luckily there was a separate descent staircase available.

We then walked down Wawel Hill into the expansive 13th century town square (Rynek Główny), the so-called ‘biggest medieval square in Europe’ according to some sources, but Charles Square in Prague is actually two times larger FYI. Our first port of call was the free to enter Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) shopping arcade in the middle of the town square, many vendor outlets sold what looked like traditional Polish goods, in particular the amber goods typical of the region and many other figurines, souvenirs, and models. 

After this we entered the grand Brick Gothic St. Mary's Basilica which sadly had a cladding of scaffolding on the main tower due to longterm repairs, meaning ascending the tower was not possible. The interior was beautiful but it was a fairly brief experience after sitting down to soak up all the churchiness. Every hour a bugle player plays a traditional five-note bugle call (hejnał) from the basilica's tallest tower. They often wave down at the crowds below. We popped into the Muzeum Farmacji (Pharmacy Museum), it is a small museum which features a good collection of pharmacy paraphernalia, but I wasn't raving about it after a few rooms full of similar jars and pots. The information and presentation of the museum appeared to have been unchanged for many years.

Walking around Wawel Hill and the town itself, images of the Polish Pope, John Paul II (1920-2005) - born Karol Józef Wojtyła - can be seen in many places, some may even say excessively! I found it quite whimsical seeing so many portraits of JP2, even despite my reservations about the Catholic Church as an institution. You can sometimes see monks walking around the town on their daily commutes.

**Day 2:**

On our second day we hopped on a guided tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. The tour was well organised although the bus itself was fairly cramped. First we stopped at Auschwitz I (Stammlager), known as former administrative and operational centre of the death-camp, and we're given headsets to hear a crystal clear transmission of the guide's voice as we were taken around the site as part of the group tour. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was the more visually striking of the two sites, with the instantly recognisable gatehouse and train tracks. The Birkenau site was even bigger than I'd imagined. The barbed wire fences and guard towers tapered off into the distance, with the site covering 6,000 football pitches of space. Both sites put together were a moving warning about humanity's darkest capabilities, with well-selected and impactful exhibits. Although I could see no central dedicated museum building. We returned to Kraków, getting back at around 7pm before then going to ‘The Black Duck’ restaurant which was very good value and enjoyable (plus points for duck theming), it was hands down the culinary highlight of the trip. Walking back to our accommodation we were solicited by a prostitute, but politely turned down the offer.

**Summary:**

I found Poland quite dour. A number of the eateries we went to nearly all played melancholic music, many of the souvenir shops stock items with an intriguing tearful girl theme, combining this melancholia with a sudden rundown post-communist greyness (and countless graffitied walls) almost immediately outside of Kraków's Old Town district, the hyped up Kazimierz area is no exception to this. Alongside the city's proximity to a major former Nazi death-camp, the experience was somewhat overshadowed by these things. Of course, Poland cannot easily separate itself from this history under Soviet &amp; Nazi occupation and before that being partitioned three times (the Austrian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition) in the late 18th century leading to 123 years of no Polish sovereignty. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed. The identity and nation of the Poles has been under threat for centuries and I think this reflects in the locals' outlook and culture, they are a guarded people fiercely interested in their national identity and faith. This is a nation in the process of regaining its pride and sense of self. The creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, was only founded in 1989, making modern Poland only 35 years old. In 2022, Poland, Greece, and Cyprus had the highest percentage of adults in the EU at risk of depression, with a share of 65 percent. This is a country with many depressed and downhearted people, but Poland is certainly moving through a period of new beginnings.

Another thing to mention is the Cracovian road zebra crossings don't often have traffic lights. So there were a number of times I felt unsafe trusting motorists to spot me and stop to allow me to safely cross the road. With that being said there isn't a lot of traffic around Kraków and locals are encouraged to use the trams.

Tourist attractions around Kraków were okay, it's very church-heavy reflecting the Catholic way of life there. At times I felt the historical museums could have told Poland's national story more narratively and engagingly. I understand there was a golden age for Poland before the partitions and then occupations during the 20th century. This golden age roughly corresponds to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572).

However, I found the Cracovian museums to be more descriptive than narrative in tone, drily listing information rather than arranging it for a modern touristic palette. Because Poland's history is more on the niche side, I'd have hoped for a more comprehensive overview/retelling. The Rynek Underground Museum (under the town square) seemed like a tourist trap displaying a banal arrangement of rocks and pillars. I decided to avoid entry. The same can be said of the former town hall tower, the view is said to be extremely limited.

To justify a trip to Kraków I recommend spending about two days there max. You will enjoy great value for money on food and drink but the tourist sites are nothing out of this world. You should ideally combine the town with a day trip to either the salt mine or Auschwitz-Birkenau, or perhaps to the mountains nearby if you are outdoorsy (the Tatra Mountains and Zakopane, a popular resort town in the foothills of the mountains). I recommend taking in the town slowly, it shouldn't be rushed as you may quickly run out of things to do if you are not careful.

I give Kraków an overall 5.5/10.

**Souvenirs:**

I struggled to find many souvenirs/keepsakes that really caught my eye. I would recommend having a look in the Kraków Cloth Hall and the outlets on the outside of the building, although I felt much of the items for sale were almost identical between the stalls, the variety on offer was unfortunately lacking. 
I recommend checking out Niebieska Kropka Boleslawiec Pottery and the ""Kacper Ryx"" Historical Shop. I purchased a handmade fridge magnet from the latter which was fairly pricey, but had rustic appeal. I also stumbled across the Wawel Castle Souvenir shop (to the left of the courtyard entrance as you enter) and it turned out to be one of the better souvenir shops in Kraków. So do check that out.

**Food:**

None of my travel review should be considered exhaustive, but I highly recommend going to Czarna Kaczka/ Black Duck for authentic Polish cuisine. Try the Borscht (beetroot soup), it's very tasty. Also make sure you have pierogi somewhere during your visit. For breakfast I heartily recommend Milkbar Tomasza and the savoury pancake with spinach and cheese filling.",1728305046.0,2024-10-08 18:13:40

I'm hoping to travel as much as my money will allow. We live in Montreal. My son is off one week in November and one week in April (Easter) so I'm looking for a destination with him. He will be 15 and obsessed with Disney. We have already been to the Florida and California ones. He wants to be an imagineer when he's older. Some ideas: Paris with Disneyland, a Disney cruise from Florida, Greece (he's also into mythology and Percy Jackson). He's not a picky eater which is good for traveling and loves museums. 

My daughter will have the first three weeks of January off. She will be 18 and is very easy going. Not really into museums. She wants to learn how to surf and is super into Asian culture (but Japan is a no no which will be explained later). I was thinking Vietnam, Costa Rica, a cruise, New Zealand, a cruise, etc. We can also do a group thing (Intrepid or G adventures). She will not travel somewhere where she needs an extra vaccine! lol!

At some point during my break I'm planning on going to Japan with my husband. Just the two of us. We aren't sure when, probably October or early March (before blossoms). I think we should add South Korea since it's close.

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I am not bound to specific vacation times like when I'm teaching. Usually I can only travel during the summer (which is too bad since we have great weather here and have a pool we like to enjoy), Christmas or March break.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

From what I can tell, we'll be paying 4x the amount, which sucks, but it's the only thing that can work.  So, if there's a way to balance keeping costs down wherever we can vs. might as well enjoy it since we're gonna pay too much, I'm all ears.  
The places that seem geographically viable are the Canary Islands, Various spots in the Carribean, or the south of Spain, but we're open to any suggestions within these places or beyond them.  Would appreciate any advice.

t3_1fxnfc4,How to setup a trip through the Pacific Northwest in August with a toddler,"We are a couple with a 3 year old kid and I’m in charge of suggesting an itinerary for a trip next August. 

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

We're aiming for mid-late May 2025. Thank you in advance!

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast.

After analyzing flight prices and doing my own research, Medellin looks like the one of the cheapest options(from Toronto). And seems to be right up my alley in terms of what I am looking for, which is a big city, that also has some natural attractions to explore nearby.

Secondly, I have a couple language exchange partners that I have been speaking to from there, so I will (potentially) have some locals to help me.   


My question is, does 5 days (4 nights) seem like enough time for Medellin? Is there a better place you would visit if you were in my shoes?

t3_1fxgsrz,Should I tweak my New Zealand Itinerary to add 1 night in Hawke's Bay?,"I am planning a return trip to New Zealand's North Island after doing a 2 week trip to the South Island last year. I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

	•	We enjoy outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and trying local food.

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

What doesn't make sense to me is the trip from Atitlan to Flores as it's a 10-12 hours journey. But then it makes sense to get from Flores to Belize.

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

t3_1fxgmu1,Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

t3_1fxbat3,Cairns/Port Douglas vs. Auckland for last big trip from Australia,"My partner and I have lived in Australia a few years and are currently in Hobart. We plan to move back to North America in the next year and are deciding between two options for our final big (expensive) trip - The Great Barrier Reef or New Zealand. 

Due to timing and cost, we can only spend a week, so we’d be limited to just one of the islands in NZ. Timing is in the next two months, which I know isn’t great as we get into rainy season for QLD, but that’s what works for our schedules. I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. ",1728200554.0,2024-10-08 18:13:57

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her.

I had a trip of a lifetime there a few years ago unexpectedly. Despite Sayulita’s struggles around sewage, trash, and being a bustling party scene, I found a lot of magic and wonder there. I feel like every time I travel now I am seeking out some of the magic I found in Sayulita but never know exactly how to put it into words. It isn’t the perfect destination by any means but I found myself and so much wonder there and it was wonderful to me. Its small size, community, gorgeous scenery, lack of a need to plan anything did wonders on me. I also loved all of the little musicians around town as a struggling musician myself. 

I’ve traveled all around the world looking for something similar to what Sayulita was before it blew up and haven’t been able to find it.  Is that what we all do when we travel? Forever searching for our perfect spots? Anyone here ever found any beach towns similar to old Sayulita? 

I live in Texas. Sayulita was a short two hour plane ride followed by a bus ride for me. Felt like it was in the middle of nowhere yet still only an hour from major cities and good hospitals. ",1728145854.0,2024-10-08 18:13:57
t3_1fx1slz,Philippines travel itinerary ,"Hey all, myself and my partner are wanting to go to the Philippines next year in November. We are flying from the UK and are initially going to stop over in Singapore for a few nights before flying to either Cebu or Manila. We will have about 11 nights total in the Philippines. 

Thinking if we fly into Manila, we take an internal flight straight away to El Nido. Stay there for 4 nights and take a boat tour to see Coron island. Any recommendations for which tour to do? I’ve seen there are 4 different ones to choose from.

Then flying to Bohol and spending 3 nights there.

After that taking the boat across to Cebu and spend the remaining 4 nights there.

Happy to have any suggestions or changes to the plan. This is just a rough idea as we are finding it quite hard the best way to travel away in the most efficient whilst seeing a few of the islands.

Thanks in advance!

t3_1fxf5z8,Asked to pay for stained sheets by the hotel,"Hello, I spent 2 nights in a hotel in Thailand, and had a nose bleed during the night, which left 2 stains of blood on the sheets. The hotel is asking me to pay the equivalent of 70$ for housecleaning, which is way more than I paid for the room for 2 nights…. 

I obviously don’t want to pay, because blood stains can be washed and the sheets already had some stains (small but still) and I think the price is insane. It’s also not specified anywhere in the room the cost of any of the items if they were to replace them.

My strategy is to go tell them I’m not gonna pay for stains that can be washed and definitely not that much. The main issue is I have my passeport as deposit (I know stupid) so probably I’ll have to pay hopefully I can negotiate.

t3_1fxl3yr,Cairo really doesn't deserve the bad reputation.... ,"As the title says

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

t3_1fx8f8a,"Last months of our trip, Nepal or more SEA ?","Hey travelers,

my girlfriend and I are in the last month of our one year world trip and have a hard decision to make.

So far we travelled Argentina/Bolivia/Peru/Chile/Columbia/Mexiko/Japan/South Korea and now are in Laos. Our original plan was to go to north Vietnam (Ha Giang Loop) after Laos and then fly to India for a month and afterwards to the Philippines in December cause we gonna met some friends there.

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

So its basically 

Vietnam/India/Philippines/New Zealand 

vs 

Nepal/India/Philippines/Vietnam or New Zealand

I know this is really about personal preferences but still we would be happy for some input from other travelers. Both North Vietnam and Nepal were affected by the current floods so we are quite unsure about that also. Is is even possible to do the three passes trek that spontaneous ? Also we are travelling with hand luggage and would have to buy/rent a lot of stuff in Nepal.

Thanks !

t3_1fxblxi,How is this Switzerland itinerary for Jan?,"Me and my family will be in Lyon over January and we want to spend a week in Switzerland. It'll be me + partner and 2 kids (6 and 10).

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)",1728201948.0,2024-10-08 18:13:57
t3_1fwkv4m, Magic in Macedonia,"Macedonia took us by surprise. It’s not the first place people think of when they plan a Balkan trip, but man, it should be. We drove through Skopje, with its mix of old-world charm and modern quirks, and ended up camping by Lake Ohrid. The stillness of the lake, surrounded by mountains, had this calming effect—like you were in a different world.

One night, we met a group of Macedonian travelers who invited us to a small village festival. There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them. We nursed the van back to the nearest town, with every downhill stretch feeling like a gamble. A quick fix at another local garage got us going again, but it was a reminder that this adventure came with real risks.",1728112764.0,2024-10-08 18:13:57

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport? Also does anyone know Denver airport well? Would we have to switch terminals in order to get to the domestic departures gate from the international arrivals gate?

t3_1fwv6uk,Delta Premium Select vs Comfort + ,"Last year I flew Premium Select to Seoul. This year I went with Comfort + and am glad I did. On both Premium Select and Comfort +, I had an aisle seat on the left. I'm petite (5'), so I did not notice a difference in leg/seat room for either. Taller ppl will probably feel a difference, so I've read. Premium select served meals using actual plates and utensils, but honestly, it didn't matter that I was using wooden cutlery with Comfort +. I think I read the tv screens are bigger in Premium too, but I did not notice a difference. In short, I'm glad I went w/ Comfort + and will choose it over Premium Select for future long-haul flights.

Been debating doing a 3D2N boat tour but a few things:

-safety being potentially the only woman on said boat?

- sleeping arrangements on islands? Heard horrors about sleeping on floor with rodents running over you, no bedding or real facilities?

It looks like a super cool op though and would prefer to do that than taking a plane. Just don’t want to waste £250/£300 and be scared and upset lol

t3_1fwuyzx,3.5 weeks in Spain - any tips?,"Want to go to Spain next year in late September. Once I get it in my head to go somewhere, I need to plan it out on paper so I can stop obsessing over the dates 😆

Thinking we could do something like this...

Option 1:
- Arrive in Barcelona on 19 September - 6 nights 
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 1 night (breaking up the N to S journey)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 3 nights
- Fly home (13 October)

OR

Option 2:
- Arrive in Madrid on 11 September - 1 night to settle in
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 3 nights 
- Barcelona - 6 nights (quicker trip same day rather than having to arrive the night before directly from San Sebastian and lose a night there)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 1 night
- Fly home (6 October)

All domestic travel by train. 

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1. I thought it might feel a bit more relaxing though to have the 3 nights at the end. 

Keen for some feedback on these itineraries and if I'm giving too much or too little time in certain cities. 

The search function here will get a lot of use from me, but any tips or recommendations would be wholeheartedly welcomed! Our first time in Spain. Into the usual stuff: food, vibes, sights, walking aimlessly, local experiences, etc.  ",1728147570.0,2024-10-08 18:14:13

t3_1fw3r80,Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else.

t3_1fx4okn,Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues. Orbitz doesn't even need to admit any error. But they do need to fix it.

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right?

Just thought I'd throw it out there now and see if anyone has experienced this before:

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both?

Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot.

t3_1fvoezl,"The Underrated Gems of Cáceres &amp; Merída, Spain","Extremadura is a region in SW Spain that even Spaniards don't visit that much. I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. ",1728094584.0,2024-10-08 18:14:13

March 2025 is when I'll be done with my grad school program, and as a reward I want to go on a solo travel for up to two weeks. I have several destinations that I have in mind and things I want to do there, and wanted to get estimates on how long it would take me for the stuff I want to do plus anything else you guys might suggest. I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum
* The Scottish highlands, Wales, the Lake District, Cornwall, the Cotswolds

**4. Japan (1.5 weeks?)**

Similiar to UK, I wanted to stay in Toyko initially, But I feel there's so much to explore in Japan. Really want to fit in time to visit an onsen at least for two days, and do stuff between Toyko and Osaka? Full list of things I want to do:

* Eat tons of sushi, ramen, curry, tempura bowls, and even a fugu sashimi
* Visit to Studio Ghibli Museum
* Visit to Tokyo tower
* Shibuya
* Onsen Trip, as I mentioned
* Shopping for some tax-free items cheaper compare to US; Maybe a Gundam Figure build kit or a Gibson Guitar?",1728102282.0,2024-10-08 18:14:13

In Bali, I find Gili T, Nusa Penida, Ubud and Uluwatu nice but considering I’m only going for a week I would probably leave Gili T and Nusa Penida out. I am considering Bali but it honestly is my last option as how touristy it is kind of turns me off.

In Vietnam, I would really like to visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Hoi an. I am not sure if this is too many places for one week. Phu quoc is also on the list but I’ve heard it is a tourist trap (?)

Thailand. I haven’t really looked at a particular place in Thailand yet but I am considering visiting Thailand as it would be the “best” time to visit.

Has anyone traveled from Canada to any of these places (with PR card in hand + their *weak* national passport)? Are some more relaxed than others?

Called the number above and they worked to see what they could do. They offered me credits for the other half and told me that it would be a $99 service fee for this since it was a manual refund. 

I believe I started to be scammed here.

I gave them my credit card info (I don’t think I should have done this looking back), and they sent me an email from: reservations@thebookingconfirmation.com. It was a receipt and information but it looks shady. The charge on my credit card also shows as: airtktservices(followed by a number). 

What really made me think I just got scammed is they said I would have to call a specific number in order to use the credits: +1-844-202-1445.

When I look for the credits on my account, I do not see them, nor do I have anything from Expedia confirming this in the app.

I don’t really know what to do and I am just frustrated with the situation. Did I get scammed?",1728070615.0,2024-10-08 18:14:13

I am looking to invite my family from Mexico to come and visit us for couple of weeks. Ideally would be landing in London however direct flights are exprensive. Cheapest is landing in Manchaster, but with stopover in London...

  
Now the question is, if they would have stopover in London can they just ignore LON -&gt; MAN flight, leave the airport and go back with me? If they do that, are there any consequences?

Will it affect in anyway their journey back with the same air line?

In Australia since we’ll be with my friend, we’re primarily planning on experiencing the city, enjoying dining/ wine, and exploring the university where he’s getting his PhD.

In New Zealand, we’d likely be planning on doing a tour of Hobiton since we’re both Lord of the Rings geeks, and hopefully enjoying some nature or hiking. If anyone has specific suggestions to tailor our plans, I’d love to hear your thoughts! ",1728055293.0,2024-10-08 18:14:13

t3_1fw6nft,"I Need Advice With My Travel Itinerary (Beer Trip, Focusing on Belgium) — It's My 1st Time In Europe","Next year, I'll be taking a 22-day solo trip around Europe to celebrate my 40th birthday, starting with **Belgian Beer Weekend and ending with Oktoberfest**. My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi. But if I stay in Vleteren, I'll be able to walk there and back, depending on the distance between the hotel and In De Vrede. What do you think is the best way to proceed here?
2. The following day, Tuesday, I'm going to Florenville to visit Orval, in a journey over 5 hours.  So, would you advise me to leave from Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper, Vleteren or whatever?

If you have any tips on beer stores or beers you like to drink that I could buy, I'd be grateful.  
And I hope you can help me clear up my doubts about my itinerary and help me plan my trip.",1728067678.0,2024-10-08 18:14:13

I recently received an email from both AA and JAL saying my flight was changed. In the JAL email, they proposed to have my flight destination changed to HND instead, which would be great for me. I went through their process and booked the new flight. 

However this new flight is NOT in partnership with AA. At the confirmation page, I receive the following message (screenshot). When I check in my AA app, I see both flights been included (where the JAL flight doesn’t have a corresponding AA flight number)

t3_1fvzqax,China in July - 15 days itinerary question,"Hello everyone!

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

t3_1fw509b,Morocco 9-day itinerary tips,"Hi everyone! Me and my partner are going to Morocco for a 9-day trip in November (including travel days), it's our first time there and I would like some tips! It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

Osaka to Shanghai Pudong = Peach Aviation (arriving 24:20)

Shanghai Pudong to Bangkok = Thai Lion Air (departing 02:40)

Layover time: 2 hours 20 mins

- Since we don't have any check in luggage, is it possible to just go to the transfer desk and get a boarding pass there? (Note: Thai Lion Air doesn't allow online check in for international flights according to their website)

- If not, do we have to apply for a transit visa just so we can go through immigration and customs and then check in again at the Thai Lion Air counter?

- OR can we just go straight to immigration and customs and they will issue us a transit visa there considering we are not leaving the airport and only getting out of airside so we can check in again?

We booked our hotel in June because it was a pretty decent price for one of those “plan your fall getaway today” things on the hotel website, but looking now, the current cost of the room has decreased a non-inconsequential amount for us. 

This is all through the hotels website, and we booked with 100% free cancellation, no deposit, so it’s not like we’re wanting to match a competitors price or get money back or something. 

With how variable constant rate changes are becoming, and how rapidly they can swing, what is everyone doing about this? Would you keep your reservation the same? Call the hotel and see if they’ll adjust? Book online on the new rate and cancel the old reservation? ",1728051226.0,2024-10-08 18:14:29

t3_1fwax5k,My experience traveling internationally with a drone for the first time.,"I recently (September 2024) traveled to Greece with my new DJI Mini 3 with a short layover in Istanbul, both on the way there and back. I flew on Turkish Airlines. This was not my first time traveling internationally, but it was the first time with that type of equipment and I was utterly stressed out about it. I purchased the drone specifically for said trip. I made the mistake of going down a Reddit rabbit hole and all it did was make me feel more uneasy about it to the extent that I was ready to leave the drone behind. I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone. I even went through the painstaking process of registering the drone in Greece and I felt even that was a complete waste of my time. Just thought I would share my experience.

I want to take my time while also seeing as many cool things as I can before I fly back to the my side of the globe.

  
I've got some ideas of what I want to see: definitely spend time exploring London and Berlin, stop off somewhere in the Netherlands, look into stopping off in Scotland or France (but I bet it will be very cold and dark in Scotland!). I'm super interested in the history and the culture, so looking for museums and old architecture, and anything else that will be a fun memory.

  
So my big questions are:

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

t3_1fvrfir,Urgent: Bulgarian airlines Lost Luggage Tag,"Hey!

I went on a work related trip to Sofia (Bulgaria) and I flew home to Lisbon (Portugal) two days ago. After arriving in Lisbon, I wasn’t able to find my bag and realized it had been lost.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

We're looking for romance, privacy, healing. A day spent reading, strolling a trail, and having healthy food would be the perfect day.

Would also love: horses or other animals, no kids, yoga

Do not want/need: party vibes, stuffy, corporate, cell service, internet, TV, alcohol

I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille.

t3_1fvj3pm,Renting a car in the US as a Canadian and I have some questions.,"I am flying to Vegas next week where I have a whole 12 day trip planned out with my girlfriend. My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out. 

- assuming my flights go without delay, I will arrive at the airport at 10:30pm and my car rental from fox is scheduled to be picked up at 11:30pm. I am worried I didn’t give myself enough time to deal with finding my checked bags and dealing with customs or whatever. Can I just call the place in advance if I’m running late?

- We are scheduled to stay at the Luxor hotel for the first 3 nights but we will only most likely be checking in at like midnight - 1am the first night. Is this worth calling them in advance?

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

I have also emailed the various embassies and consulates but 1) it's Friday and 2) I'm flying out next week and not currently in the UK, so keen to get as much info as I can from as many sources 😅

Although I see this in their local and Regional plans, the reason I ask this is more or less to do with NordVPN. I know Saily was created by NordVPN which you may of heard has had multiple reports this year saying it doesn't work anymore.

I've been recommended to get an eSIM in addition to a VPN for China.

I'm looking at going to go to multiple countries around Asia, China being one. So I have been looking at Asia/Regional plans with good amount of data for good pricing.

I'm looking for one that will allow me to use Whatsapp and/messenger to call family back home (and having both an eSIM and VPN were highly recommended). So I'm wondering if Saily has been working fine for people even if NordVPN isn't?

I'm from Aotearoa (New Zealand) so the idea of a global eSIM is a bit tricky to find at a good price.

I budgeted about 6K total for the trip, is what I have leftover enough to have good food/cool experiences with?

For reference, just booked my flights via Delta and Aer Lingus for about $2500 total round trip for both me and my S/O, coming from Chicago. Booked all of our lodging for about $800 total for 6 nights. We’re staying in East Lothian (East Liston for 2 nights &amp; Haddington 4 nights).

So far as getting around is concerned, we won’t have a car. I’m hoping to rely on both ride share and the trains for travel around the coast (North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady, Musselburgh, Dunbar, etc). Any suggestions on what is most cost effective? Is this a reliable way to get around relatively efficiently? Obviously we’ll plan to do a lot of walking around in each village/area, but getting to each area is my main focus here. Is Uber reliable in that area? Are the trains fairly inexpensive? 

Still looking for cool pubs, restaurants, sights, etc in each of the places I mentioned. Obviously we’ll stumble on some hidden gems just walking around, but any suggestions are much appreciated!

Just fyi, I’d like to exclude Edinburgh for the most part. But I’d love for someone to change my mind! I’ve heard there’s a lot of tourist traps around the city and with that comes more excessive spending which we’re trying to avoid.

I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ?

i’ll travel solo and have a budget of \~2500. My non-négociable is : nothing COLD, for me winter holidays are to go as much as possible from the gloomy weather, a little break from the winter depression.  
i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

1) Seoul (especially some of its neighborhoods, like mangwon, seongsu, mullae, seochon, hapjeon and why not, myeongdong, hongdae and the hanok village)

2) Gwangju or Gyeongju, still haven’t decided yet

3) Busan

Really wanted to visit Pohang too…I might also go to Jeju (in another moment, SK is part of a 3-month trip in Asia). Incheon would be in the list too😂
As you can see, I am extremely all over the place except for Seoul.
What would you recommend for a two weeks trip? I prefer historical, artsy and not so touristy places (with a few exceptions since it’s my first time there) for the most part. I love markets too.
Thank you so much!🤓🤩",1727968296.0,2024-10-08 18:14:29

t3_1fvpk0a,"Custom ""Foreign Tourist Driver"" magnet sticker a bad idea?","I will be going to the US and renting a car. It will be the first time for me to drive on the right so I thought of having a custom ""Foreign Tourist Driver"" magnet sticker made and placed on the rear bumper and rear side doors on both sides. (Its a mouthful I know but ""Foreign Driver"" may imply I am a foreigner residing permanently in the US and ""Tourist Driver"" could imply I'm from another state)

Is this a bad idea? Will it give ideas to opportunistic robbers? My main concern is if I make some mistakes while driving, the sticker would give drivers behind me a hint of caution.

Update: Got it. I think I will use “New Driver” or “Student Driver”. I got the idea for a tourist sticker from a recent practice in Hokkaido, Japan

https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160416/p2a/00m/0na/005000c

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting. Again, we are really wanting Colorado but I just worry about the altitude sickness. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! ",1727976775.0,2024-10-08 18:14:29

t3_1fvpzkk,Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1727943901.0,2024-10-08 18:14:29

t3_1fv2xqr,Has anyone from outside Germany ever processed a paper DB (Deutsche Bahn) compensation claim?,"So long story short DB owes me some €300 (cancelled trains and overnight stranding). It's been 2 months and all that has happened so far is this:

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point).",1727943868.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? ",1727895112.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45

t3_1fuyq94,Applying for Japanese eVisa on applied PGWP status.,"Earlier this year, my friends (permanent residents of Canada) and I (a recent university graduate with a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) application in process) planned a trip to Japan. We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

PS: We are residents of Whitehorse, Yukon and the closest Japanese Consulate Office we have is either Vancouver or Calgary.

t3_1fvcgne,Anyone else notice that Southwest leaves the seatbelt sign on for basically the whole flight? ,"In the past I’ve almost exclusively flown Southwest but lately for various reasons I’ve flown on several other carriers both within the US and internationally. I’ve noticed other airlines like American, United, BA, and Lufthansa all turn their seatbelt sign off before even reaching cruising altitude. This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence. Anyone else notice this?

Edit: for everyone replying “you should keep it on anyway when seated” I 100% agree with you and do that myself. I’m only talking about getting up to use the restroom, grab something from the overhead bin, etc. ",1727974645.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45

t3_1fv2tyc,EU and Schengen travel ban with travel thereafter ,"Hi there. 

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen? 

Exhausted google searches and relevant sites. Any information would be appreciated.

t3_1fun8lm,16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

t3_1fuh6qq,Three weeks in Taiwan this November,"1. Is November a good time to go?  Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;
Paying for a parking ticket in Verona (through post office);
Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened?

t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place",1727805935.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you.",1727936827.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

This is between October 21-26 (which is when I need to be back in Amsterdam). Any suggestions for one or two destinations I could visit during this time? It will be a solo trip. I'm already visiting Hamburg on the way to Berlin, and I've been to Prague. Haven't been anywhere in Germany prior to this, or to the east or north of Germany.

Suggestions I've received so far were Cologne, Munich (though a bit out of the way), and doing a short haul flight to Copenhagen or Warsaw. Curious for any more recommendations. ",1727886544.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45

t3_1fujtnq,Rabbie's Tours versus self-guided Highlands Roadtrip to see Scotland - experiences?,"My husband and I (both 30, from the US) are planning a late April/Early May trip to Scotland next year for about a week. We're debating on doing self-guided highlands roadtrip, renting a car and everything. I typically enjoy this type of planning but am mentally spent, and open to leaving it in the hands of experts. I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

t3_1fuj9po,Looking for Advice on my Rough St. Lucia Itinerary,"Hi all, my partner and I (man/woman) are planning to do a 7 day trip to St. Lucia this December. The rough plan is as follows:

Arrive at Hewanorra Airport, take a taxi or some form of transport to Castries. Stay for 3 or 4 nights. Couple of beach days, exploring Castries, trying the different food, museums, etc. Maybe a night out at a bar/club if that's even a thing. Possibly take the ferry to Fort de France for a night in Martinique, not sure if this is worth it or how it would work.

Take some form of transport to Soufriere to stay there for the remainder of the trip, so 3 or 4 nights. Beach days, exploring the town, and we want to hike the Gran Piton. Then fly back out through Hewanorra.

t3_1ftl7an,Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.",1727780037.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45

t3_1fu4hfm,Solo traveler planning Alsace wine + foodie trip 12/2 - 12/5. Recommendations please!,"I'm a 38/F planning a solo trip to Alsace in early December and am trying to figure out my itinerary including where to stay, eat, and the best options for visiting wineries! I'm hoping for some recommendations on how to cut costs where possible and spend more where it counts.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne. Historically I've done semi-private tours but I'd definitely be open to saving money if I can get around by myself either via car or the Kut'Zig - I'm not sure if there are wineries that are easy to access/open to the public or by appointment to someone outside the industry.

I also would love to hit up the Strasbourg Christmas market for maybe an afternoon, but wine, food, and wandering/exploring are higher priorities for this trip vs. more ""touristy"" activities like visiting castles, etc. 

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access. Wherever I stay, I'll mainly be there just to sleep but it's important that it's safe and clean, but would flex for the right experience (again as long as I can make up for added costs elsewhere!)

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days? 

Budget: im hoping to get the price under 2.000$ just for this week for hotels, food and daily activities.

Since we are probably not going there anytime soon anymore we would like to add as much as possible.

t3_1fuk8pp,Excess carry on luggage causing problems,We have been travelling across the globe for the last 7 weeks and the boarding process has been repeatedly fraught because of people getting on with carry on luggage well in excess of what is allowed. The airlines appear to do nothing about it and these selfish passengers (who don’t want to wait at baggage claim like the rest of us) have the cheek to get upset when there is no room for their carry on in the overhead lockers.

t3_1fucwpf,Boarding pass not assigned at check in (online),"Is it just me or have others noticed that there airlines seem less likely to assign a boarding pass when you do online check in? Seems like I always used to check in online, get my boarding pass, and then show up at the airport ready to go.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass. But that means having to go and line up at the  bag drop line and that can take an hour at least. As I have no bags to drop that makes for a very frustrating experience!

  
Edit: this is flights to/from US, UK, France, Netherlands.

This seems like a new frustration and has happened on BA, Air France and KLM on my last few flights.

Is there a trick I am missing here? Let me know if this is just normal nowadays or or if there's something I am doing wrong.

Example airline email:

Dear passenger, 

You have successfully checked in! Please note: We cannot provide you the boarding pass online now, you need to obtain it at the airport.

**How to obtain your boarding pass:**

* Come early to the airport on the day of your flight to make sure you have enough time to obtain your boarding pass.
* Go to a check-in counter, even if you travel with hand baggage only.
* Once all necessary steps are taken, one of our agents will provide you with a boarding pass to go through security checkpoints and to board your flight.",1727864783.0,2024-10-08 18:14:45
t3_1fu7qpc,Iberia Missed Connection and Cancelled Flight ,"Hello Everyone, 

Long time lurker and first time poster looking for some guidance please. 

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

t3_1fu4o30,What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible. 

I posted on my Instagram story what happened and had 13 ppl reaching out that they went through the same thing with AirSerbia :(((((/ one of my friend who is originally from Belgrade sent me an email address that is at their LOST AND FOUND office door in Belgrade ( ???? ) and after I sent an email there, they responded that my baggage was still in Belgrade ( ???? ). When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!!

t3_1ft24dp,"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

To travelers who have been to KL before, is it worth trying to stay in a hostel or should I just play it safe and start off in a hotel? 

Thanks in advance for all your input.",1727801981.0,2024-10-08 18:15:02

We wanted to take a quick trip to Fiji from Auckland. From what I am reading, February isn’t a great time to visit Fiji (super rainy / potential cyclones). 

Should we still risk it? It will only be for a few days. Or are we better off spending more time in New Zealand and maybe going to Matapouri Beach / Wharariki Beach or elsewhere for beachy days? 

For more context — We really wanted to visit Fiji because it’s quite far from Canada and we will likely never go back to that part of the world in the near future (or ever). ",1727790404.0,2024-10-08 18:15:02

Room booked at the Dubai International Hotel at the airport. My checked luggage will be tagged through to the final destination and I will obtain all boarding passes needed when at the origin airport. 

Question: Will I be able leave and return to airport hotel to sleep before my flight? I know I’ll have to clear customs to leave and that is fine. However, I’m reading conflicting information about not being able to return to the hotel until 3 hours prior to flight when check-in opens. I’m assuming I will already be checked in given that I’ll have my boarding pass to final destination and my luggage is checked all the way through. So, I’m not sure if hotel access only 3 hours before flight applies to me. I’d really like to explore in the afternoon and return around 10 pm.

t3_1fu03t7,Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?",1727819290.0,2024-10-08 18:15:02

t3_1fst66x,"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",1727695522.0,2024-10-08 18:15:02
t3_1fso6rm,12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

Day 1 (Oct 13): PM - arrive late to Montreux from Geneva, dinner. 

Day 2: AM - Walk to Chillon Castle, boat tour if time/weather line up. 
PM: Lavaux vineyards walk (Cully -Saint Saphorin). Dinner there/Montreux. 

Day 3: Gruyeres - chateau du Gruyeres, HR Giger Museum (we are Alien fans lol), etc. Train back to Montreux/dinner 

Day 4: AM - train to Zermatt 
PM - Stellisee lake weather permitting/Zermatt bopping 

Day 5: AM - Early Gornergrat, Riffelsee, proposal 🥳. Matterhorn glacier if time/weather 
PM: BEAUSite spa. Dinner at Omnia. 

Day 6: AM - train to Wengen. 
PM: Mannlichen-kleine schedegg if weather permits/lauterbrunnen valley option 

Day 7: (all options) Murren North face hiking, gimmewald, Eiger Trail, schilthorn, jungfraujoch

Day 8: see day 7. Mix/match accordingly 

Day 9: AM - lauterbrunnen valley 1 last time. Train to Lucerne. 
PM - bop around Lucerne 

Day 10: Lucerne City exploring. Old village, museums, boating weather permitting, etc. 

Day 11: rigi/pilatus/stoos ridge (still deciding - open to suggestions). 

Day 12: AM: train to Zurich (maybe stop in Zug for lunch??). 
PM: bop around Zurich 

Day 13: Zurich exploring, museums etc. 

Day 14: depart 

Weather may dictate some of these days. Have thought about training to Bern on any rainy days or other locations. We are pretty flexible and enjoy both hiking and city exploring. Have lived in Colorado for many years and understand October hiking will be layers, beanies, gloves.

I’m in a bit of a stressful situation and would appreciate any advice. I’m traveling to the United States soon, and I applied for the ESTA for myself and my family members, including my cousin and uncle. However, their applications were denied because I mistakenly answered a question about their health conditions incorrectly.

I’ve since learned that I can reapply for their ESTA applications after 24 hours, but I’m really anxious about whether this will work out.

	1.	Can I submit new applications for them with the same passport numbers, or will their previous denial affect the new applications?
	2.	How can I ensure that I provide the correct information this time?
	3.	Is there a chance that the system will still show them as “not authorized” when I try to reapply?

Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Something that's important to me is possibly being able to get assistance. I'm autistic, I can take care of myself so it's not a necessity but it'd help a lot. I know the sunflower lanyard is known with KLM but TAP doesn't seem to be trained with it. I'm not sure if it's known with the domestic airlines in Brazil.

I also have some questions about the São Paulo/Rio airports. What's it like having to switch from international to domestic flights? Do I have to check in all over again, is it far away? Is it easy to find English speaking personnel? This is one of my boyfriends' worries since I don't speak PT very well.

I saw I'd possibly have to do a ""self-transfer"" in Lisbon, what is this like? Also, does anyone know if TAPs prices ever lower again? The price recently got raised and hasn't gone down again.

To me the TAP flights seem easier, times are perfect (good layovers too!), but I'm not sure how reliable they are. I read a lot about baggage rules, but I don't mind putting in extra effort to make sure I'm not going over the limits. To be honest, I'd do that no matter the airline.

Is this too good to be true or a scam? I don't want to book her ticket, have her show up at the airport, and this isn't even legit. The Indian embassy is useless here too, as there is no number to call, and if you make an appointment, they can barely speak English or convey anything properly.

I said how? I was told to come to this line and it's going to my destination. He said you missed your bus. And no, I did not come late. I was an hour in half early, my bus literally left minutes before. I asked can he please let me on the bus he said ""how much you got"" and was saying other very rude stuff to me but I digress. I lied and said I only have $20 so I gave him cash for him to let me on the bus. 

I contacted greyhound only wanting to get a partial refund of $20 on my ticket but they are of course saying it's nonrefundable. How is this my fault at all? Their app clearly said get in line D or E and the employee told me line D. The employees didn't even do calls for which bus is going where. You just had to assume what like to get in.

t3_1ft5pl2,7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)",1727728123.0,2024-10-08 18:15:02

t3_1ftju3z,Travel and tobacco question ,"Hi,

I have a question regarding a recent flight I got
From Hong Kong to Melbourne, Australia. 

I attempted to purchase 100 grams of tobacco from Hong Kong airport, well aware of the 25g limit when entering into Australia. 

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

Sincerely,

Highly anxious Male, 26, currently smoking their cigarettes. ",1727774295.0,2024-10-08 18:15:02

Alternatively, if it's during the day (and it is) and I can travel first class by train (and no need to pre-book - just turn up and get the next train - there's one every hour), then should I be okay?

Arrival: BCN 

Direct flight   A300-200 

  
**My parent's flight to Barcelona**

1. they purchased a ticket months ago. One way ticket.

**Problem** 

1. Cancelation  A day before the flight, the initial flight was canceled, and they got re-assigned to a different flight day later. 

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. ",1727729597.0,2024-10-08 18:15:02

1.	Split my time evenly between Madrid and another city - I’m thinking Barcelona, Valencia, or Seville, or even crossing into Porto (though I’ve been there before)
2.	Stay in Madrid for the full week and take day/overnight trips to surrounding towns (Toledo, Sergovia, Salamanca).

My first day off will be next Friday (11/10) and my flight home from Madrid to London is 3pm the next Saturday (19/10). I’ve heard that 8 days is too much time for Madrid but I’m worried that things will be too rushed if I visit a second city but only spend 4 days in each.

Because of the flight schedule, I must start and end the trip in Madrid. I like walking and street photography, and I can speak basic Spanish. I also want to keep costs low so I’ll probably be staying in hostels for the entire trip.

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations?",1727714204.0,2024-10-08 18:15:18
t3_1fszsve,Madeira or Azores (sao Miguel),"Hi Reddit! 
Looking for some insight on where to go in late Dec/early January. Got a group of 8 adults that are an annoyingly difficult mix to plan for.  Half the group can’t swim and want to hike more / adventurous excursions. The other half wants to chill by a heated pool and do nothing basically (they’re not into hikes but would probably be fine with some tours that drive to beautiful views). Also mostly a vegetarian group, not sure on food options for both but assuming Madeira has more variety. The trip would be about 8 days

t3_1fszcqk,Do I Need a Transit Visa for a Long Layover in Frankfurt (Over 24 Hours)?,"Hey everyone,

I have two flights booked for my upcoming trip, and I’m trying to figure out if I need a transit visa for Frankfurt. Here are the details:

* **Flight 1**: Cairo to Frankfurt, arriving at 5:25 AM on October 29th.
* **Flight 2**: Frankfurt to Haneda (Japan), departing at 11:30 AM on October 30th.

That’s more than a 24-hour layover in Frankfurt. Both flights are part of a single itinerary/ticket, not two separate tickets.

I have an Egyptain passport.

My final destination is Japan, and I already have a valid Japanese visa. I’ve checked some visa rules, but it’s still unclear whether the long layover means I need a transit visa.

Has anyone had a similar experience, or can someone clarify if a visa is required for this kind of long layover in Germany?

t3_1ft4exz,Is it a good idea to visit Tbilisi as an East Asian family in late Dec? ,"Hi! Me (F23) and my parents (\~60) are looking to go on a trip for the holidays \~Dec 23-Jan 1 and are really curious about Tbilisi/surrounding areas. Thank you for reading over this slightly long post as I would love to hear from locals/people who have visited before. Would love some pretty honest/frank responses if it isn't a good idea to visit, for whatever reason.

* I haven't really seen a lot online about East Asians visiting Tbilisi, so was wondering if there's any air of hostility towards visitors who are Chinese. We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year. We only speak English (and Chinese but obviously won't be helpful in Georgia!)

t3_1fru0rh,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",1727575803.0,2024-10-08 18:15:18
t3_1fswfii,Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia. 

I would love any feedback, location suggestions, or just to hear your favorite places to spend a week! Thanks!!",1727705308.0,2024-10-08 18:15:18

Admittedly, I've fallen a bit behind on planning something (I get married in May 2025). My fiance and I have another trip planned in March 2025 (Mexico), so I'm looking at either February or April for when to travel.

Among my friends, we've already done Vegas, Destin, Nashville, Charleston, hometown, and many who have elected to do nothing (multiple elopements and a Covid wedding). It's a group of roughly 10-12 guys. We are all in our early 30s. We're into good food and drinks, games (any kind, I've seen them turn a bottle cap into a drinking game), professional (and unprofessional?) sports, beaches, pools, and water activities. Not big clubbers, golfers, or hikers.

Personally, I love to cook, I like a boat and a lake, to visit an art museum, I tend to be nerdier, and my games of preference are card and board game.

Things that have been batted around in conversation: Ireland (too far for the dads), Montreal, Banff, Lake Tahoe, All Inclusive Resort (don't know where), Lakeside Cabin (don't know where), Austin, Chicago. Not sure if those primers help!

* Dates: February or April 2025
* Locations: Canada, USA, Central America, Caribbean
* Group Details: 10-12, 30ish yo Males, located on East Coast USA
* Vibes: Beers, Good Food, Games/Group Activities, Water (a plus, not necessary)
* Not Vibes: Clubs, Golf Courses, Appalachian Trail

I live in a city and prefer nature when I travel.

  
Given all of this and my late October timeframe, any ideas on where to go?

Ideas are either:
A) Somewhere super relaxing but hot so it’s a change and we can go in a pool / chill outdoors. 
In my head this would mean going quite far to say Bali or Mexico…

B) Say f*** it and be those people that take a baby to Japan because I’m dying to go.

C) Road trip round the states
Can’t decide if this is stupid given we can only drive 2 hours before taking breaks with the baby…

t3_1ftfa1m,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",1727755390.0,2024-10-08 18:15:18

Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

t3_1ft0ar7,"I need some ""comfort"" advice and some ways to up my travel game","I have been travelling a lot the last few years ( 5 cities in canada, Cuba twice, Italy, Portland/San fransisco, Greece, Germany and this coming april, France) and have learned a LOT about efficientcy in packing, my personal travel style and what I need and dont need when I travel.  I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.  Even if I pack clothes for almost every day I am travelling its inevitable you wear something more than once so I figure why even worry about having so much?",1727714886.0,2024-10-08 18:15:18

Am a UK citizen and am aware UK Foreign Office advises having 6 months validity on passport when entering Mexico (as this is the longest you can stay as a tourist).

t3_1fsme5l,NYC itinerary suggestions —no budget,"I’m hoping people can give some suggestions on what activities they would do in NYC if there was no budget (within reason). 

My mother-in-law went through an extremely difficult divorce and lost her house and will be going to NYC with my wife and I this December and we want to make it the most memorable trip possible (and covering all the costs). 

Although I said no budget, we don’t actually have unlimited money so it would only be one of each archetypal activity (museum, play, fine dining, tour(?)). I just don’t want options excluded automatically on the basis of expense. We’re open to something like spending 50% more on the margin for a 10% better experience. 

I was thinking about one fine dining experience, one live show (broadway?), some local cheaper eats (una pizza napolita), one of the art museums (met) but open to any ideas that aren’t usually circulated on the sub for cost reasons. 

Edit:
Adding some suggestions below that have piqued our interest so its easier to track. 

Day 1:

- Dumbo + Brooklyn Bridge
- 2/3 star dinner ( MIL choice)

Day 2:
- Tea service at plaza hotel (near us)
- Spa day on governors island (or shibui spa TBD)

Day 3:
- Museum (transit in brooklyn or met)
- Lunch / offtime pizza at L’industrie
- Rockettes (2x rec so going with it)

Day 4:
- display windows on 5th ave ahead of opera
- Opera (magic flute)

t3_1fsoc62,Vietnam Itinerary Help (13 Nights),"Hi, we will be in Vietnam 13th-26th October (13 nights), we had an idea on where we wanted to go and how many nights to spend in each but when it comes to actually planning it, I am not sure if we should drop Hoi An so it doesn’t feel rushed. We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)
17th: Overnight train to Ninh Binh
18th: Ninh Binh (arrive in morning from train)
19th: Ninh Binh
20th: Return to Hanoi (for Ha Long next morning)
21st: Ha Long Cruise (overnight) 
22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa
25th: Hanoi
26th: Flight home (evening)

This results in a total 5 nights in Hanoi, 2 nights in Hoi An, 2 nights in Ninh Binh, 1 night in Ha Long, 2 nights in Sapa, and 1 on a train. Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

t3_1fsqxf2,Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!",1727685997.0,2024-10-08 18:15:18

t3_1fsm1qw,Compare Flighty Vs Tripsy,"Hello everyone,

  
I'm an avid traveler. I usually like to keep my flights tracked through apps. I'm not too concerned with tracking hotel stays or car rental stuff, but it's good when I need it. I usually stay at Hilton hotels and use Avis for car rentals. Unless something unusual makes me deviate from either brand, I'm sticking to them. Flights on the other hand, are usually across many airlines. I like to keep a history of my flights too, just to see where I've been, so I do like the passport feature from Flighty.

I recently discovered Tripsy, I like the UI and I like the general itinerary record. I see that there is a flight/visited record feature, so that's a nice feature. This app reminds me of TripIt. I've used TripIt before, I didn't like the UI though. I didn't like the feel of the TripIt app, but I did love their website, which I ended up using far more than the app. One really great feature, although it's a pro feature, is the expense record keeping of Tripsy. It's really nice to see that immediately and not have to do that on the budgeting app.

I could go on and on about both apps. Again, I've used TripIt, I'm favoring Tripsy out of those two. But what are your thoughts of flight/itenarary keeping of both Flighty and Tripsy? Specifically, I'm thinking of getting a pro membership, so which one feels like you're getting your monies worth?

t3_1froz5i,Money comments on having just returned from a trip to the UK.,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks in the UK, mostly touring by train and car. Wonderful trip but I noticed two things I didn't expect.

The UK was expensive! I would rank it right up there with Switzerland. We stayed in three star hotels and B&amp;B's, rated 8.0 or higher on Booking. We paid US$350 per night in London and Edinburgh, US$250 or less in the countryside, breakfast included. Restaurant prices were high too, we paid pound for dollar. Meaning that a pasta dish would cost GBP20, which is US$26. A burger might be GBP16 = US$21. Gasoline cost around US$8.50 per US gallon. Entrance fees for attractions were high, up significantly from the Rick Steve's prices we saw in a four year old book. Like US$40 to see Stonehenge. Museums in London were still free.

British restaurants have caught the tipping disease. They use hand held. point of sale devices for card payments (normal) and the bill almost always included an ""optional service charge"" of 10%. The server would point out that it's optional but there it was, already added into the bill. Incidentally, quite a few restaurants, pubs and deli's are cashless. It was payment by card only. If you go make sure you have a chip card. (Pay toilets in the parks cost 20 pence to use and no longer accept coins. You have to tap your credit card -- chip -- and you're in. It shows up as a 27 cent charge on your CC bill.)

Transportation: The train was expensive too, although we didn't try to book ahead to save money and did walk-up ticket purchases. London to York cost US$94 per person, second class. Car rental was a pleasant surprise. We reserved with Enterprise from the US five months before the trip and were pleased with both the price and the service. And you don't need an Oyster card for the London underground anymore. You can use a chip card in the same way and you get the same fare as with an Oyster card. You just tap in and tap out.

Sometimes we had to wait an extra hour or 2 for them. One day my GF felt she had to take care of F31 after she went out all night drinking and was not feeling good the next day. My GF went out with us the next day but then left early after it started to rain to check up on F31 and stayed in all day and then regretted not being able to see the city that day as it was our only chance to see the city. 

After the trip my GF and I discussed how we felt inviting others and compared it to our 2023 trip. We both agreed that it was more fun when it was just us and agreed if we do one next year it would be just us 2.  It juts seems her and I are just compatible when travelling and we dont feel the need to have to entertain or adjust to others. Most of my friends though arent that compatible travellers with their partners. Like they'd rather do a boys trip (or a group trip) and the boys go one side and the girls go the other. Its made me wonder how common it is for partners to enjoy trips (especially long trips) just when its the two of them. 

Do you like doing big trips when it's just you and your partner or would you rather a group trip? ",1728404382.0,2024-10-08 19:56:05

t3_1fza192,"What are some of your favourite parts of your country to travel, and why? ","I’ve become a happy domestic traveller for various reasons— including personal preference at this stage in life.

So I’ve been wondering— is there any part of your country that is a favourite to you for travelling, and why? 

For me it’s hard to choose one, so it would be a toss-up between Yorkshire or the West Country in England (inc. Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall). 

I love visiting Yorkshire for its many friendly, multicultural and creative communities, the world-class curries and range of other foods, and nature. Woodlands (tree cover is really low in Britain, sadly), purple heather moors, greenery, cosy towns, beautiful skies, and probably the most crisp air in the country. Also iconic architecture, like Whitby Abbey and the Piece Hall. 

The West Country is another favourite. Granite sea cliffs, pristine white and red-sand beaches, glittering turquoise seas. The plants can be so fragrant - like honeysuckle, dog roses, and wild garlic. 

All in all, I like Yorkshire as it rolls some of England’s best qualities into one place: diversity, heritage, nature, community character, etc. And the West Country is best for my aroma and colour therapy. 🩵🤍🩷💚💜

Anyway, I look forward to reading where you like to spend time in your country! ",1728420064.0,2024-10-08 19:56:05

t3_1fy6r62,"A week's long trip to Iceland, September 2024","For a while now I wanted to go to Iceland, and finally did it last month, and I have enjoyed it so much!

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much). 

The pictures, in order, are from: Seljalandsfoss, Solheimajokull *2, Vik, Reynisfjara beach, Selvallafoss, Northern Lights in a place close to Hvammsvik, Kirkjufell, Londrangar, Budakirkja, Gulfoss, Kerid Crater, Geysir, Reykjavik and Hvammsvik. ",1728305213.0,2024-10-08 19:56:05

I'm a relatively young woman (F26) and I want to find a safe way to go to Uyuni for a day. I will be in La Paz, and I have 3 full days/2 nights to go Uyuni.

I'm considering either to fly to Uyuni and book a day tour to see the salt flats, or take an overnight bus but I have a few concerns with either method:

* Safety: Obviously the primary concern here, I'm not too worried about the airport, but more so being at the bus stop at night time, taxis to get to the bus stop in the evening etc.
* Flight delays: Has anyone done the flight and missed their salt flats tour or just been waiting too long?
* Luggage: Uyuni will be the last thing I do on my trip to South America, and I do presume I will have a decent amount of luggage (nothing too crazy but a regular luggage bag + backpack). I'll be starting in La Paz, and I hope to finish there too. I won't be at the same hotel for start/end but I can contact the hotel to hopefully hold a decent amount of my belongings.
* Time: I'd be nice to have a bit more time in La Paz, unless it is a bit dry and not much to do, I'd probably want a bit more of time there, than Uyuni. Or is it worth taking a flight one day to Uyuni, another to Sucre/Cochabamba, and then back to La Paz?

t3_1fz6a3d,Feedback on 3-week Mexico itinerary,"Hi there - my SO and I are visiting Mexico from mid Nov to early Dec. We will be there for just over 3 weeks, which hopefully gives us enough time to explore 2-3 regions and have a good variety of experiences (cities, beaches, etc.). This is our high-level itinerary so far:

**Days 1-5: Mexico City**

* Including day trip to Teotihuacán

**Days 5-8: Bacalar** (fly to Chetumal from Mexico City, then bus to Bacalar)

**Days 8-11: Valladodid** (ADO bus from Bacalar)

* Including day trips to Chichén Itzá/Rosalia Chay Chuc/cenotes)

**Days 11-14: Merida** (ADO bus from Valladodid)

* Including day trips to Uxmal/Ek-Balam/cenotes

**Days 14-17: Oaxaca City** (fly from Merida)

* Including day trips to a mezcalería/Monte Albán/Hierve el Agua/Pueblos Mancomunados

**Days 17-21: Puerto Escondido** (ADO bus from Oaxaca)

* Including day trips to Mazunte/Zipolite/Chacahua National Park

**Days 21-23: Mexico City**

Have done quite a lot of research but wanted to check with those in the know if this itinerary makes sense or if we've missed anything! Some specific notes/questions:

* We've booked flights in and out of Mexico City (from Europe), besides that pretty open so far
* Have already cut a few places out (e.g. Puebla/Cholula) so the trip feels relaxing, but is this still too much? Or anything amazing missing?
* Don't plan to hire a car - happy to do it, but it doesn't seem necessary for the places we're visiting?
* We like exploring cities and walking (museums, markets, etc.), LOVE food and drink, and appreciate natural beauty
* Want some beach time but not into all-inclusive resorts/sleepy towns with nothing else to do - so thought Puerto Escondido/Bacalar were good options (aware Bacalar is not a beach, but think it counts as lazing by the water vibes)
* For beach we also considered Holbox (but were put off by bad reviews of sewage problems/flooding, power outages, mosquitoes, bad service, etc.) and Isla Mujeres/Cozumel (but hear they are too touristy/similar to Cancun/Tulum) - any other perspectives on this?
* Neither of us are particularly into archaeology/visiting ruins - does this mean we have too much time in Merida/Valladolid? Thinking we might just visit 1 or 2 of Chichén Itzá/Uxmal/Ek Balam and not all of them (similarly with the cenotes)
* We also briefly considered doing Jalisco (Guadalajara, Tequila, Puerto Vallarta, etc.) instead of Yucatan

Any thoughts would be super appreciated :) thank you in advance!",1728410563.0,2024-10-08 19:56:05

t3_1fz3gcx,Grand Canyon Sept. 2025 and bringing 65 year old dad - Airports and Duration Questions,"Hi - So, I've done most but not all of my homework, including the NPS site, \~2 dozen reddit posts and a few YT videos.  I'm looking for some additional guidance on optimizing our trip and making sure that we are not forced to rush around.

**Trip Objective and Background:**   
GC has always been on my dad's list, we were initially planning to do the 3day river trip offered by Western Expeditions, but I'm too concerned with my dad's health to put us in a position like that. He's not obese, but he has a heart condition and we just do not want to put ourselves in that type of situation if we can avoid it.   
  
The objective is to optimize for shorter, less strenuous hikes, helicopter tours, mule rides and other activities where the physical activity is limited in time (say &lt;3hours) and in strain (limited elevation gain, dicey pathways, etc).  We are very much into scenic drives, I'm not concerned with the 4-5 hour drive between the SR and NR, for example.  If there are opportunities for catch &amp; release fly fishing, even better.

We are very interested in Phoenix, Sedona, Flagstaff and even Page.  Vegas is less of a thing for us, but if it makes sense to fly in/out of Vegas, then so be it.  We fully intend on renting a car, if that isn't obvious.  We don't really drink but we very much enjoy a good meal, so I'd prioritize the towns/cities offering more in the way of food over say bars and nightlife.

I realize that there are other opportunities for parks, such as heading into Utah, and while that is certainly appealing my main goal is to get my dad to see the GC.

**Trip Dates and Duration:**   
We are targeting early September 2025, we are flexible and can bring in to August but September is preferred.  We'd like to stick to 3-4 days, say we land on a Thursday morning and then fly out on a Sunday evening.

**Accommodations:**   
Traditional lodging but we are certainly interested in a non-primitive camping option, if it makes sense.   

**The information I am most interested in right now:**  
1) Given the above, what is the most ideal flight plan, where to fly into, where to fly out of?  Currently thinking fly in to Vegas, then depart from Phoenix.  Not opposed to using the same airport if it makes more sense.  
  
2) Should we plan for 3 nights, 4 days (Thur, Fri, Sat night, leave Sunday afternoon)? Is this enough time given our objectives?  Say 2 nights in/around the canyon with the remainder spread between the other locations (Sedona, Flagstaff, etc...)

3) Is there a compelling reason to go towards end of Aug, early Sept versus end of Sept?

* They've been to CA, WA, FL, VT, and Oregon quite a few times, so would prefer something else
* They prefer smaller towns over very big cities
* They are not big fans of snow. Chilly weather is fine, but if there's a high likelihood of snow, we'll probably avoid that. I know this limits us to mostly the South
* Small drives (2-3 hours) is ok, but we wouldn't want our trip to be very drive focussed (think: Pacific Coast highway). The toddler doesn't do well in cars
* We prefer to keep it domestic

Budget is quite relaxed but obviously don't want to go crazy, what I priced up in this post came to about $2500 for flights and accommodation.

* New York: A no brainer really, there's everything to do here, plus it’s where most of the cheapest UK flights land. I’ll spend 5 nights here.
* New Orleans: Always been on my list, I'm not totally sure why, possibly the mix of good food, music, and unique colonial architecture / culture. It's somewhere I've always wanted to go, maybe just for that Gumbo. Another 5 nights.
* Puerto Rico: For winter sun and the Spanish-American cultural blend, the rest of the trip will be quite active, so this feels like a nice way to relax before heading home; 5 nights here to finish.

Here’s where I could use some help: I’d like to visit a smaller, less touristy (for Brits anyway) city for 2 nights between New York and New Orleans. Initially, I thought of something down the East Coast, but then I came across Portland, Maine. As a bearded man in his thirties, the cliché rings true and I'm big into craft beer, and as a big NEIPA drinker, going to New England really appeals to me. I hear Portland has 27 breweries in the city, and will also have that smaller city vibe, so I think I'd really enjoy it there. However, it’s a bit tricky to reach and expensive for just two nights. So the question, Is it worth it, or would you suggest elsewhere?

About me: I’m an extroverted introverted, so really enjoy meeting locals and fellow travellers alike when my social battery allows it, so I’ll look for social accommodations and group activities like walking tours or pub crawls when in the bigger cities, are these a thing in NYC/NO? I live for good coffee, good food and good beer, and seek them out everywhere I go, I'm expecting to be very happy in America in this regard. I'm also a metalhead, and have always been curious about the American metalcore scene, would love to find some bars along the way that align with that, maybe thats more likely in NYC? Oh, and I’d love to see an NHL game whilst here! I see Rangers vs. Blue Jackets is on when I'm planning to be in town, anyone know how hard it is to get a ticket for this?

Thanks for reading this far, none of this is set in stone, so any recommendations, critiques, or advice would be hugely appreciated! Oh, and finally, how welcoming is the US for British solo travellers, and am I going to have fun?",1728417735.0,2024-10-08 19:56:05
t3_1fz7ieu,Patagonia super post Part 1 – itinerary + reviews from Bariloche and la ruta de los 7 lagos,"Hi all,

I spent a month in Patagonia during Argentina's summer, and I would like to share some thoughts, both to record my own feelings but also to potentially help others trip planning. My ideal travel style is to take my sweet time in new places, in life, to get to know them better than I would just breezing through, and I was able to set up my world this year to be able to travel in this way. If you're similar, you might get something out of what's written below.

Part 1 is on the area around Bariloche. Part 2 (or more?) will address El Bolsón, El Chaltén, and El Calafate.

In general, there's lots of blog posts I read about the smallest amount of time you can ""do,"" say, the route of the 7 lakes in, but if you are bumming around the country for a while, give yourself as much time as possible. For me, one month in Patagonia was not enough. I left some crumbs on the floor (which is totally ok, anti-conquistador mentality, just felt a bit harried/frustrated at the time...I suppose I will just have to go back some day :) more on what I would go back for later). Also remember to budget in days to do laundry, run errands, walk around town, do souvenir shopping, rain check activities, etc. I did not, because I am stupid/a robot/not in love with the practical side of life and tend to forget about my body and how I have to take care of it! Don't be me! Once you've budgeted an approximate amount of days for the things you'd like to do in any one place, I'd suggest adding more to that if you can.

Below is my initial itinerary, annotated to reflect how it changed as well as how I would change it further in ways I was unable to (because of tickets bought in advance to save money, etc.) to make it more relaxing, fun, and thorough. Used AllTrails extensively and Wikiloc sometimes to stay on track.

# Bariloche

**Day 1** – **arrive in Bariloche, buy snacks/food, settle**

**Day 2** – **Cerro Bella Vista + Goye** **✨**  
*chill warmup hike, nice views, though Cerro Goye maybe not as interesting after Cerro Bella Vista (plus infested with tábanos on the sunny day I was lucky to go). I went up from Colonia Suiza to Cerro Bella Vista first, then Cerro Goye, then backtracked and went down the same route I came up, making it out-and-back rather than a loop to keep it chill. The descent from Goye I didn't do is supposed to be a little more intense, and while I can manage intense I didn't want that for my first day. Note via bus you can only take 13B/10B around 8:30am or 13A every hour starting from 9:30am, so make sure to be where you gotta be at those times if you want an early start.*

**Day 3** – recovery day with **Sendero Los Arrayanes &gt; Lago Escondido &gt; Villa Tacul** **✨**or ~~Playa Muñoz~~  
*chose over Playa Muñoz because was a colder, windier day, though Play Muñoz might have been more sheltered from the wind. Usually not very into these popular, flat hikes, but this was pretty cool. You get to see some arrayanes, more than a few nice places to swim (I got in a couple of times despite the wind, particularly at Mirador Lago Moreno, where the rocky entry point was just too enticing, and the playa to the east of Playa Villa Tracul, because it was sheltered from the wind and hotter), plus the dope view from Cerro Llao Llao of Cerro López. Recommend.*

**Day 4** – ~~Bahía López &gt; Pico Turista &gt; Cerro Bailey Willis &gt; Refugio Laguna Negra~~ **Sendero Laguna Negra from Colonia Suiza to Refugio Laguna Negra**, with a side trip after dropping off stuff to **Cerro Bailey Willis ✨**  
*after seeing an imposing Cerro López the day before on my hike and consulting with my airbnb host, who has lived in the area for over 20 years, I changed my initial plans. Apparently, and as I later found out, the* *Bahía López to Cerro López via Sendero Palotinos* *is pretty heavy, and I would not recommend with a large backpack! Most people doing this back around the way route to Laguna Negra go up Camino al Refugio López, maybe spend a night there or camping nearby first, and then go through Pico Turista and Cerro Bailey Willis on way to spending a night at Refugio Laguna Negra, so I might suggest that (adds a night/day), though the rocky ridge atop Cerro Bailey Willis was not super chill either. Therefore, unless you're experienced I again would not suggest doing with a heavy backpack. The direct trail to Laguna Negra from Colonia Suiza was also LOVELY, btw, so I am glad I did it in the end. The extra 3 hours out-and-back to Cerro Bailey Willis sans backpack was also grrreat. Alone on the peak I had an up close encounter with my first juvenile condor...a highlight. The refugio is one of the older ones and smaller, but the food was good and I liked the intimate atmosphere.*

**Day 5** – ~~go back ""short way"" via Camino al Refugio López. More grocery shopping +/or swimming~~ headed down again via **Sendero Laguna Negra**  
*add a day for booking transport to Pampa Linda and running some errands to spend less money over there. Maybe could also do Playa Muñoz or Playa del Moreno sin viento/Playa del viento if you get that shit done in the morning of the extra day (or even add a second day to chill at one of those beaches).*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days\~\~\~\~\~

**Day 6** – **Pampa Linda** in morning, then **\[Saltillo Las Nalcas✨\], Ventisquero Negro, Mirador de la Garganta del Diablo**, ~~and maybe Mirador Este Glaciar Castaño Overa +/or Cerro Volcánico Este if have time~~  
*walked to Saltillo Las Nalcas from the albergue, then hitchhiked to Ventisquero Negro (the way there is a road for vehicles anyway, not really a trail, and hot and sunny and infested with tábanos), walked to Garganta del Diablo (again, road, but at least more shaded), and hitchhiked back to the albergue. My fave was Saltillo Las Nalcas, where I got in under the fall and then also later that evening went swimming in the glacial creeks with a great view of Cerro Tronador in the background. Ventisquero Negro and Garganta del Diablo were more touristy/groomed, though I guess worth it, kind of why not, if you're in the area. I do wish I had another day or two so I could do the* [*Mirador Este Glaciar Castaño Overa*](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/argentina/rio-negro/miradores-glaciar-castano-overo-y-ventisquero-negro?u=i&amp;sh=scsmqc) *and* [*Cerro Volcánico Este*](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/argentina/rio-negro/cerro-volcanico-este?u=i&amp;sh=scsmqc)*, and I also really liked the albergue, so worth staying in a couple more days to do that if you can.*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days\~\~\~\~\~

**Day 7** – **Refugio Otto Meiling + \[Sendero Glaciar Castaño Overa✨\]**  
*did as an out-and-back day hike. At the time, the nearly 18miles and not sure how much elevation gain was a lot for me, though later on in the trip I hiked 24mi, so w/e idk. The short add-on to the lower mirador was worth it, really beautiful (light for photos is better early in the day FYI, but I went on the way back in the afternoon and it was still stunning, just backlit), and there are some views at the top that are dope, plus saw lots of condors up there, but the trail itself most of the way is made more for horses, wide, dusty, flat, uninteresting and duh full of tábanos. I'm glad I did it, but I don't really know if it's necessary to go all the way to the refugio unless you're staying there. I grabbed lunch and rested for a bit, so that was chill, but it's not, like, the best hike I've done in my life. Maybe just go to the point where you can see the waterfalls coming off the glacier and the huge valley up top? Bring lunch? Up in the air in terms of recommending it or not. Not sure I would even recommend splitting it up into two days and spending the night at the refugio (though the entire staff was made up of women, which is v cool). Jury's out. (Also, FYI, met some people at the hostel in Pampa Linda who walked over the glacier, doing a Pampa Linda &gt; Ilón &gt; Rocca &gt; Meiling &gt; Pampa Linda loop, and they said I was smart to skip this option, but if it's something that appeals, go for it)*

**Day 8** – **Refugio Ilón from Pampa Linda + \[Cerro Capitan✨\]**  
*first day of 3 day point to point hike to Lago Frías. Trail to the refugio is kind of par for the course for the area, though it did seem like there were slightly fewer horseflies, and it was less groomed than other paths (always a bonus in my books). Refugio itself was really nice – liked the buildings and the lake that it's on. I went in the water a little too late in the day for it to be warm but can definitely see dipping in around midday being appealing. Dropped my stuff in the hut after checking in and high-tailed it up to Cerro Capitán. I was only interested in this at first because I was upset (due to financial limitations/my desire to not hire a guide and instead do everything myself that I could) that I wasn't going to get to do La Travesía de las 5 Lagunas. Someone who reviewed that hike had mentioned Laguna Jujuy being their favourite lake on the hike, so I thought that if I couldn't do the whole thing at least I could check out Jujuy from Ilón. Really glad I did! Instead of abajando-ing down to the lake and subiendo-ing back up, I just hung out on/explored the top. There's a great view of Tronador as well as Volcán Osorno all the way in Chile (if you're there on a clear day like I was), plus what you look at from Mirador del Doctor, and more from up there. But the way up/down is nothing to sneeze at either. Beautiful alpine flowers next to flowing streams, lots of different birds including bandurrias/black-faced ibis, which have a pretty wild birdcall, not to mention the fact I was entirely alone. So good.*

**Day 9 – Refugio Ilón to Refugio Rocca, including Mirador Del Doctor**  
*this was described as rough in lots of reviews/guides, and they were accurate. In that, with my full backpack, I was definitely tired and sore by the end. Only 11mi and 3000ft elevation gain, but all the up-and-down and terrain had me reeling. Was occasionally difficult to find the trail, even with markings from the park service, though I guess I prefer that to wide open paths. The mirador was nice, but you likely will not be alone, and I was more blown away by Cerro Capitán the afternoon before, though I would not skip the mirador if you're already all the way out there doing this trail – it's not too long/tough of an addition (I left my pack at the fork). Saw a Magellanic woodpecker and some other cool birdies in there,  met some cool people along the way, and there were a few spots to blast my exhausted footsies with cold mountain water, but was v happy to arrive at Rocca. Which is more built-out and busier and expensive than the other refugios I stayed at. If you're just gonna stay at one refugio this would not be my personal choice, but it did have creature comforts like showers so if that's your jam, go for it. Also absolutely necessary resting point on this 3 day trek.*

**Day 10 – Refugio Rocca to Lago Frías (part of Paso de las Nubes), Turisur ferry from Lago Frías to Puerto Pañuelo**  
*looking at the elevations, I thought this hike was gonna be easy peasy: mostly downhill, then a long flat section. DON'T BE ME! Leave as close to 8 or 8:30 as you can, because it's more time-intensive than it seems. Then it will be fun instead of stressful (will I make the boat? Won't I?), as there's more clambering than in other areas, different vegetation, different bugs, and lots of lovely streams to dip your toes in/some waterfalls. Booked the ferry in advance at the Turisur office in Bariloche, which I think is easiest – their website confused the shit out of me. After arriving back in Bariloche, I picked up a rental car I got for 4 days to do La Ruta de Los 7 Lagos and checked into my airbnb.*

**Day 11 – Drive to Villa La Angostura, boat from Bahía Brava to ""Puerto Arrayanes,"" tour around the bosque, walk back to Bahía Brava via Sendero Bosque de Arrayanes, including Miradores Bahía Mansa and Brazo Norte** ~~(on the way to Los Arrayanes National Park or after: Sendero Río Bonito, Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana, other beaches)~~  
*so prior to this point you can see that I've made recommendations for adjustments of 1-2 days, but this is where my time estimates really started to fail me. There is so, so much to see and do along the ruta, 4 days is really not enough if you're pretty sure you're NOT going to be making your way back to Patagonia any time soon. While I absolutely knew I would not be able to see everything of interest on this drive, and many spots on my list were definitely more suggestions/possibilities than hard plans/have-to-dos, I missed out on more than I would have liked to*. *For instance, just driving to Villa La Angostura, I saw tons of unmarked places with cars parked along the side of the road, where I would have stopped to investigate :p and swim if I'd left more time. Also the car rental company did not allow me to take my car to Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana because ""they're in Chile,"" despite the fact that the falls are actually not technically across the border in Chile, just past a border checkpoint. Such a bummer. But maybe if I'd had more time I could have found other adventurers, possibly Argentinos, or some kind of tour situation (eyeroll) with the ability to take transpo over there. So I would say something like:*  
\~\~\~1st day: drive leisurely to Villa La Angostura and check out swim spots along the way. If you have time in the afternoon (you should!) I'd do Sendero Río Bonito and chill on the beach it lets out onto (Playa La Escondida/Playa Río Bonito/Playa Publica) slash the other beaches nearby (Playa de las Aguas Calientes, Puerto Manzano)  
\~\~\~2nd day: Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana, and Playas on the way back (Playa La Aguada del Burro, Playa Escondida, Playa Lago Espejo)  
\~\~\~3rd day: Bosque de Arrayanes in the morning. Chill at Playa Lago Correntoso in the afternoon  
\~\~\~\~\~+2 days\~\~\~\~\~  
*As far as what I did get up to on my Day 11, I took the 3:45 ferry from Bahía Brava to the bosque. The schedule for boats from Bahía Brava (which take you along the outside of the peninsula) was slightly different than what I saw online (I thought the afternoon boat left at 3:15), but you should be able to find something to your liking from them or Bahía Mansa, and just swim at the beach while waiting. Also swam at the muelle/beach where the boat arrived, even though there are signs saying you're kinda not supposed to. But the sun was going down and I had to take my chances :). Tour was fine. Might have enjoyed the walk back along the peninsula more if I wasn't chasing the sunlight/sunset. Would say the first quarter leaving from the forest, where you can see more arrayanes outside of the boardwalked route, and the last quarter, where you can see more of the water, are the best. But the middle section is kind of basic, dusty, and flat, and I was a bit bored/tired. Head to Mirador Brazo Norte for the sunset (if you're there around that time), and Mirador Bahia Mansa any other time (pretty view of the water and boats, reminded me of Croatia)*

**Day 12 –** ~~Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana,~~ **✨Playa La Escondida/the beach by Río Bonito, Playa Lago Correntoso, \[Playa la Aguada del Burro\], Playita de Lago Espejo Chico,** ~~Sendero Cascada Ñivinco, Cascada Vuliñanco~~, **and creeks on the side of the road** on the way from **Villa La Angostura &gt; San Martín de Los Andes**  
*There was lots I enjoyed here, and I had a a decent amount of time at all of the stops listed, but it might be worth it to break it up further (following something like the suggested itinerary above, where you'd have visited Río Bonito, Playa la Aguada del Burro, Playa Lago Espejo, and Playa Lago Correntoso by this point already) so you could add (Lago Espejo Chico proper? didn't make it to the lake proper so can't say anything about it) Sendero Cascada Ñivinco at a reasonable hour (before 4 is much better – heat of the sun was gone when I got there on Day 13), and Cascada Vuliñanco (which I only ever saw from the road, didn't do the hike to it) today. As far as what I did do, LOVED Playa Río Bonito (cut out the walk to it because of all I wanted to try to squeeze in the day, but looked really cool and liked the small part of it closer to the beach I did, walking variably in the cool water and on the trail), Playa Lago Correntoso (water is so, so clear. Parking was a bit of a bitch but once I found it I stayed for hours because I was just in love. Plus there are places to jump/dive/drift at Río Correntoso), and Playita de Lago Espejo Chico (more like a creek situation. Flowing water to float down, and a tree to jump off of. Fun times). Playa la Aguada del Burro was less busy, which is always a plus, but given what I got used to on this day, was less impressive (water's murkier, etc.), and could definitely skip. There's also a beautiful river on the side of 40 (Río Pichi Traful?) I hopped into at some random place along the road and loved.*

**Day 13 – \[Playa de Yuco✨\],** ~~La Islita, Muelle Hua Hum, Pucará, Playa Quila Quina, and/or Pya Catritre on Lago Lácar,~~ **Playa Lago Hermoso,** ~~Cascadas del Rio Hermoso,~~ **dip in Lago Faulkner,** ~~Lago Escondido,~~ **\[Sendero Cascada Ñivinco✨\],** ~~y Playa de Lago Traful~~ on the way from **San Martín de los Andes &gt; Villa Traful**  
*As you can see, there was a bunch I missed out on closer to San Martín de los Andes (including a river area called Pozones de Caleufú about an hour from the town I didn't even bother trying to wedge into what I could see was becoming an uncomfortably tight schedule), which is also, from what I heard from most of the Argentinians I met, THE town preferred over Bariloche for hanging out in the north of Patagonia. I barely got to spend any time at all in town. So I would do something like*  
\~\~\~1st full day SMdlA: Pozones de Caleufú in morning/midday, hike La Islita in the later afternoon and stay for sunset  
\~\~\~2nd full day SMdlA: Playa de Yuco, then quick stop at Muelle Hua Hum on the way to Pucará  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-3 days (3rd day for errands, and/or other beaches)\~\~\~\~\~  
*in which case, on this, the day you leave SMdlA you could do Playa Quila Quina +/or Pya Catritre on the way out of town instead of drive all the way to Playa de Yuco and all the way back like I did, leaving more time for other stuff throughout the day. That being said, Playa de Yuco is a recommend. There are like 5 lil different beach areas to chill at. The more ""rugged"" Playas 4 and 5 had fewer people, but there were great swimming and jumping/diving spots all around. Playa Lago Hermoso seemed nice, but there was a strong wind coming from the west by the time I got there, so it was harder to enjoy. I stubbornly camped out there nonetheless, only to regret it later when getting to the Cascadas Ñivinco with no direct sun or when rolling into Villa Traful past sundown with nowhere to stay. If your day is similar go elsewhere – perhaps, for instance, the Cascadas del Rio Hermoso would have been a bit more protected from the wind by trees? The beach at Lago Faulkner is sandy but is right by route 40 (aka not as nice) and was still chilly despite facing east, so I just hopped in for a quick dip. Could easily skip to get to Cascadas Ñivinco sooner to spend more time there. It was still busy when I get there around 4, even though most of the foot traffic was heading out back to their cars, so hard to say if it would be pleasant during peak hours, but in my imagination it would be magnificent in full sun (since I still enjoyed it, even in the shade), and I would give it a shot for sure.*

**Day 14 –** ~~Valle Encantado on way from~~ **Villa Traful &gt; Bariloche** via 65/237, ✨**Cerro López (Bahía López route)** in the afternoon  
*First things first, I would add a full day in Villa Traful, obvio (and perhaps try to get to Villa Traful before sunset :D). Then you can maybe check out el bosque sumergido, the main town, and the alfajores at Del Montañés. I had initially planned on doing these things today, but got it into my harebrain I had to try to do the tough route up to Pico Turista before leaving Bariloche. Having already booked my bus out (dumbass) to El Bolsón for Day 15, and having no other feasible time in which I could attempt it given my overscheduling the rest of the trip, I tried to high-tail it back to Bariloche early in the morning on Day 14 to start up to Cerro López at a ""reasonable"" hour. I therefore also missed the hike (slash swimming?) at Valle Encantado. Actually, the best way to fix all this would be to add a full day for Cerro López earlier on, in which case you could perhaps do these things in and around Villa Traful ""today"" (aka the day you wake up in and leave Villa Traful), still possibly getting the car back to Bariloche at the end of the day, or driving back to Bariloche and doing Valle Encantado the next morning.*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days (1 for Cerro López earlier in the trip, and possibly a full day in Villa Traful)\~\~\~\~\~  
*As it was I made it to the trailhead at Bahía López around 12:30, which was too late really (for me, not for all people) to start, but I forced it. Because I was doing this more dangerous, unfrequented route alone (not advisable), I was going quite slow and cautiously. By the time I made it to the ridgeline/turnoff between Sendero Palotinos/Pico Turista and the below ridge ""route"" (used loosely), at the rate I was going (quite slow, like 1mph on the harder upward incline sections), I knew if I tried to go to Pico Turista via the ridge I wouldn't be able to get my car back to the rental place by 8pm, and maybe wouldn't even make it to a safer portion of the hike before sundown. So I cut across the N/E face of the mountain :(((. This isn't used that much either, apparently, so there were some dicey waterfall/snow crossings and lots of areas where the trail was not clear at all. I had my offline AllTrails map but that did not mean that the GPS route coincided with anything in reality. I still recommend this if you have experience bouldering/climbing/hiking for real for real, just go earlier so you can go at a safe pace and do the ridgeline to Pico Turista well before sunset (and, you know, go with an equally experienced friend). If you don't have experience with hardcore hikes, don't know how to step/aren't sure in your steps, DO NOT ATTEMPT. But I saw many condors, beautiful views, and had a fun time figuring out my way up the mountain.*

\~\~\~\~\~+1 day in Bariloche for a mani/pedi, souvenir shopping, laundry, etc.?\~\~\~\~\~

**BARILOCHE AREA SUMMARY**  
Did lots of amazing shit in 14 days, but I would recommend adding anywhere from 6-12, maybe even more days both to make it a bit more leisurely AND to get more sights/experiences in. Many of these added days would be during la Ruta de los 7 Lagos, which would mean a car for more days than I could afford (there were definitely people doing this by bus/hitchhiking, but I didn't research this so cannot advise), but if you budget better for that ahead of time and/or find friends/just have fam round to split that expense with you, it could work out.

See you next time in El Bolsón, El Chaltén, and El Calafate! (It took me a long time to write Part 1 so it might take a min for Part 2, but I'll get there!)",1728413674.0,2024-10-08 19:56:05

Whenever I’ve flown short haul with BA all we’ve ever gotten was a bottle of water and a chocolate biscuit bar. 

My only other comparison for long haul was Emirates (over 5 years ago) so I thought it was just the standard these days but clearly other flag carriers are able to offer better.

I am planning a trip to Belize / Guatemala / El Salvador in December / January and I know what im doing in Belize and partly Guatemala, so this post is only related to Guatemala. Having come from Belize i start the trip in Flores.

This feedback I ask for is primarily related to route, locations and duration each place. Like for instance, should I go straight to Xela on day 9 after Acetenango hike? Or should I stay one more day in Lanquin / Semuc Champey and remove one night in Flores? These are the thoughts I have that I would appreciate your feedback on. Ideally I would like to be flexiable and not book everything in advance, but this is high season and over the holidays, so I think stuff will sell out.

Route as I have planned it now look like this. Appreciate your feedback

A vet in Funchal issued him a Portuguese pet passport. We've been back in the States since April, and I'm starting to plan a return to the islands for late this year.

Question is whether I need a new USDA certificate for the cat to bring him back to Portugal. I recently got him his vaccine updates, and the vet annotated them in the pet passport. The USDA certificate costs several hundred dollars, and I'd like to avoid it if the Portuguese pet passport makes it unnecessary. Thanks!",1728422169.0,2024-10-08 19:56:05

I’m planning a trip to Italy but need help figuring out which cities are must-visits. I plan to stay in Florence for 2 nights, but I’m unsure about the rest of my itinerary. I generally prefer not to stay more than 2 nights in any city.

I’m having some trouble finding an affordable flight or bus from Edinburgh to Florence, so I may need to stop over somewhere in Italy. Since Florence is in the northern part of the country, it makes sense to focus on that area, but I’m unsure which cities to prioritize and the best route to take.

t3_1fz3uqk,Iberia nightmare for name correction,"Ok guys, I'm having a nightmare with Iberia.

I made the mistake of registering for Iberia Plus using only my middle name. Now, whenever I try to book tickets, Iberia auto-fills my name, and I can't issue tickets with my LAST name (I've even had to cancel tickets because of this). To make matters worse, their website doesn't allow me to update my name myself.

I reached out to Iberia, and they directed me to fill out a form on [contacto.iberia.com](http://contacto.iberia.com), requesting the name correction and providing a copy of my passport. I've followed these steps, but each time I get an automated response telling me I can change my address or, if the issue persists, to submit the same form again—which I’ve already done three times.

I’m at a loss for what to do next. I even considered registering as a “frequent companion” using my full name to bypass this and issuing a ticket that way. I can't delete my current account and start fresh because I have a lot of Avios points that I’d lose. Has anyone experienced something similar? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

When arriving at EZE airport, is it still fine/best to use Uber (with credit card) to get into town? I arrive late and understood it's not really advisable to change money at the airport (I don't have any USD bills).

I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience. I am a Ukrainian citizen with a residence permit in the EU.

Recently, while traveling, I accidentally spilled water on my biometric passport. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be heavily affected; the appearance and 99% of the stamps look just like before.

However, I’m concerned about the biometric NFC chip embedded in the passport’s cover. I wasn’t even aware of its existence before. Now that I’ve read about it, I found an app called ReadID and tried to scan the chip — but it’s not being detected :(

For instance, my friend’s passport scans without any issues.

My question is: how critical is this problem? Could it affect border crossings, opening bank accounts, or any other procedures where the passport is required? Does this make the passport invalid? Or is there a chance that official institutions have different devices that might be able to read the chip, even if my phone can’t?

Thank you very much in advance for your reply.

t3_1fyusxc,Unsure if Visa requirements entering China for a layover ,"Hello everyone, could someone please explain the entry requirements for China. In January I’ll be travelling to Australia with my Portuguese partner and whilst we have her visa figured out it’s mine (British citizen) that’s a bit confusing.

I’ve read that if you are only transitioning through the country through a selected airport (which ours is on the list) you don’t need to apply for a visa, you only need to apply for a 24hour permit which allows you to stay only in the airport and you have to prove you have a connecting flight. Our layover will be 9 hours. 

Would I still need to pay for a visa or would I apply for one of those permits before departing the UK or prior to landing in china?

This might not be the right place to ask but if anyone could shed some light on this I’d be great.

t3_1fyfmr8,Trying to round out my Taiwan itinerary,"Hi all,

I've got a trip coming up to Taiwan at the end of this month for about 8 days. We'll be starting out in Taipei and planning to do a lot of the common activities and day trips from there (Yangmingshan, Beitou, biking around the city, night markets, Elephant and/or Teapot mountain hikes). 

We want to see another part of the country as well and have landed on Tainan. Currently we're booked for 3 nights there (arrive afternoon day 1, two full days, leave early back to Taipei on day 3). 

I've read that Tainan is all about history and food, and personally I'm not too much into the history when I travel. I'm not disinterested, but I'm not the type of person to prioritize museums or temples just for the educational aspect. I'm more intersted in nature/scenery, food, walking/biking around, local culture. It's very hard to tell if two full days in Tainan is going to be overkill for this and if we should prioritize Taipei time. 

Also we were considering the east coast but spending 5 hours to and from Taitung seemed like a lot of time after the rest of our travel (we'll be in Singapore coming from US first, so a lot of time on planes and traveling). Though biking around that area seems really nice. 

Just trying to find a good way to round out our trip and a bit worried Tainan might be a miss. It seems very polarizing in that many people recommend but then many people say it's boring. For someone like me that wouldn't normally prioritize museums/historical education, is there still enough to fill 2 days that wouldn't be better spent elsewhere?

t3_1fy2dpd,The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

BOA airlines sucks and is very corrupt (not surprising to anyone who knows Bolivia well). With Bolivia's recent currency volatility, things have gotten a lot worse. Not a lot of options around Bolivia, unfortunately. 

  
**IF FLYING BOA:** 

1. Do not let the airline put priority tags on your luggage (if you are paying for an upgraded seat). All this will do is make your bag a target to be stolen / ransacked when checked 

2. Keep everything valuable with you... Particularly cash (should be obvious but i'll state the obvious)

3. If you are checking a bag, don't lock your luggage. Airline workers will just cut the locks off and ruin your suitcase. Might as well let them search through your things without breaking your suitcase so you don't have to spend a few hundred replacing the luggage they ripped into. BOA will not take any accountability for their employees breaking into your luggage and stealing your belongings.

Sichuan, Tibet, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhangjiajie have huge draws.

t3_1fyilk0,Self Transfer at Abu Dhabi Airport (both flights Etihad) with 2 different PNR,"Hello,

I am an Indian travelling from Bengaluru to Athens with a layover at Abu Dhabi airport. Both my flights are Etihad but have a different PNR number. The terminal for both flights is also same. This is essentially a self transfer connection. The time interval for layover between both flights at Abu Dhabi airport is 2hrs 15mins.

1. Will I need a transit visa for this?
2. Is there a transit counter where I can go to, to get my boarding pass and Etihad transfers my luggage automatically to the next flight?
3. Will I have to exit the airport and re-check-in, passing through immigration?

I've already set off on my trip and completely forgot to get travel insurance. The few companies that are willing to insure for a trip already in progress now want to charge a premium. 

The thing is, my trip is made up of smaller stays in various parts of Thailand. So can't I just consider one of my visits (Krabi, Thailand) as one trip that hasn't started yet, and just get fresh future travel insurance for that (even though I've already started the larger part of the trip in Thailand).

I’m looking for an easy family resort with meals and activities included so it’s very low planning for me. But something fun for the teenagers too. 

Whenever I ask about all inclusive resorts, most people think of going to an island.  I’m looking for something easy and drivable from the Philly area -  Catskills, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia, etc. We do go to Woodloch Pines in the Poconos every year, just looking to mix it up with something different. 

I also want to make sure the teenagers are occupied. A lot of family resorts are geared towards little kids so I want to make sure there is enough for teenagers to do. My husband and I are easy, we just want to relax. I want to avoid getting on a plane (I travel a lot for work) and not worry about anything. 

Would love any and all suggestions.

t3_1fyghkm,Which places in South-East Asia is enjoyable in January?,"Me and my boyfriend are planning on taking a vacation in January to somewhere warm, and would love some advice/ insight/ suggestions! We live in Scandinavia so the days in winter are long, dark and cold, especially January. We´re both prone to winter depression, so now that we have the opportunity for a vacation in January, we´re planning on taking it. Indonesia has been an option we have been considering, and we wouldmlove to go there, but it seems as though the rain season is at it´s peak in January in parts of Indonesia. Though the rain itself doesn´t bother us that much, the high humidity does.

For context we would love to stay somewhere that´s not super mainstream or full of resorts. If we find a nice area, we´ll look into the opportunity of renting a nice little place for a couple weeks, somewhere by the coast, somewhere quiet. Preferably not around the biggest cities, but located near a village or something along those lines. We love good food but our budget doesn´t allow us fine dining, but that´s not a problem, somewhere with good local food is more than enough! We would love to stay somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture! We also love to surf and swim (we´re both beginners at surfing though) , but having that oppurtunity is also a big part of the vacation.

To summarize; we would love advice / suggestions on somewhere to go on vacation in south-east Asia that´s not to touristic and not too overflooded with rain and high humidity in January. Preferably somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture, where it´s possible to surf. Any suggestions or general advice is very appreciated! Thank you!!

There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").

t3_1fyfn9k,South America 6 weeks travel itinerary,"Hello Reddit travelers!

We are a couple from Sweden, 30 and 27 years old, planning a 6-week trip through South America starting in January 2024. We’ve already booked our arrival and departure flights, landing in Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd of January and flying home from San José, Costa Rica, on the 18th of February. We love  to explore both cities and nature, but prefer to keep things fairly comfortable, avoiding long hikes and multi-day camping trips. We’ll mostly be flying between countries to save time and exploring various destinations without overloading our schedule. We're looking to stay in private rooms at hostels to stay on budget, but might consider hotels for a few nights in total if they're worth the extra buck. 

We have a route in mind and would love any feedback, especially tips on the must-sees, hidden gems, and general advice on logistics!
 

**--- January 3–13 (10 days) – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

We’re thinking about staying in the Ipanema area, close to Copacabana.
Planning to explore iconic spots like Sugarloaf Mountain, Selarón Steps, Parque Lage, and the beaches of course.
We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe).
Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out.
For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.   


 We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in?
We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?  


 **--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.**

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants.
Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.


**--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco)  – Fly to Cusco, Peru.**

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?  

  
**--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).**

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing?
Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.


**--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.**

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.


**--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.**

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example.
We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? 
We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?


**--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.**

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic.
Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

It's not supposed to hit Miami as of right now but that could change. Also Friday is like 2 days after the estimated landfall that's going to be on Wednesday and it should've dissipated by then but I don't know how much.

What worries me is that if the area surrounding the airport floods then they're probably going to close that airport. 

It's very important that I get to Chicago on Friday so I can't move the trip to next week. 

It's going to be me and my wife but we're in separate reservations. Hers is paid with cash and has a strict cancellation policy and mine was with miles and has a flexible cancelation policy. 

I have the option of flying through Houston instead, which will give me a little peace of mind but we would be forfeiting her ticket and losing that money. The thing is that I should make the decision today, bc the price is still kinda reasonable. 

So my options would be, waiting it out and leaving everything as is, but risk my trip getting upended by the hurricane, or losing my wife's ticket money and just changing my ticket and buying a new one for her (but risking that Miami would be unscathed and I spent all that money for nothing)

t3_1fymwit,"I want to visit Turks and Caicos, but I don't have a driver's license","Hi everyone!

After five intense years of working Mondays to Sundays building my (successful!) business and taking 0 vacation, I’m craving some well-deserved rest on a beautiful beach, soaking in the sun and gazing at the turquoise ocean.

I’m considering a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands and looking to book either an Airbnb or, more likely, a hotel there. While I will mostly rest, I want to explore the island, visit snorkeling spots, restaurants, bars, and different beaches. My concern is: I don't drive. I don't have a license. I read everywhere than renting a car is essential to move around.

So I'm wondering: Can I simply rely on the cabs? I understand it can be an expensive option, but I’m willing to spend some money. Do cabs go everywhere? Is there a hotel that’s closer to the main attractions?

Thank you so much for your help.

t3_1fy7h65,Travel suggestions for Nov and Dec on east coast,"Hi everyone,

My family is visiting from overseas in mid-November and will stay until Jan beginning. They live in a tropical country, so they've never experienced fall colors or snowy winters before. I live on the East Coast, and I'd love for them to experience as many things as possible. I'm planning weekend trips mostly so they can rest during the week (I have work, and my parents are in their 60s, so I don't want to overwhelm them).

Here's what I have in mind:

1. **Fall foliage:** Do any states still have fall foliage left by the 3rd week of November? I was thinking of taking them to DC, but I’m open to suggestions.
2. **Niagara Falls:** Is it worth visiting during late November/Thanksgiving weekend? How is the experience around that time?
3. **New York City:** Planning an overnight stay around Christmas/New Year and going to see the Statue of Liberty the next day. Which one would be better
4. 3-4 days trip to California to get them some sun and just relax on the beach.

If anyone has other recommendations, I’d love to hear them. I'm looking for ideas that would be easy on them  but still let them enjoy the best of what this season has to offer.

t3_1fya1r4,Hertz is trying to charge me for damage to the car pls give me advice ,"We returned the car with no damages and the agent that checked our car verbally stated that there were no damages. The gas lid that is on the outside of the car with the paint fell off on the first refueling of the car when I tried to open it by pushing and it just came off with my hand. It was completely undamaged at return and the agent said it was no problem and he tried to reattach it himself but there was a crunch sound and he snapped something. He then said that he would have to send it to the shop so they can re attach it and reassured me that there would be no charges whatsoever. Once again if you note the areas of damage in the report there is nothing that says damage just assessment to the gas lid which in the picture is right next to it. If the gas lid was damaged it was done by the agent. 

I never received an email about the damages and deleted any pictures and videos I had about the car to save storage on my phone. I only received a letter which I didn’t see until I returned from travels. It is wrong that I was not sent an email as soon as this was billed and only got a physical mail that I didn’t see for another month. 

there has to be security camera footage of my return date at the time that I signed the document showing that I explained it to the agent and that he himself tried to reattach it and damaged it right? He was reassuring me that no fees would be charged and no damage was done and that they just needed to reattach it.

I won't know until I get to the airport and will have to take that chance.

t3_1fy4rhm,Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

t3_1fyh24n,Flight Fares Driving Me Nuts – Is There Any Real Price Protection?,"Hey folks, I’ve been trying to book a flight from SFO to PVR and, man, these fares are all over the place. One day they’re sky-high, the next they’ve plummeted. United seems to be at the helm of this madness.

I’ve even seen next-day flights drop in price significantly, which is super frustrating because I’m torn—do I grab something “reasonable” now, only to watch it fall by $200 a week later? Should I wait? Am I just doomed to stress-refreshing flight deals?

I vaguely remember some airlines offering price protection, but I can’t recall which ones (or if that’s even still a thing). Maybe third-party sites like Orbitz offer this? Though, my last experience trying to make a claim with one of those price guarantees felt like battling customer service bosses in an endless loop of “please hold.”

So, what’s the best strategy for dealing with these wildly fluctuating fares? And is there any legit price protection out there? Would love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT:**  I just booked a fare and didn't realize that United now has this ""fare lock"" feature where you can lock the fare for - in this case - 3 days - and then opt to buy or not.  Wish I had known about this feature earlier as the prices have been fluctuating wildly by the day.  Well, thanks again, all.",1728331248.0,2024-10-08 19:56:21

t3_1fyj80o,Can KLM really trick me into giving them EUR 980,"
All my life I’ve been dreaming of going to Rio de Janeiro. I booked a flight to celebrate finishing my master’s degree. I had to work while studying to afford this trip. I booked a basic fare (EUR 980) by accident and asked customer service if I could upgrade to a student fare (for an extra EUR 110). They told me it was okay. The student fare brings several benefits such as checked-in luggage but most importantly, flexibility. You can reschedule for free and get a refund for EUR 250. So I upgraded. When upgrading I specifically asked if I could get all the benefits from the student ticket. Yes, they said, I specifically asked if I could reschedule for free and if I can reschedule for free and get a refund for the TOTAL price minus the EUR 250 cancellation fee. The lady said yes.

To keep a long story short, my last exam didn’t go as planned and I don’t really know when exactly I can go (this is out of my control). So instead of rebooking the flight for free I decided it’s worth losing the cancellation fee of EUR 250 from my total EUR 1090 and rebook by myself afterwards somewhere in mid-February to mid-March since I didn’t know exactly when I would be able to go.

The issue: I got back EUR 110 and nothing else. I explained to customer support that I was informed the opposite and they simply don’t care. Since I did the upgrade and asked about the cancellation through phone, I expect their guidance and given word to be correct. What can I do?

* Should we include Malaga too?

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip.

For the last 4 days... December 26-29.. I am contemplating flying to Salta to explore. This would give me  2-1/2 to 3 days there.. leaving out flying time. 

The tour itself will go to the parana' delta area , rocoleta cemetery area, explore one or two neighborhoods in Buenosaires and gives us about half a day that is unstructured and on our own. This doesnt seem like much time to see the city. before we the fly off to Patagonia.   

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool. In the later option I would probably lose a day due to flying.. (the flight is only 2 hours, but to get to airport and out of airport twice etc.. will shoot most of a day.

t3_1fxg6ej,Traveling with Medically Unique Toddler ,"In June 2025, we will be taking our first flight with our daughter who will be 3 years old from California to Hawaii. After years of surgeries, we are very excited to take our first trip as a family. 

However, this brings interesting challenges. 

Without getting too far into it, my daughter is fed through a feeding tube connected to her stomach. She has to be connected to her pump for 20 hours a day. I understand her pump and medications can be carried on or even checked for free due to them being medical devices. 


One other challenge is she requires special formula we can’t buy at grocery stores and will need to bring a complete supply with us. Can this be considered medical or will we have to check a bag full of formula? 

I have a CPAP machine as well, could we have one large “medical bag”? 

What’s the best way to get through TSA?


This is our first big trip in years and we are trying to be prepared as possible. 

Any advice or suggestions will be greatly welcome.",1728220335.0,2024-10-08 19:56:37

t3_1fy0s0c,Need advice on my Vietnam itinerary,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are planning a trip to Vietnam from January 30th to February 10th next year. We’ve already booked our tickets, which were a great deal, but I overlooked the fact that our trip coincides with the Tet celebrations. We’re feeling a bit anxious about how the first few days might go, so we’d love some feedback from anyone with more experience in Vietnam during this time.

Here’s our itinerary:

* **January 30:** Arrive at Hanoi airport, then take a private transfer to Tam Coc, Ninh Binh. We should arrive by 4 PM, so we’ll keep it low-key—grab a meal, walk around, and acclimatize after the flight.
* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

We’re wondering if we’ll be able to arrange private transfers during Tet and whether the weather will be warm enough to enjoy the beaches in Da Nang and Hoi An at that time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1728280543.0,2024-10-08 19:56:37

t3_1fy6p82,Krakow Travel Report,"**Arrival:**

My visit to Kraków took place on an overcast few days in early October 2024. I'd set aside three days for the city and a day trip to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. The appeal was the affordability of the trip and a curiosity to visit a Polish city and learn more about Polish culture, the WW2 history at Auschwitz-Birkenau (the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers) was also a factor in the decision to go. Many Poles choose to come to work and live in my country of residence; and I reciprocally desired to gain an understanding of their cultural background.

Alighting at the train station and walking past Barbakan (est. 1498) and through St. Florian's Gate (c. 1307) was an impressive entrance to the city. It was about 10pm at this point and as we walked down Floriańska (St. Florian's Street), I quickly noticed a number of dolled up young women standing in the middle of the street holding black umbrellas in the light rainy drizzle, looking around at bypassers. Was this prostitution or something else? Not the best first impression, but I am aware that soliciting for prostitution is legal in Poland and their laws on the matter are more lax. Sadly, in my opinion this does colour public spaces with a sleazy vibe, I think such activities should be kept out of sight especially in such a thoroughfare not far from the main square. Even at night. I did not notice any police presence monitoring these apparent activities.

**Day 1:**

Fast forward to the next day and we started by walking through part of the charming ‘Planty park’ (a circular park which encompasses the entire Old Town district), noticing an amusing overabundance of park benches. Unfortunately there were no big central parks or highly curated green areas besides this. We then hauled ourselves up a gradual slope to ascend Wawel Hill to the castle and cathedral. This is considered the most culturally important site in Poland. After having a quick stroll around the imposing Italian-style castle courtyard, we chose to enter the (nearly 1,000 year-old) cathedral via the audio-guided tour, which was not too costly. Sadly the cathedral tower was heavily scaffolded which tarnished the view. The audioguide headsets conveniently triggered different audio clips as you walk around the site, which meant you didn't have to key in numbers. Wawel Cathedral is where Polish monarchs were formerly crowned and buried. The monarchy was abolished on 25th November 1795. It's a shame that the Polish monarchy has ended as I find national interest in its own intelligentsia and ruling class to be a showcase of heroism, statecraft, and political leadership through the centuries. Although I acknowledge the valid criticism of the notion of monarchy.

From the outside, the cluster of different architectural additions over the centuries is intriguing to see, particularly the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel (1533) which was beautiful and is considered the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps, dedicated to the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty. It's worth noting that the site was getting quite busy and numerous tour groups were congregating and piling through the cathedral. Because it was a relatively small cathedral, this crowding did feel slightly uncomfortable (but still manageable) at times. There were no photos permitted inside the cathedral. 

We ascended the steep steps of the Royal Sigismund Bell tower which led to the bell at the top and a slightly restricted view over the city through a wire barrier. There was a photo op to touch the bell's clapper, which is considered good luck. Once again it was quite busy in this space owing to the crowds, luckily there was a separate descent staircase available.

We then walked down Wawel Hill into the expansive 13th century town square (Rynek Główny), the so-called ‘biggest medieval square in Europe’ according to some sources, but Charles Square in Prague is actually two times larger FYI. Our first port of call was the free to enter Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) shopping arcade in the middle of the town square, many vendor outlets sold what looked like traditional Polish goods, in particular the amber goods typical of the region and many other figurines, souvenirs, and models. 

After this we entered the grand Brick Gothic St. Mary's Basilica which sadly had a cladding of scaffolding on the main tower due to longterm repairs, meaning ascending the tower was not possible. The interior was beautiful but it was a fairly brief experience after sitting down to soak up all the churchiness. Every hour a bugle player plays a traditional five-note bugle call (hejnał) from the basilica's tallest tower. They often wave down at the crowds below. We popped into the Muzeum Farmacji (Pharmacy Museum), it is a small museum which features a good collection of pharmacy paraphernalia, but I wasn't raving about it after a few rooms full of similar jars and pots. The information and presentation of the museum appeared to have been unchanged for many years.

Walking around Wawel Hill and the town itself, images of the Polish Pope, John Paul II (1920-2005) - born Karol Józef Wojtyła - can be seen in many places, some may even say excessively! I found it quite whimsical seeing so many portraits of JP2, even despite my reservations about the Catholic Church as an institution. You can sometimes see monks walking around the town on their daily commutes.

**Day 2:**

On our second day we hopped on a guided tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. The tour was well organised although the bus itself was fairly cramped. First we stopped at Auschwitz I (Stammlager), known as former administrative and operational centre of the death-camp, and we're given headsets to hear a crystal clear transmission of the guide's voice as we were taken around the site as part of the group tour. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was the more visually striking of the two sites, with the instantly recognisable gatehouse and train tracks. The Birkenau site was even bigger than I'd imagined. The barbed wire fences and guard towers tapered off into the distance, with the site covering 6,000 football pitches of space. Both sites put together were a moving warning about humanity's darkest capabilities, with well-selected and impactful exhibits. Although I could see no central dedicated museum building. We returned to Kraków, getting back at around 7pm before then going to ‘The Black Duck’ restaurant which was very good value and enjoyable (plus points for duck theming), it was hands down the culinary highlight of the trip. Walking back to our accommodation we were solicited by a prostitute, but politely turned down the offer.

**Summary:**

I found Poland quite dour. A number of the eateries we went to nearly all played melancholic music, many of the souvenir shops stock items with an intriguing tearful girl theme, combining this melancholia with a sudden rundown post-communist greyness (and countless graffitied walls) almost immediately outside of Kraków's Old Town district, the hyped up Kazimierz area is no exception to this. Alongside the city's proximity to a major former Nazi death-camp, the experience was somewhat overshadowed by these things. Of course, Poland cannot easily separate itself from this history under Soviet &amp; Nazi occupation and before that being partitioned three times (the Austrian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition) in the late 18th century leading to 123 years of no Polish sovereignty. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed. The identity and nation of the Poles has been under threat for centuries and I think this reflects in the locals' outlook and culture, they are a guarded people fiercely interested in their national identity and faith. This is a nation in the process of regaining its pride and sense of self. The creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, was only founded in 1989, making modern Poland only 35 years old. In 2022, Poland, Greece, and Cyprus had the highest percentage of adults in the EU at risk of depression, with a share of 65 percent. This is a country with many depressed and downhearted people, but Poland is certainly moving through a period of new beginnings.

Another thing to mention is the Cracovian road zebra crossings don't often have traffic lights. So there were a number of times I felt unsafe trusting motorists to spot me and stop to allow me to safely cross the road. With that being said there isn't a lot of traffic around Kraków and locals are encouraged to use the trams.

Tourist attractions around Kraków were okay, it's very church-heavy reflecting the Catholic way of life there. At times I felt the historical museums could have told Poland's national story more narratively and engagingly. I understand there was a golden age for Poland before the partitions and then occupations during the 20th century. This golden age roughly corresponds to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572).

However, I found the Cracovian museums to be more descriptive than narrative in tone, drily listing information rather than arranging it for a modern touristic palette. Because Poland's history is more on the niche side, I'd have hoped for a more comprehensive overview/retelling. The Rynek Underground Museum (under the town square) seemed like a tourist trap displaying a banal arrangement of rocks and pillars. I decided to avoid entry. The same can be said of the former town hall tower, the view is said to be extremely limited.

To justify a trip to Kraków I recommend spending about two days there max. You will enjoy great value for money on food and drink but the tourist sites are nothing out of this world. You should ideally combine the town with a day trip to either the salt mine or Auschwitz-Birkenau, or perhaps to the mountains nearby if you are outdoorsy (the Tatra Mountains and Zakopane, a popular resort town in the foothills of the mountains). I recommend taking in the town slowly, it shouldn't be rushed as you may quickly run out of things to do if you are not careful.

I give Kraków an overall 5.5/10.

**Souvenirs:**

I struggled to find many souvenirs/keepsakes that really caught my eye. I would recommend having a look in the Kraków Cloth Hall and the outlets on the outside of the building, although I felt much of the items for sale were almost identical between the stalls, the variety on offer was unfortunately lacking. 
I recommend checking out Niebieska Kropka Boleslawiec Pottery and the ""Kacper Ryx"" Historical Shop. I purchased a handmade fridge magnet from the latter which was fairly pricey, but had rustic appeal. I also stumbled across the Wawel Castle Souvenir shop (to the left of the courtyard entrance as you enter) and it turned out to be one of the better souvenir shops in Kraków. So do check that out.

**Food:**

None of my travel review should be considered exhaustive, but I highly recommend going to Czarna Kaczka/ Black Duck for authentic Polish cuisine. Try the Borscht (beetroot soup), it's very tasty. Also make sure you have pierogi somewhere during your visit. For breakfast I heartily recommend Milkbar Tomasza and the savoury pancake with spinach and cheese filling.",1728305046.0,2024-10-08 19:56:37
t3_1fxrmv5,sabbatical travel from Canada,"So next year I'm on sabbatical. When I say next year, I basically mean September 2025 to June 2026 (I'm a teacher...that's a year for me with summer being a bonus!lol)

I'm hoping to travel as much as my money will allow. We live in Montreal. My son is off one week in November and one week in April (Easter) so I'm looking for a destination with him. He will be 15 and obsessed with Disney. We have already been to the Florida and California ones. He wants to be an imagineer when he's older. Some ideas: Paris with Disneyland, a Disney cruise from Florida, Greece (he's also into mythology and Percy Jackson). He's not a picky eater which is good for traveling and loves museums. 

My daughter will have the first three weeks of January off. She will be 18 and is very easy going. Not really into museums. She wants to learn how to surf and is super into Asian culture (but Japan is a no no which will be explained later). I was thinking Vietnam, Costa Rica, a cruise, New Zealand, a cruise, etc. We can also do a group thing (Intrepid or G adventures). She will not travel somewhere where she needs an extra vaccine! lol!

At some point during my break I'm planning on going to Japan with my husband. Just the two of us. We aren't sure when, probably October or early March (before blossoms). I think we should add South Korea since it's close.

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I am not bound to specific vacation times like when I'm teaching. Usually I can only travel during the summer (which is too bad since we have great weather here and have a pool we like to enjoy), Christmas or March break.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

t3_1fxphd8,"First timer Q’s- Finding other backpackers + transit+weather: France, Italy, Prague, Vienna","Hello everyone! I’m backpacking south of France, Italy, Munich, Prague, and Vienna later this month. I had a few questions for all you experienced backpackers!

Social: As a first time solo backpacker, I was wondering about meeting other backpackers and the social scene. I know hostels have event but they’re usually a miss than a hit. Anyone have tips? What should I expect/my mentality be going into this? I’ve always wanted to get to know with other people and idk if there are social circles for that.

Transit: How do you get around? Do I bring cash? Is there an app? Pay in person? i.e. Going to Nice, France and wanted to travel to sites a few hours away. Same with Milan and other places.

Weather: I realized the weather forecast is pretty rainy and colder. Clothing recs?

t3_1fxp2jj,Recommendations for a beach.,"Wondering if anyone has some ideas for places for my friends and I to get together for a beach week that's (relatively) easy to fly to from Dublin, Boston, &amp; NYC (We're a spread-out friend group)?  The challenge is that we're forced to do it during Christman &amp; New Year's (I know, I know) because of scheduling. From what I can tell, we'll be paying 4x the amount, which sucks, but it's the only thing that can work.  So, if there's a way to balance keeping costs down wherever we can vs. might as well enjoy it since we're gonna pay too much, I'm all ears.  
The places that seem geographically viable are the Canary Islands, Various spots in the Carribean, or the south of Spain, but we're open to any suggestions within these places or beyond them.  Would appreciate any advice.

t3_1fxtzko,Viva Aerobus price gouging ,"Has anyone else experienced this with Viva Aerobus? I tried booking a domestic Mexican flight, but the price was insanely high. So, I asked a friend in Mexico to check the cost locally since it’s the high season, and the price turned out to be one-fifth of what I was seeing!

However, the moment he entered our American info, the price shot up by 500%. When we tried booking through a travel website, the correct price showed, but once again, when we used our American details, we got an error saying there were no available tickets. This happened repeatedly over three days.

Is anyone else seeing this kind of price gouging for non-Mexican travelers?",1728257455.0,2024-10-08 19:56:37

I am an Spaniard travelling to Canada. I am flying to Detroit and crossing the border there to Canada. In the ESTA application, it asks whether you are in transit in the US.

t3_1fxnfc4,How to setup a trip through the Pacific Northwest in August with a toddler,"We are a couple with a 3 year old kid and I’m in charge of suggesting an itinerary for a trip next August. 

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

t3_1fxk2d5,13 Day Itinerary Check - Switzerland,"Hello! I tend to be an overly type A, ambitious person when it comes to traveling because I want to see everything I possibly can. I also love planning and making itineraries.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

We're aiming for mid-late May 2025. Thank you in advance!

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast. While sometimes we decide a full packed day is worth it, we often like to go out and do something, come back to the hotel and nap/chill, and go back out for the late afternoon/evening.

t3_1fxgsrz,Should I tweak my New Zealand Itinerary to add 1 night in Hawke's Bay?,"I am planning a return trip to New Zealand's North Island after doing a 2 week trip to the South Island last year. I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

I’m looking for travel recommendations, considering I’m based in Mexico and earn in Mexican pesos (MXN). I’ll be traveling with my partner, so we’re particularly interested in destinations that offer a great balance between affordability and amazing experiences. Our budget isn’t huge, so we’re hoping to find places where the cost of living, food, and activities won’t break the bank but still allow us to enjoy what we love.

Some preferences:

	•	We both love beach destinations and sporting events/places.
	•	Open to both domestic (Mexico) and international destinations.
	•	We enjoy outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and trying local food.
	•	Safety is also an important factor.

t3_1fxdr8n,2+ weeks in Guatemala and Belize,"Hi,

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

What doesn't make sense to me is the trip from Atitlan to Flores as it's a 10-12 hours journey. But then it makes sense to get from Flores to Belize.

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

Would you amend the time spend in any of the placea above? I hear mixed opinions about Semuc Champey so skipped it as it's a long journey.

t3_1fxgmu1,Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

My family is looking at going to Peru to hike the Inca Trail this December around Christmas. I’m super pumped, I’ve always wanted to do this, so I have no objections. However, I’ve been thinking about the logistics, and am feeling a little bit hesitant now.

I am very concerned that I will lose weight during the hike.

t3_1fxbat3,Cairns/Port Douglas vs. Auckland for last big trip from Australia,"My partner and I have lived in Australia a few years and are currently in Hobart. We plan to move back to North America in the next year and are deciding between two options for our final big (expensive) trip - The Great Barrier Reef or New Zealand. 

Due to timing and cost, we can only spend a week, so we’d be limited to just one of the islands in NZ. Timing is in the next two months, which I know isn’t great as we get into rainy season for QLD, but that’s what works for our schedules. I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. ",1728200554.0,2024-10-08 19:56:37

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her. We’ve both been Booking members for almost the exact same amount of time, booked about the same amount (we go back and forth each trip), and are both at the same Genius level as well as the same amount of bookings away from reaching the next level.

Both on iPhones, same IP, same Genius level, about the same past spending.

And yet, she’s getting minor to massive discounts every time and I’m stuck more or less just paying the normal rate…

I know that itinerary 1 will be a lot more rushed so I am worried that I would not be able to see enough of each place, but I really do want to see Connemara National Park - so if anyone has any advice on what I should skip or which itinerary I should pick that would be great!



Thank you!!

t3_1fxf5z8,Asked to pay for stained sheets by the hotel,"Hello, I spent 2 nights in a hotel in Thailand, and had a nose bleed during the night, which left 2 stains of blood on the sheets. The hotel is asking me to pay the equivalent of 70$ for housecleaning, which is way more than I paid for the room for 2 nights…. 

I obviously don’t want to pay, because blood stains can be washed and the sheets already had some stains (small but still) and I think the price is insane. It’s also not specified anywhere in the room the cost of any of the items if they were to replace them.

My strategy is to go tell them I’m not gonna pay for stains that can be washed and definitely not that much. The main issue is I have my passeport as deposit (I know stupid) so probably I’ll have to pay hopefully I can negotiate.

Please help me, what would you do in this situation? I’m so annoyed",1728217030.0,2024-10-08 19:56:37
t3_1fxl3yr,Cairo really doesn't deserve the bad reputation.... ,"As the title says

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

t3_1fx8f8a,"Last months of our trip, Nepal or more SEA ?","Hey travelers,

my girlfriend and I are in the last month of our one year world trip and have a hard decision to make.

So far we travelled Argentina/Bolivia/Peru/Chile/Columbia/Mexiko/Japan/South Korea and now are in Laos. Our original plan was to go to north Vietnam (Ha Giang Loop) after Laos and then fly to India for a month and afterwards to the Philippines in December cause we gonna met some friends there.

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

So its basically 

Vietnam/India/Philippines/New Zealand 

vs 

Nepal/India/Philippines/Vietnam or New Zealand

I know this is really about personal preferences but still we would be happy for some input from other travelers. Both North Vietnam and Nepal were affected by the current floods so we are quite unsure about that also. Is is even possible to do the three passes trek that spontaneous ? Also we are travelling with hand luggage and would have to buy/rent a lot of stuff in Nepal.

Thanks !

t3_1fxblxi,How is this Switzerland itinerary for Jan?,"Me and my family will be in Lyon over January and we want to spend a week in Switzerland. It'll be me + partner and 2 kids (6 and 10).

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)",1728201948.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54
t3_1fwkv4m, Magic in Macedonia,"Macedonia took us by surprise. It’s not the first place people think of when they plan a Balkan trip, but man, it should be. We drove through Skopje, with its mix of old-world charm and modern quirks, and ended up camping by Lake Ohrid. The stillness of the lake, surrounded by mountains, had this calming effect—like you were in a different world.

One night, we met a group of Macedonian travelers who invited us to a small village festival. There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them. We nursed the van back to the nearest town, with every downhill stretch feeling like a gamble. A quick fix at another local garage got us going again, but it was a reminder that this adventure came with real risks.",1728112764.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54

I'm planning a trip to Europe for May of next year, where I will be traveling with my parents and sister for about 14 days. The current very rough outline is to fly into Prague, spending several days there and possibly adding day trips to Kutna Hora or other nearby towns. We would then make our way to Munich where we would also spend several days. We would end our trip in Switzerland, spending about a week there before flying out from Zurich. My questions are:

Are 14 days a viable amount of time for this plan?

Would it make more sense to rent a car or travel exclusively by train?

Are there any places along this general route that you would recommend visiting?

Where would you advise staying overnight or spending a day in Switzerland?

Our interests include sites with historical value such as old city centers, castles, etc, as well as museums and architecture. We also look forward to trying some good local beer and experiencing nature. I am looking into all of this myself of course, but I have seen some great advice for various trips in this sub and would love to hear what you all think! Thank you in advance.

In retirement planning, my wife and I want to continue to travel, but I have had recent realizations making me really think of how to do that once we're retired. We live in the USA. My worry is the realization that Medicare doesn't cover you if you're traveling to places like Europe or Asia. But at that age, it seems like a chance of an ER visit may be greater. Like if I'm 70 and had a heart attack, do you just screw yourself for the rest of your retirement? My current insurance provides health care abroad, but I'd hate to work to my death just for the health care. I'd also hate to not travel just for the chance I might have an ER visit. Do you just buy travel insurance for the trip to cover that? I've seen things like Faye but then I also read that they can be a pain to deal with and not pay out. thanks for any insight you all can provide.

Finally this is just a concept to follow as I just need a logical direction to follow geographically  , I tend to wing it so if I'm enjoying somewhere I may stay a few extra days and vice versa if Im not enjoying I'll just move on earlier, if I'm indifferent either way I'll just refer back to this plan.

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport? Also does anyone know Denver airport well? Would we have to switch terminals in order to get to the domestic departures gate from the international arrivals gate?

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1. I thought it might feel a bit more relaxing though to have the 3 nights at the end. 

Keen for some feedback on these itineraries and if I'm giving too much or too little time in certain cities. 

The search function here will get a lot of use from me, but any tips or recommendations would be wholeheartedly welcomed! Our first time in Spain. Into the usual stuff: food, vibes, sights, walking aimlessly, local experiences, etc.  ",1728147570.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54

Friday:

Friday night we are driving to holland in the evening to stay with a family member. We are considering trying sleeping bear dunes on the way down there since it’s in route from Mackinac to holland. We’ve also considered doing a second day exploring Mackinac island on Friday instead. Is it worth it to do two days in Mackinac or should we make the trip to sleeping bear dunes?

We’re tight on time, and trying to find a balance between seeing everything we really want to see and making sure we’re not constantly driving and rushing around. If we were to add a day, should we spend more time at pictured rocks, spend more time on Mackinac island, or try tahquamenon falls?

t3_1fw3r80,Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else.

t3_1fx4okn,Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues. Orbitz doesn't even need to admit any error. But they do need to fix it.

t3_1fx6l6t,how much money are you required to have to go from germany to the US?,"So I am very confused. I have never left the US, and have only been to four states here, so I don't know much about travel or anything surrounding it. 

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right?

t3_1fwzwzs,I have both travel insurance and travel benefits from my credit card - claim with both?,"Hi there, long time reader, first time writer :) I can't for the life of me find any information on this on the web and will call someone tomorrow. Just thought I'd throw it out there now and see if anyone has experienced this before:

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both? Just trying to see how to maximize my claims approval since I'm double covered..so why not?

t3_1fwkuuu,The Call of the Road (Croatia),"I remember the first time we hit the road in that old T4 van. Croatia was our starting point, and the Adriatic coast didn’t disappoint. We cruised through winding coastal roads, with the sea sparkling on one side and dramatic cliffs on the other. Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot.

t3_1fvoezl,"The Underrated Gems of Cáceres &amp; Merída, Spain","Extremadura is a region in SW Spain that even Spaniards don't visit that much. I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. ",1728094584.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54

t3_1fwj8tm,Collecting checked bag in Frankfurt and checking it for a separate flight 2 hrs later. Tips?,"I had to check my bag from Athens to Frankfurt (on Aegean). I need to check it again for Frankfurt to Seattle (on Condor) 2+ hours later. I asked in Athens and it was not possible for them to check it through. 

I thought it might be worth asking here for any tips to make that go as smoothly as possible.

I am non Schengen. I assume that I must stand in line and go through customs to do this, as if I am leaving the airport. I’ll collect at bag claim, then queue again at bag drop for Condor, and again to go back through security. Am I missing anything, and is there anything you can share that might make this go more smoothly? Is bag claim for Aegean very far from bag drop for Condor?

Should a couple of hours for this be enough? I’m a little nervous because before this trip I hadn’t checked a bag in 25 years, and in Athens I had to wait 45 minutes in a sauna for my bag to come out. I remember why it’s best to not check bags.",1728105824.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54

t3_1fwibd5,Planning a trip for March 2025 for up to two weeks; Suggested destinations?,"Title. I reside in Seattle, WA

March 2025 is when I'll be done with my grad school program, and as a reward I want to go on a solo travel for up to two weeks. I have several destinations that I have in mind and things I want to do there, and wanted to get estimates on how long it would take me for the stuff I want to do plus anything else you guys might suggest. I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum
* The Scottish highlands, Wales, the Lake District, Cornwall, the Cotswolds

**4. Japan (1.5 weeks?)**

Similiar to UK, I wanted to stay in Toyko initially, But I feel there's so much to explore in Japan. Really want to fit in time to visit an onsen at least for two days, and do stuff between Toyko and Osaka? Full list of things I want to do:

* Eat tons of sushi, ramen, curry, tempura bowls, and even a fugu sashimi
* Visit to Studio Ghibli Museum
* Visit to Tokyo tower
* Shibuya
* Onsen Trip, as I mentioned
* Shopping for some tax-free items cheaper compare to US; Maybe a Gundam Figure build kit or a Gibson Guitar?",1728102282.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54

I’ve had a look at these places and have listed out the particular ones that I would like to visit.

In Bali, I find Gili T, Nusa Penida, Ubud and Uluwatu nice but considering I’m only going for a week I would probably leave Gili T and Nusa Penida out. I am considering Bali but it honestly is my last option as how touristy it is kind of turns me off.

In Vietnam, I would really like to visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Hoi an. I am not sure if this is too many places for one week. Phu quoc is also on the list but I’ve heard it is a tourist trap (?)

Thailand. I haven’t really looked at a particular place in Thailand yet but I am considering visiting Thailand as it would be the “best” time to visit.

Disclaimer: Maybe this should be for r/ AskA""Nearly""Canadian, but I couldn’t find that particular group! Askacanadian moderated it out and the immigration reddits dont seem to cover it , so apologies for posting something oddly specific in r/travel 

I’m looking to book a sunny getaway this winter for my partner and me from Canada. I noticed there are several countries that a Canadian Permanent Resident can visit with their PR card and passport, even if the passport isn’t super powerful.

Has anyone traveled from Canada to any of these places (with PR card in hand + their *weak* national passport)? Are some more relaxed than others? Any tips or things to avoid (besides the usual travel advice)? I know I need to do more research once we decide, but I’m hoping for some personal experiences with immigration etc., like *how you fared with your all-inclusive trip to Cancun with Transat* or something(definitely avoiding USA stopovers!).

It was never an issue for me with my strong European passport, but I gather it might be trickier for someone with a weaker one like my better half. I just want to understand all the angles before getting her hopes up!

Seemed legitimate but due to being impacted by hurricane Helene, I couldn’t provide the confirmation code due to no service or WiFi (called via landline). They gave me a different number and gave me a 50% refund.

This week I had signal and wanted to see if I could get the other 50% as it would be helpful considering the hurricanes impact on us. Called the number above and they worked to see what they could do. They offered me credits for the other half and told me that it would be a $99 service fee for this since it was a manual refund. 

I believe I started to be scammed here.

I gave them my credit card info (I don’t think I should have done this looking back), and they sent me an email from: reservations@thebookingconfirmation.com. It was a receipt and information but it looks shady. The charge on my credit card also shows as: airtktservices(followed by a number). 

What really made me think I just got scammed is they said I would have to call a specific number in order to use the credits: +1-844-202-1445.

t3_1fw6nft,"I Need Advice With My Travel Itinerary (Beer Trip, Focusing on Belgium) — It's My 1st Time In Europe","Next year, I'll be taking a 22-day solo trip around Europe to celebrate my 40th birthday, starting with **Belgian Beer Weekend and ending with Oktoberfest**. My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi. But if I stay in Vleteren, I'll be able to walk there and back, depending on the distance between the hotel and In De Vrede. What do you think is the best way to proceed here?
2. The following day, Tuesday, I'm going to Florenville to visit Orval, in a journey over 5 hours.  So, would you advise me to leave from Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper, Vleteren or whatever?

If you have any tips on beer stores or beers you like to drink that I could buy, I'd be grateful.  
And I hope you can help me clear up my doubts about my itinerary and help me plan my trip.",1728067678.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54

This specific flight is in partnership with Japan Airline and is operated by JAL as well. 

I recently received an email from both AA and JAL saying my flight was changed. In the JAL email, they proposed to have my flight destination changed to HND instead, which would be great for me. I went through their process and booked the new flight. 

However this new flight is NOT in partnership with AA. At the confirmation page, I receive the following message (screenshot). When I check in my AA app, I see both flights been included (where the JAL flight doesn’t have a corresponding AA flight number)

Want to ask: 1) is it possible to pay for an AA flight and make a change to a JAL flight not in partnership with AA? 2) what’s the right next step here? Worst case scenario would be to have my original flight canceled and the new flight not go through.

Good Nature

Cultural scene

budget friendly

French Riviera (although that may be too expensive - honestly not sure as I haven't looked too deeply at prices for that area)

t3_1fvzqax,China in July - 15 days itinerary question,"Hello everyone!

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

Thanks in advance!",1728050084.0,2024-10-08 19:56:54
t3_1fw509b,Morocco 9-day itinerary tips,"Hi everyone! Me and my partner are going to Morocco for a 9-day trip in November (including travel days), it's our first time there and I would like some tips! It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

  
And if you have any other tips about Morocco and traveling there, please let me know :) ",1728063497.0,2024-10-08 19:57:10

Osaka to Shanghai Pudong = Peach Aviation (arriving 24:20)

Shanghai Pudong to Bangkok = Thai Lion Air (departing 02:40)

Luggage: HAND CARRY ONLY!

Layover time: 2 hours 20 mins

- Since we don't have any check in luggage, is it possible to just go to the transfer desk and get a boarding pass there? (Note: Thai Lion Air doesn't allow online check in for international flights according to their website)

- If not, do we have to apply for a transit visa just so we can go through immigration and customs and then check in again at the Thai Lion Air counter?

- OR can we just go straight to immigration and customs and they will issue us a transit visa there considering we are not leaving the airport and only getting out of airside so we can check in again?

With how variable constant rate changes are becoming, and how rapidly they can swing, what is everyone doing about this? Would you keep your reservation the same? Call the hotel and see if they’ll adjust? Book online on the new rate and cancel the old reservation? ",1728051226.0,2024-10-08 19:57:10

t3_1fwax5k,My experience traveling internationally with a drone for the first time.,"I recently (September 2024) traveled to Greece with my new DJI Mini 3 with a short layover in Istanbul, both on the way there and back. I flew on Turkish Airlines. This was not my first time traveling internationally, but it was the first time with that type of equipment and I was utterly stressed out about it. I purchased the drone specifically for said trip. I made the mistake of going down a Reddit rabbit hole and all it did was make me feel more uneasy about it to the extent that I was ready to leave the drone behind. I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone. I even went through the painstaking process of registering the drone in Greece and I felt even that was a complete waste of my time. Just thought I would share my experience.

I want to take my time while also seeing as many cool things as I can before I fly back to the my side of the globe.

  
I've got some ideas of what I want to see: definitely spend time exploring London and Berlin, stop off somewhere in the Netherlands, look into stopping off in Scotland or France (but I bet it will be very cold and dark in Scotland!). I'm super interested in the history and the culture, so looking for museums and old architecture, and anything else that will be a fun memory.

  
So my big questions are:

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

t3_1fvrfir,Urgent: Bulgarian airlines Lost Luggage Tag,"Hey!

I went on a work related trip to Sofia (Bulgaria) and I flew home to Lisbon (Portugal) two days ago. After arriving in Lisbon, I wasn’t able to find my bag and realized it had been lost.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice.

My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out. 

- assuming my flights go without delay, I will arrive at the airport at 10:30pm and my car rental from fox is scheduled to be picked up at 11:30pm. I am worried I didn’t give myself enough time to deal with finding my checked bags and dealing with customs or whatever. Can I just call the place in advance if I’m running late?

- We are scheduled to stay at the Luxor hotel for the first 3 nights but we will only most likely be checking in at like midnight - 1am the first night. Is this worth calling them in advance?

Hey, looking to get my hubs luggage for an Xmas gift for an international trip i am planning. We have never bought rolling/360 spinner luggage before and I'm wondering for international flights would a checked roller or a carry on roller make more sense? Our gift $ limit makes it where i might not be able to find a 2 piece set... so im asking if you could ONLY choose ONE what makes the most sense? (We are not the type to overpack)

Also in my research I keep coming back to travelpro brand. is this a sturdy/good brand? Anyone swear by any another brand (moderately priced)?

t3_1fvnxm4,Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) Exemptions,"Hi all,

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

I have also emailed the various embassies and consulates but 1) it's Friday and 2) I'm flying out next week and not currently in the UK, so keen to get as much info as I can from as many sources 😅 

Many thanks in advance!!!

Although I see this in their local and Regional plans, the reason I ask this is more or less to do with NordVPN. I know Saily was created by NordVPN which you may of heard has had multiple reports this year saying it doesn't work anymore.

I've been recommended to get an eSIM in addition to a VPN for China.

I'm looking at going to go to multiple countries around Asia, China being one. So I have been looking at Asia/Regional plans with good amount of data for good pricing.

I'm looking for one that will allow me to use Whatsapp and/messenger to call family back home (and having both an eSIM and VPN were highly recommended). So I'm wondering if Saily has been working fine for people even if NordVPN isn't?

I'm from Aotearoa (New Zealand) so the idea of a global eSIM is a bit tricky to find at a good price.

I budgeted about 6K total for the trip, is what I have leftover enough to have good food/cool experiences with?

For reference, just booked my flights via Delta and Aer Lingus for about $2500 total round trip for both me and my S/O, coming from Chicago. Booked all of our lodging for about $800 total for 6 nights. We’re staying in East Lothian (East Liston for 2 nights &amp; Haddington 4 nights).

So far as getting around is concerned, we won’t have a car. I’m hoping to rely on both ride share and the trains for travel around the coast (North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady, Musselburgh, Dunbar, etc). Any suggestions on what is most cost effective? Is this a reliable way to get around relatively efficiently? Obviously we’ll plan to do a lot of walking around in each village/area, but getting to each area is my main focus here. Is Uber reliable in that area? Are the trains fairly inexpensive? 

Still looking for cool pubs, restaurants, sights, etc in each of the places I mentioned. Obviously we’ll stumble on some hidden gems just walking around, but any suggestions are much appreciated!

Just fyi, I’d like to exclude Edinburgh for the most part. But I’d love for someone to change my mind! I’ve heard there’s a lot of tourist traps around the city and with that comes more excessive spending which we’re trying to avoid. 

Again, any advice and comments are much appreciated.

Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

I am going with 2 couples to Scotland in June 2025. We are staying in Edinburgh for 4 days and will do a lot of sight seeing and golfing duding those days. 

I need a recommendation between Fort William and Inverness for the remaining 3 full days that we have. We still want to stay in a town/village big enough to grab breakfast in the morning and some pubs and restaurants for the evenings. We would like to go and sightsee during the day whatever that might entail. We will have a car. Hiking, boat rides, island hopping, whiskey distilleries, lakes etc. we aren’t very particular but would be looking for around 8-10 hour excursions each day including the drive. 

I know this is probably not specific enough. Just looking for recommendations from maybe ppl who have spent a lot of time in both areas as “home bases.” What will give us a better and dare I use the annoying word “authentic” experience of the natural beauty of Scotland?",1727965415.0,2024-10-08 19:57:10

For details, I’ll be driving all the time, so no flights, but budget also shouldn’t be much of a gap to worry about since I came out here for work anyway. I enjoy all types of stuff, from the outdoors to historical stuff and the more fun activity type places, and my top priority is to do some awesome experience, see some amazing things, and have a blast before I head back home!

So my husband and I were originally going to Gatlinburg TN for our honeymoon however the hurricane has changed that. We are leaving early this Sunday(depending on how far we go) so October 6th, for wherever we go. We are quickly trying to find a new place and Colorado seems amazing! It's a bit away but it's beautiful and has everything we wanted. However, we have never been to Colorado. I've been researching things but I have a concern/concerns. I've been seeing things about altitude sickness, and would hate to get sick the 5 days we would be there for our honeymoon. 

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting.

t3_1fvpzkk,Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

t3_1fv2xzm,Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1727943901.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point).",1727943868.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

t3_1funws7,"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? ",1727895112.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

I’ve noticed other airlines like American, United, BA, and Lufthansa all turn their seatbelt sign off before even reaching cruising altitude. This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence.

Edit: for everyone replying “you should keep it on anyway when seated” I 100% agree with you and do that myself. I’m only talking about getting up to use the restroom, grab something from the overhead bin, etc. ",1727974645.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

t3_1fumo9j,Thoughts on this - starting your career early vs travelling the world whilst your young,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been pondering this question a lot lately and would love to get some diverse perspectives: Is it better to start your career early or to travel the world while you’re young?

I see the value in both sides and am struggling to decide which path to take. On one hand, I’m keen to establish my career and secure my future. On the other hand, I feel like I might miss out on incredible experiences and personal growth opportunities that come from traveling.

What are your thoughts? Have any of you chosen one path over the other? If so, how did it impact your life? Any advice or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot!

t3_1fv2tyc,EU and Schengen travel ban with travel thereafter ,"Hi there. 

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen? 

Exhausted google searches and relevant sites. Any information would be appreciated. 

Thank you.

t3_1fun8lm,16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

t3_1fuh6qq,Three weeks in Taiwan this November,"1. Is November a good time to go?  Ideally I'd get there early November and depart late November, but I am also open to arriving mid-November and departing early/mid December.  Is this a solid plan?  Anything I need to know about Taiwan in Nov/Dec that didn't come up in my rudimentary google searches?  It seems the weather will be good, but am I forgetting anything?  Rainy and Typhoon season will be over by then, but what else should I be thinking about?

2. Is three weeks a good amount of time to see the country?  I could in theory do 4 weeks.  How would you break up your itinerary if you were me?  A week in Taipei, then move on to another city?  Tainan is also on my radar, as well as Kaohsiung, Lukang, Hualien, Jiufen, Ershui, and Wulai (district).  Anything I'm missing, anything you'd skip?

To help you answer my questions, my interests include exploring urban jungles as well as quaint smaller towns on foot, checking out the architecture, any natural sights, lookout points, I want to try local dishes and eat what's on offer, I have an interest in any local festivals, local history, I would love to do a day hike or two (in a park or something more urban or a mix), I wouldn't be against doing some kayaking somewhere, and basically anything interesting that's specifically Taiwanese in a cultural (or other) sense would be on my list of potential things to check out and experience.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.  Any particular apps you recommend to use to book hotels?  Any train tips?  I would be interested in any scenic train rides as well.

I have some experience backpacking through Asian countries (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal) and am not worried about culture shock, am open to see everything on my own terms and generally not as part of an organized group..  Having said that, I am not against a day trip with an organized group to some interesting spot, as long as my whole trip isn't like that.  Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen to a guide as opposed to figuring out all the details for a day trip yourself.  Most of the time I want to be on my own on this trip though, unless I meet other travelers and we end up travelling together.

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.
I’ve been traveling to Europe for over two decades now, and always leave my passport in the hotel safe. The few instances I was required to provide valid identification, my DL always sufficed. Some instances:

Visiting the Alhambra;
Visiting Auschwitz;
Paying for a parking ticket in Verona (through post office);
Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

These are just a few that I remember. So, I just want to hear about the experiences of those who actually got into trouble for having only their DL with them instead of their passport. What happened?

t3_1ftupkt,Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Prep for the trip: Get travel adapters (they use EU plugs) If your phone needs it, get a eSim; for Google Fi, Turkey is included in the unlimited plan When we went in September 2024, US citizens did not need any additional visa for a stay &lt;90 days September is fairly warm still, pack light clothing with 1-2 sweaters/jackets for the airport and sometimes chilly nights

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place",1727805935.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

As a first step, please go to www.ba.com/managemybooking to see what options are available to you.",1727936827.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

t3_1fumtu7,"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

Possibly take the ferry to Fort de France for a night in Martinique, not sure if this is worth it or how it would work.

Take some form of transport to Soufriere to stay there for the remainder of the trip, so 3 or 4 nights. Beach days, exploring the town, and we want to hike the Gran Piton. Then fly back out through Hewanorra.

I’m currently living in the Netherlands (since past 7 years), and I’ve renounced my Pakistani nationality few years ago. I’ve traveled to about 35 countries across Europe, Asia, and America, and one destination I’ve always wanted to explore is India. I’ve heard so many wonderful things about the cities, culture, and landscapes from my Indian friends here in the Netherlands, which has made me even more eager to visit. I’ve actually wanted to travel to India for quite some time now, to experience everything I’ve heard about firsthand.

I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into how difficult or easy it might be to get a visa for India as someone of Pakistani origin? Are there any specific restrictions or places I might not be able to visit because of my background?

I’m just looking for any helpful information or experiences regarding the visa process and any potential travel limitations. I would really appreciate your advice. I’m approaching this with the utmost respect and a genuine desire to explore and learn.

t3_1ftl7an,Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.",1727780037.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

t3_1fu4hfm,Solo traveler planning Alsace wine + foodie trip 12/2 - 12/5. Recommendations please!,"I'm a 38/F planning a solo trip to Alsace in early December and am trying to figure out my itinerary including where to stay, eat, and the best options for visiting wineries! I'm hoping for some recommendations on how to cut costs where possible and spend more where it counts.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne. Historically I've done semi-private tours but I'd definitely be open to saving money if I can get around by myself either via car or the Kut'Zig - I'm not sure if there are wineries that are easy to access/open to the public or by appointment to someone outside the industry.

I also would love to hit up the Strasbourg Christmas market for maybe an afternoon, but wine, food, and wandering/exploring are higher priorities for this trip vs. more ""touristy"" activities like visiting castles, etc. 

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access. Wherever I stay, I'll mainly be there just to sleep but it's important that it's safe and clean, but would flex for the right experience (again as long as I can make up for added costs elsewhere!)

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days? 

Budget: im hoping to get the price under 2.000$ just for this week for hotels, food and daily activities.

Since we are probably not going there anytime soon anymore we would like to add as much as possible.

If so would you do it again? Would you recommend partial or full? Is it insane to go to Panama city for just a day to go through the Canal?,1727848517.0,2024-10-08 19:57:26

t3_1fucwpf,Boarding pass not assigned at check in (online),"Is it just me or have others noticed that there airlines seem less likely to assign a boarding pass when you do online check in? Seems like I always used to check in online, get my boarding pass, and then show up at the airport ready to go.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass. But that means having to go and line up at the  bag drop line and that can take an hour at least. As I have no bags to drop that makes for a very frustrating experience!

  
Edit: this is flights to/from US, UK, France, Netherlands.

This seems like a new frustration and has happened on BA, Air France and KLM on my last few flights.

Is there a trick I am missing here? Let me know if this is just normal nowadays or or if there's something I am doing wrong.

Example airline email:

Dear passenger, 

You have successfully checked in! Please note: We cannot provide you the boarding pass online now, you need to obtain it at the airport.

**How to obtain your boarding pass:**

* Come early to the airport on the day of your flight to make sure you have enough time to obtain your boarding pass.
* Go to a check-in counter, even if you travel with hand baggage only.
* Once all necessary steps are taken, one of our agents will provide you with a boarding pass to go through security checkpoints and to board your flight.",1727864783.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43
t3_1fu7qpc,Iberia Missed Connection and Cancelled Flight ,"Hello Everyone, 

Long time lurker and first time poster looking for some guidance please. 

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

t3_1fu4o30,What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible. 

I posted on my Instagram story what happened and had 13 ppl reaching out that they went through the same thing with AirSerbia :(((((/ one of my friend who is originally from Belgrade sent me an email address that is at their LOST AND FOUND office door in Belgrade ( ???? ) and after I sent an email there, they responded that my baggage was still in Belgrade ( ???? ). When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!!

t3_1ft24dp,"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

I'm kicking off a solo adventure around a few spots in SEA with a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and was wondering if its worth staying in a hostel or if I should just go with a regular hotel. Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

To travelers who have been to KL before, is it worth trying to stay in a hostel or should I just play it safe and start off in a hotel?

t3_1fu51xf,Has anyone staying at Dubai International Hotel in DXB airport been able to leave and re-enter?,"Background:   US citizen. 17 hour layover in Dubai before my connecting flight with fly Dubai. Room booked at the Dubai International Hotel at the airport. My checked luggage will be tagged through to the final destination and I will obtain all boarding passes needed when at the origin airport. 

Question: Will I be able leave and return to airport hotel to sleep before my flight? I know I’ll have to clear customs to leave and that is fine. However, I’m reading conflicting information about not being able to return to the hotel until 3 hours prior to flight when check-in opens. I’m assuming I will already be checked in given that I’ll have my boarding pass to final destination and my luggage is checked all the way through. So, I’m not sure if hotel access only 3 hours before flight applies to me. I’d really like to explore in the afternoon and return around 10 pm. 

Has anyone done this recently? Any help would be appreciated. ",1727833553.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43
t3_1fu03t7,Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?",1727819290.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43

t3_1fst66x,"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",1727695522.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43
t3_1fso6rm,12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

t3_1fsu2ec,Hotel / Resort fees getting out of control?,"
Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

My only requests for this trip are trying a NYC hotdog and a slice of pizza (LOL), seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, going to the American Museum of Natural History, and finding some good dessert spots/other eateries. He is not a sweets/sugar person so he has left me in charge of that.

I am planning a trip to Morocco and in my plan, I'll take the ferry from Tangier to Tarifa, then local transportation to Malaga. Simple answer to this route, rather than just fly away, is that I wan to try something fun, and the Strait of Gilbralter is on my checklist as well. The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

However, I'd like to consult your experiences if I should do Tangier-Tarifa or TangierMed-Algeciras.

I will be staying in the town of Tangier, for the eve.

Besides, I am a bit uncertain about the local transportation between Tarifa and Algeciras. Rome2Rio tells me that there are regular bus routs operated by local transportation company. My concern is that what about the fare and how should I pay the ticket? Does it take credit card? or I should buy the ticket somewhere?

After arriving Malaga, I will be staying Malaga for 2 nights and then fly back. Should I book my day tour to Granada and Alhambra?

Day 1 (Oct 13): PM - arrive late to Montreux from Geneva, dinner. 

Day 2: AM - Walk to Chillon Castle, boat tour if time/weather line up. 
PM: Lavaux vineyards walk (Cully -Saint Saphorin). Dinner there/Montreux. 

Day 3: Gruyeres - chateau du Gruyeres, HR Giger Museum (we are Alien fans lol), etc. Train back to Montreux/dinner 

Day 4: AM - train to Zermatt 
PM - Stellisee lake weather permitting/Zermatt bopping 

Day 5: AM - Early Gornergrat, Riffelsee, proposal 🥳. Matterhorn glacier if time/weather 
PM: BEAUSite spa. Dinner at Omnia. 

Day 6: AM - train to Wengen. 
PM: Mannlichen-kleine schedegg if weather permits/lauterbrunnen valley option 

Day 7: (all options) Murren North face hiking, gimmewald, Eiger Trail, schilthorn, jungfraujoch

Day 8: see day 7. Mix/match accordingly 

Day 9: AM - lauterbrunnen valley 1 last time. Train to Lucerne. 
PM - bop around Lucerne 

Day 10: Lucerne City exploring. Old village, museums, boating weather permitting, etc. 

Day 11: rigi/pilatus/stoos ridge (still deciding - open to suggestions). 

Day 12: AM: train to Zurich (maybe stop in Zug for lunch??). 
PM: bop around Zurich 

Day 13: Zurich exploring, museums etc. 

Day 14: depart 

Weather may dictate some of these days. Have thought about training to Bern on any rainy days or other locations. We are pretty flexible and enjoy both hiking and city exploring. Have lived in Colorado for many years and understand October hiking will be layers, beanies, gloves.

t3_1ftmues,"Looking for advice, TAP or KLM for a trip to Brazil?","Hi everyone, I want to travel to Brazil (FLN, return from BSB or GYN) from the Netherlands (AMS) in March. The only viable options seem to be TAP (via Lisbon) or KLM (via São Paulo or Rio).

Something that's important to me is possibly being able to get assistance. I'm autistic, I can take care of myself so it's not a necessity but it'd help a lot. I know the sunflower lanyard is known with KLM but TAP doesn't seem to be trained with it. I'm not sure if it's known with the domestic airlines in Brazil.

I also have some questions about the São Paulo/Rio airports. What's it like having to switch from international to domestic flights? Do I have to check in all over again, is it far away? Is it easy to find English speaking personnel? This is one of my boyfriends' worries since I don't speak PT very well.

I saw I'd possibly have to do a ""self-transfer"" in Lisbon, what is this like? Also, does anyone know if TAPs prices ever lower again? The price recently got raised and hasn't gone down again.

To me the TAP flights seem easier, times are perfect (good layovers too!), but I'm not sure how reliable they are. I read a lot about baggage rules, but I don't mind putting in extra effort to make sure I'm not going over the limits. To be honest, I'd do that no matter the airline. What would be the best choice in my case? TAP or KLM?",1727785686.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43

Is this too good to be true or a scam? I don't want to book her ticket, have her show up at the airport, and this isn't even legit. The Indian embassy is useless here too, as there is no number to call, and if you make an appointment, they can barely speak English or convey anything properly.

So I said great I'm in the right spot. However, both those lines were going on 2 separate buses to the same place. When it came time to scan my ticket the driver said ""this isn't your bus"". I said how? I was told to come to this line and it's going to my destination. He said you missed your bus. And no, I did not come late. I was an hour in half early, my bus literally left minutes before. I asked can he please let me on the bus he said ""how much you got"" and was saying other very rude stuff to me but I digress. I lied and said I only have $20 so I gave him cash for him to let me on the bus. 

I contacted greyhound only wanting to get a partial refund of $20 on my ticket but they are of course saying it's nonrefundable. How is this my fault at all? Their app clearly said get in line D or E and the employee told me line D. The employees didn't even do calls for which bus is going where. You just had to assume what like to get in.

t3_1ft5pl2,7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)",1727728123.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

Sincerely,

Highly anxious Male, 26, currently smoking their cigarettes. ",1727774295.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43
t3_1ftqahj,Is a 5 hour flight then 4 hour train journey doable?,"Hi there.  Is a five hour flight and then a four hour train journey doable without becoming exhausted?

I am suppose to be flying (from Istanbul at 11:50am) to Casablanca Mon, 28 Oct, arriving **14:50** (5h flight duration) and was planning to take a train from Casa airport to Fez (four hours), where I would check-in to a hotel for three nights.

However, I'm now wondering whether this is a bad move.  Should I check-in at a hotel in Casablanca for one night, then travel to Fes the next morning?

Alternatively, if it's during the day (and it is) and I can travel first class by train (and no need to pre-book - just turn up and get the next train - there's one every hour), then should I be okay?

I'd rather go straight to Fes (have nothing to do in Casa), but I don't want to exhaust myself either.

Arrival: BCN 

Direct flight   A300-200 

  
**My parent's flight to Barcelona**

1. they purchased a ticket months ago. One way ticket.

**Problem** 

1. Cancelation  A day before the flight, the initial flight was canceled, and they got re-assigned to a different flight day later. 

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. ",1727729597.0,2024-10-08 19:57:43

Racism &amp; Overall Safety - I’m an Asian woman so… I never had unpleasant experience in any part of Austria but was wondering about Amsterdam.

We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year. We only speak English (and Chinese but obviously won't be helpful in Georgia!)

t3_1fsynxo,Is the Hopper website legit? ,"I'm looking for flights to Paris from Toronto for a week starting October 17/18, and everywhere else I have checked is charging at least $900 in total, but when I checked Hopper, it's saying my overall trip will cost $641, which seems too good to be true.

Our flight from JFK got cancelled 24 hours before check in, and they rebooked us which now gets us getting there on the 3rd.

t3_1fru0rh,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",1727575803.0,2024-10-08 19:57:58
t3_1fswfii,Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia. 

I would love any feedback, location suggestions, or just to hear your favorite places to spend a week! Thanks!!",1727705308.0,2024-10-08 19:57:58

t3_1ft9id1,Bachelor Party Recommendations? (I'm the Last to Get Married),"So, I'm the last to get married among my group of guy friends and the last to try to plan a bachelor party. Admittedly, I've fallen a bit behind on planning something (I get married in May 2025). My fiance and I have another trip planned in March 2025 (Mexico), so I'm looking at either February or April for when to travel.

Among my friends, we've already done Vegas, Destin, Nashville, Charleston, hometown, and many who have elected to do nothing (multiple elopements and a Covid wedding). It's a group of roughly 10-12 guys. We are all in our early 30s. We're into good food and drinks, games (any kind, I've seen them turn a bottle cap into a drinking game), professional (and unprofessional?) sports, beaches, pools, and water activities. Not big clubbers, golfers, or hikers.

Personally, I love to cook, I like a boat and a lake, to visit an art museum, I tend to be nerdier, and my games of preference are card and board game.

Things that have been batted around in conversation: Ireland (too far for the dads), Montreal, Banff, Lake Tahoe, All Inclusive Resort (don't know where), Lakeside Cabin (don't know where), Austin, Chicago. Not sure if those primers help!

* Dates: February or April 2025
* Locations: Canada, USA, Central America, Caribbean
* Group Details: 10-12, 30ish yo Males, located on East Coast USA
* Vibes: Beers, Good Food, Games/Group Activities, Water (a plus, not necessary)
* Not Vibes: Clubs, Golf Courses, Appalachian Trail

t3_1ft45ni,Where to solo travel for 5 nights in late October for some type I fun?,"I have a week off between jobs and want to make the most of it, but my husband won't be able to join me. I have done some solo travel before and have learned that I'm happiest with small group tasks/activities during the day, otherwise I get a bit aimless and lonely. I am outdoorsy but more into type I versus type II fun. I'm fairly competent on bikes and horses and hikes, but I don't want to summit any mountains and I get lonely camping alone.  I live in a city and prefer nature when I travel.

  
Given all of this and my late October timeframe, any ideas on where to go?  I am on the east coast of the USA and would prefer to remain within a reasonably easy flight (while avoiding any areas that are at a high risk of a hurricane).  I am seriously craving sun after the recent weather here, post Helene.  I can comfortably spend 2-3K on this trip.

Ideas are either:
A) Somewhere super relaxing but hot so it’s a change and we can go in a pool / chill outdoors. 
In my head this would mean going quite far to say Bali or Mexico…

B) Say f*** it and be those people that take a baby to Japan because I’m dying to go.

C) Road trip round the states
Can’t decide if this is stupid given we can only drive 2 hours before taking breaks with the baby… 

D) Alternative ideas in Europe that avoid a longer flight?!

t3_1ftfa1m,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",1727755390.0,2024-10-08 19:57:58

We're leaving our 3yo at home with the grandparents and this might be one of our last kid-free trips. I'm torn between wanting to make the most of it and actually relaxing. Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.

t3_1fsoc62,Vietnam Itinerary Help (13 Nights),"Hi, we will be in Vietnam 13th-26th October (13 nights), we had an idea on where we wanted to go and how many nights to spend in each but when it comes to actually planning it, I am not sure if we should drop Hoi An so it doesn’t feel rushed. We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)
17th: Overnight train to Ninh Binh
18th: Ninh Binh (arrive in morning from train)
19th: Ninh Binh
20th: Return to Hanoi (for Ha Long next morning)
21st: Ha Long Cruise (overnight) 
22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa
25th: Hanoi
26th: Flight home (evening)

This results in a total 5 nights in Hanoi, 2 nights in Hoi An, 2 nights in Ninh Binh, 1 night in Ha Long, 2 nights in Sapa, and 1 on a train. Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

Thanks.

She recently told me she would like to see something different and agreed to go somewhere abroad with me. We’re from a Mediterranean country, so preferably something northern. I only care about two things: for the city to be safe and for it to have plenty of things for people her age (60) to see. Any suggestions?",1727631246.0,2024-10-08 19:57:58

t3_1fsqxf2,Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!",1727685997.0,2024-10-08 19:57:58
t3_1fsq39w,How to book Rainbow Mountain and Manu National Park (Amazon) tours from Cusco,"Hi,

I'm going to be in Cusco around last week of Oct to early Nov. After doing some research I've read that its cheaper to book these tours in person through local tour companies than online but I'm worried about them filling up and not being able to book with a good agency, especially for Amazon. Can anyone who's been there advise?",1727682024.0,2024-10-08 19:57:58
