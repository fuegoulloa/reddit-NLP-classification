t3_1fv4vli,Just how many people have been scammed by edreams? ,"I recently found I was charged 60 euros by a travel company called edreams. I had never booked a flight with them, so I contacted them via email, and they were kind enough to answer that they would help me identify the transaction.

After one month of back and forth emails, they apologized and let me know that while they DID charge me for a subscription, **there was NO account under my name, email or telephone number.**

The story should have ended with a refund then and there, but they also let me know they would NOT be refunding the money. They were also unclear on how or where they got my credit card information.

This is where I started digging, and I found **they have been doing this for years!**

Any google search for edreams will immediately bring up hundreds of social media posts with the same fraudulent charge disguised as a ""subscription"".

At this point, out of personal interest, I'm interested in collecting names and testimonials from other people with that have unknowingly ""subscribed"" to an edreams membership. 

I think there's a clear case for consumer fraud, and I'm sending this to a couple of European consumer agencies!"
t3_1fv4z6a,Required to carry significant amount of cash to Thailand,"I was told by my tour organizer that we are required to carry THB 20,000 per adult when visiting Thailand and is not just sufficient to show this as a bank statement. How true is this? I am an Indian traveling from India to Thailand. Thanks in advance."
t3_1fvgocr,First time in a hostel,I am heading out to London and Wales next week. I am staying in a hostel for the first time and am going to be alone in London. I am staying with friends in Wales. I travel alone lots but this is the first time without joining a group tour and now I am getting nervous. Does anyone here have advice to calm me down. And convince myself the hostel is going to be fine and I am not going to regret staying in one. 
t3_1fvaxy8,What is it with every business begging for Google or TripAdvisor review?,"I’m currently in Egypt (spoiler: I love it), and I was wondering why is it that every business asks for Google or TripAdvisor review? They also ask for the waiter/tour guide/contact person’s name to be mentioned in the review. I kinda can understand that tour agencies need it to boost their sales, but an established 5-star resort? It feels a bit off-putting. And this is not in Egypt only. Last year in Jordan, a dude literally waited over my partner’s head for a Google review in a 5-star hotel. 

Can anyone shed some light on this?"
t3_1fueq0d,Ten days in Brazil 🇧🇷 ,"Recently I had the chance to visit Brazil and wanted to share some of my picture and experiences.  I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

Thanks for being a great host Brazil, Obrigado!"
t3_1fvhpl2,International Driver's Permit for Vietnam,"I'm looking to rent motorbikes while in Vietnam. I have a valid U.S. driver's license for passenger vehicles - but I don't have a motorcycle license.

Do I need an IDP for motorcycles to rent one in Vietnam? If so, do I need a motorcycle license in the U.S. to get the IDP?

I've heard Vietnam only recognizes the 1968 IDP, how do I know if I'm applying for the right one?"
t3_1fv9dcs,14h&amp;2h or 7h&amp;10h flight combinations? Which would you prefer? ,"I am flying from the east coast of the United States to Windhoek Namibia. Which would you prefer or recommend?

8:55P NWR to JNB 6:36P local (14h) &gt;&gt; 16 hour layover &gt;&gt; 10:40A JNB to WDH 12:50P local (2h)

5:50P NWR to FRA 7:25A local (7.5h) &gt;&gt; 14 hour layover &gt;&gt; 10:00P FRA to WDH 9:15A local (10h)

I am torn. First about me: (1) No business class (2) I sleep on flights. Not necessarily well but I can pass out for an entire 7 hour red eye flight. (3) I have been to Frankfurt before.

My thinking is that if I sleep on the 14 hour flight to JNB and then land at night... Won't I be unable to sleep and awake all night unable to do anything? If I go to Frankfurt I'll still get a hotel maybe sleep from 8AM to 12PM local and then have at least 8 hours to explore, have a nice dinner?

Some people say just get it over with and do one really long flight. Thoughts?"
t3_1fvavhr,Where to take a train from Amsterdam?,"My wife and I are planning a two-week trip to Europe in early December. I've never been, and she's been to Catania and London. We're thinking about flying into Amsterdam as tickets look relatively affordable, and we want to travel by train to 1-2 cities in different countries. We don't mind a long train ride, but would like to save money if possible. Where do you all reccommend to travel?"
t3_1fvfghu,6 month Expiring passport ( CAD&gt;PH),"Hi everyone just wanted to ask as I am a little confused on the 6 month rule for entering the Philippines. My husbands passport (Canadian) expires June 9, 2025. We are entering the Philippines Dec 7, 2024-Dec13 for a quick trip. 

Does the 6 month rule apply From the day we enter or exit the Philippines? Wasn’t sure if it was worth renewing if he’s only a few days short of the expiry. thank you! "
t3_1fvi144,Baggage Storage Cairo,"Planning a two part trip to Asia and then later on to Egypt. I have a large bag I will be using for paragliding that I will not need on the second half of the trip to Egypt. Does anyone know if the Cairo airport has some sort of baggage storage while we are in the country for the week? We don’t want to carry the extra bag around when we don’t need it.

Thanks!"
t3_1fv6tud,"Looking to take first ""nice"" trip with wife after recent family tragedy. In US, late October/early November. Looking for: quiet, peaceful, nature, hot springs and/or warm weather. I guess a resort? This is all new to us, as we usually do more budget trips, hiking, etc.","Edit: HUGE thank you for the very thoughtful responses. We're going to do a more local trip this year, and take all of this info and start looking at a big trip for next year. This has been super helpful!!



We lost my wife's father this year and have both been doing a lot of work on ourselves, our relationship, and finding peace. I don't even know where to begin, but I kind of have a picture in my mind. I'm intentionally leaving price and region vague as I'm curious what comes to mind when you read what I'm looking for, and we are flexible in these departments. We are not wealthy, but are dual-income, no kids, and never treat ourselves. Mid-30s.

Must haves: Quiet, beautiful, access to nature/hiking trails, either warm weather or moderate, hot springs or hot tubs outside, good food, everything we need on-site. We're looking for romance, privacy, healing. A day spent reading, strolling a trail, and having healthy food would be the perfect day.

Would also love: horses or other animals, no kids, yoga

Do not want/need: party vibes, stuffy, corporate, cell service, internet, TV, alcohol

You know that show *Intervention*, at the end when they send people to these rustic places out in the desert to put their brains back together after years of hard living? It might sound funny but that's what I keep thinking of!"
t3_1fv2ci5,2 month train loop of France,"Hi everyone, I am in the beginning stages of planning a 1-2 month trip around France next September entirely by rail. I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille. 

This is a lot, so thank you very much for reading it and any advice you have for me!"
t3_1fudlmf,Trip to Hongkong🇭🇰,"Hong Kong can be describe like state in state. Even tho It’s officialy part of China, this special administrative zone have their own parliament, currency, army and even visa policy. You can travel here visa free. Hong Kong was for a long time part of British empire and you can see british influence everywhere (architecture, food and even language). Unlike the most of China, people in Hong Kong are more fluent in english which can be really helpful when you can’t find specific location. I can only recommend you to visit. 

Places on the photos:
1. Nan Lian Garden
2. Central Hong Kong
3. Tian Tan Buddha 
4. Viewpoint from Victoria peak
5. Statue of Bruce Lee
6. View from Avenue of Stars
7. Wisdom path 
8. Choi Hung Estate 
9. Street in San Po Kong
10. Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple
11. Chi Lin Nunnery"
t3_1fvi4bm,Should we visit Krakow or Wroclaw?,"Hi all,

Me and a group of friends are organising a trip to Poland in late November and are trying to decide between Krakow or Wroclaw.

The one bit of extra info I’m curious to hear about (besides all the basic stuff like which is better, is one cheaper than the other etc) is one of the group mentioned that Krakow is conservative and slightly homophobic, can anyone speak to this one way or the other?

My personal preference is to go to Krakow but curious to hear people’s thoughts.

Thanks "
t3_1fvejry,"International trip soon, needing luggage advice for Christmas gift","
Hey, looking to get my hubs luggage for an Xmas gift for an international trip i am planning. We have never bought rolling/360 spinner luggage before and I'm wondering for international flights would a checked roller or a carry on roller make more sense? Our gift $ limit makes it where i might not be able to find a 2 piece set... so im asking if you could ONLY choose ONE what makes the most sense? (We are not the type to overpack)

Also in my research I keep coming back to travelpro brand. is this a sturdy/good brand? Anyone swear by any another brand (moderately priced)? 

Thanks!"
t3_1fvhkll,Which Eastern European city to start with?,"So, we're planning a trip to Europe in next few months. We are a family from usa which has already visited Western Europe and now we want to visit the other side of Europe to see what it has to offer and also to save money. We're wondering which country would be perfect for our criteriums - has something to offer for family, great cuisine, interesting landmarks for reasonable prices. Guess all of them are cheap. We've already been to Greece, Italy and France and liked it all, but now we want to see something different.

Which country would be perfect for us? Which is like the best to start exploring Eastern Europe?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Mistake in post name, wanted to write a country, but also we want to visit a city in that country for sure :)"
t3_1fvcw14,Visiting Cotopaxi in Ecuador without the hike ,"I'll be visiting Ecuador for about a week coming up.  I'll be in Quito for a couple days and then descending down to the amazon for 5 days.  I then come back up to Quito and was looking at going to Cotopaxi for the day. 

  
My only concern is the hike up the side of the volcano will be very difficult because of the altitude and I will not have time to acclimatize in Quito beforehand.  

Has anyone done the Cotopaxi hike without acclimatizing beforehand?  

Are there any ways to visit the national park and base of Cotopaxi without doing the hike? "
t3_1fvbygf,From Laos to China with train?,"Hello everyone!
I'm traveling in Southeast Asia for a few months soon. I'm currently planning my approximate route and have seen that you could theoretically take the train from Laos to South China (Laos-China-Railway). 
Of course, I first checked what the conditions for a visa are and it seems to be relatively easy at the moment (visa-free entry). In other words, German nationals can enter China for tourism purposes for up to 15 days.
Unfortunately, I can hardly find any experiences or reports on the internet...

Have any of you had experience with the train and entering China with this visa and/or by train from Laos? 

I would be super grateful for any advice 🫶🏽"
t3_1fve0i2,"Best Value Short Beach Vacation location for a couple... Mexico, Colombia, Dominican Republic, or other?","I'm an American, looking to vacation somewhere warm. I'd be taking my gf (we are in our mid 30's)

Ideally, somewhere that the weather is warm, the beer is cold, and is relatively safe. I don't really want to travel around and sight see. I mostly want to wake-up, go to the beach and drink, then go somewhere to eat. 

I speak a bit of Spanish, so a Spanish speaking country would be ideal compared to say a Portuguese speaking country. 

I've been to both Mexico and the D.R. (Punta Cana) and enjoyed both.

Any advice/city recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Again, trying to minimize cost without sacrificing much safety/good weather.

Thanks!"
t3_1fva2xz,Tivoli Gardens Denmark - Halloween or Christmas?,"Checked online and saw they have their Halloween theme coming up, and Christmas in late Nov.

t3_1fva2px,Multi-city trip flight costs,"Hi I’m(24m) going from Ohio to Vietnam to Japan then back to Ohio. I’m currently planning on traveling directing December to mid January and I’m buying tickets now. The cost is about 2.4k right now,which I’m not opposed to paying but what I want to know if there are any cheaper options. I know flights almost are never cheap but I’m optimistic and I’m always looking for a good deal."
t3_1fvicat,"We're visiting a Barcelona conference for a few days but want to visit another city in spain. Should we choose Valencia or Malaga? Are small towns such as Ronda, Frigiana and Nerja worth visiting?","My girlfriend's getting 4 days free stay because of a work related conference in Barcelona. We're thinking of making a trip out of it and going to another part of Spain for a couple days.

GF's visited Grenada, Seville and Madrid already so wants to see other (smaller) parts of Spain.

We'd be going in November. Nice weather's always nice but we know we're not gonna be tanning on the beach."
t3_1fvhxk5,Flight overbooked. Offered $1500 to take a later flight,"On a recent flight on Delta from Columbus, OH to Atlanta, the gate attendant offered $1500 to anyone that would be willing to take a flight the next morning. They needed two volunteers. They started by offering $1000, and a few minutes later bumped it up to $1500. That’s the most I’ve ever heard being offered. Unfortunately I was unable to do this. How much have others been offered?"
t3_1fvhw2q,Domestic flight into Manila to catch an international flight the same day on separate tickets?,"Our flight back to Europe from Manila departs at 9:30 pm. Is it crazy to book a separate flight from Puerto Princesa, Palawan for the morning of that day? 
My goal would be to kill some hours at the Mall of Asia in Manila and then return to the airport. The alternative is to fly in the evening before and spend the whole day in Manila before heading to the airport in the evening. 

I look forward to reading your input. Will I run the significant risk of missing my international flight in the evening when my domestic flight is delayed? Will Manila drive me crazy without a hotel room to relax? "
t3_1fvhvbe,Advice for Japan,"Hi!! I’m going to Japan this spring. I’ll be staying for a total of 9 days while traveling across Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Kyoto, and around Mt. Fuji. I was just wondering about like the etiquette surrounding clothing, cultural differences, tourist expectations—just anything I should watch out for! I was also wondering about money, like how much cash should I bring, and if I can use my debit card? Also if anybody knows any cool spots to go to in any of those areas!! I wanna try to do everything and anything. I know this has probably been asked before but I’m just so nervous and wanna know as much as possible before going. Thank you!"
