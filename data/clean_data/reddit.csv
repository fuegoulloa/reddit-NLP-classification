First-Time Homebuyers Torn Between House or Mobile Home—Help Us Decide,"(Edit: Thanks everyone for responses was very helpful and actually learned quite a bit! A lot of this is pretty basic I am sure for most you but you have taught me quite a bit with this. It's been very helpful and feel much more confident buying the home vs trailer now)  
  
Hi all,

Sorry for the long post. My wife and I are new to this and aren't sure what move we should make.

We both grew up in poor households, and after a few decades of hard work, we've finally reached a point where we are actually middle class, though still on the lower end. We’ve been paying so much in rent that we finally decided it’s time to buy a house. With the help of various programs and our savings, we've managed to save around $30,000 for a down payment.

For context, we currently live in one of the fastest-growing major cities in the U.S., and the city is expected to see a 75% population increase by 2050, so buying here seems like a smart move. We also don't have children, which helps our financial situation.

We’re currently weighing two options:

1. **House Purchase**: We could buy a decent house here for around $250,000 with a $30,000 down payment and an interest rate of around 6%. The monthly payments would be lower than our current rent, though we'd be responsible for repairs and maintenance. This would be a 30-year mortgage. While we’ve done well to get to this point, it’s required us to be very frugal (we both drive used cars, don’t vacation often, etc.). That frugality is how we saved enough for a down payment.
2. **Mobile Home Purchase**: A very nice trailer has come on the market in a trailer court, oddly located near downtown. The park has extremely strict rules, and the lot payment is $600 a month, though it’s subject to change. We can buy the trailer outright for $20,000. The trailer lot owners are also the sellers. We have no issue living in a mobile home, and being close to downtown is a huge plus. This particular park is well-run and well-maintained.

We're really torn between these two options. On one hand, we could get a small, comfortable house, but the payments would force us to continue living frugally and avoid things like new car payments. On the other hand, the mobile home is an easier, debt-free option, but I’m not sure if it’s a wise long-term decision. Given the proximity to downtown, the trailer lot could easily be sold off for condos, and who knows what the park might be like in 10 years? Also, if we go with the mobile home, we’d lose out on the first-time homebuyer programs our state offers for future purchases.

That said, being debt-free would allow my wife to finally get a decent car.

We've rented our entire lives and have no experience with buying a house. I thought I'd ask for advice here. We need to make a decision quickly, as the trailer likely won’t stay on the market for long at that price, and our real estate agent is eager to start showing us houses.

Any advice or suggestions on which route to take? For reference, our income should remain steady with about a 3% annual increase.",70,10,3057,547,0
Arriving at IAD Washington for the first time ,"I’m Autistic and I’m going in January and I will be getting there for around 5pm if everything works out. I’m flying from UK with a stop at KEF Reykjavik Iceland. I have an ESTA and I’ve previously went to JFK in 2019 so I’m very aware of how the wait can be. But I still have some lingering concerns and questions so I hope someone can help me. 


1: what happens after I land, as in where do I go/ is there signs?
2: how long is the wait at the security since I have sore joints 
3: I will be bringing a carry on and I have checked in luggage, how does that work? As in where will I put my carry on when I go through etc. (forgot what I done at JFK) 
4: Is there any toilets after the security and anywhere to meet someone after as I’m being picked up by my friend who is local 
5: is there any issues with things I may have bought at my original airport (EDI) between KEF And IAD

Breech contract from the builder,"Any advise would appreciate!

Travel suggestions for Nov and Dec on east coast,"Hi everyone,

My family is visiting from overseas in mid-November and will stay until Jan beginning. They live in a tropical country, so they've never experienced fall colors or snowy winters before. I live on the East Coast, and I'd love for them to experience as many things as possible. I'm planning weekend trips mostly so they can rest during the week (I have work, and my parents are in their 60s, so I don't want to overwhelm them).

Here's what I have in mind:

1. **Fall foliage:** Do any states still have fall foliage left by the 3rd week of November? I was thinking of taking them to DC, but I’m open to suggestions.
2. **Niagara Falls:** Is it worth visiting during late November/Thanksgiving weekend? How is the experience around that time?
3. **New York City:** Planning an overnight stay around Christmas/New Year and going to see the Statue of Liberty the next day. Which one would be better
4. 3-4 days trip to California to get them some sun and just relax on the beach.

If anyone has other recommendations, I’d love to hear them. I'm looking for ideas that would be easy on them  but still let them enjoy the best of what this season has to offer. 

Thanks so much in advance!",48,9,1197,210,1

Family friendly eco lodge in mainland Europe recommendations please (April travel),"Hi all,

We're looking for recommendations for an eco lodge type experience in mainland Europe for April 2024.

Current Google search is giving either Airbnb (don't want to self cater), Center Parcs type massive places (too big), or hotels. Or lovely little eco lodges that are absolutely not family friendly.

We'd love somewhere in the middle of nature... Little chalet accomodation, tents, sheds that sort of thing... Where you can walk about and be in nature... Trees, ponds, forests and the great outdoors. Small and family run is more our bag and family friendly is a must (absolutely minimum a playground or similar on site), as is a restaurant (I don't want to self cater). Would be great if there were activities on site or within an easy drive.

We're not really fussed about facilities so long as the place is clean and the food is good (previous holidays have been spent in sheds...)... Having said that, budget can go up to £4k for a week, so we can do high end if it's good enough.  ",82,11,997,174,1

"7-9 days in Argentina, what to do?","Im currently looking at a cruise that is from Europe to Argentina. I Would love to see moet of Argentina and want to add about a week there (7-9 days). Im going there with my wife. We are both mid 20s.

The cruise is dropping us in Buenos Aires. I would like to see the city, but next Im pretty unsure. I would like to see the most of Argentina and I can also add Uruguay or Chile to it if it is doable.

I havent booked any flights yet, so its very possible to end the trip in another country.

What I have seen so far is:

Day 1: From the cruise we can probably get off at 10:00-11:00. Explore Buenos Aires and go to hotel for lugage.

Day 2: Go to iguaza falls in the morning and take the flight back to Buenos Aires in the evening. We are just checking the side in Argentina.

Day 3: Christmas eve, spend time in Buenos Aires.

Day 4 and further: undecided… 

We are unsure what to do the next days. I have checked out Patagonia, but apparently you need more time there.

I have also checked out Easter Island, this is possible but quite expensive. Is it worth going there?

I can also get a flight and go to Uruguay or Chile if the cities / what the have to offer is worth checking out. I even checked Peru, but there again I need more time.

Anything else Im missing and is possible in those days? 

Budget: im hoping to get the price under 2.000$ just for this week for hotels, food and daily activities.

Since we are probably not going there anytime soon anymore we would like to add as much as possible.

Thanks!",34,7,1522,283,1
Would you rather?,"My Dad will be selling his house soon. It's a 1920s craftsman, really well taken care of. Roof is good, new siding, original woodwork, custom kitchen and bathroom etc. He'll likely get around 600k for it.

He does have asbestos in the basement and knob and tube. Don't ask me why he's never done anything about it in 33 years.

Would you rather pay a little less for the house in accounting for these issues? Or would you rather pay more for the house with all of these issues addressed already?


Edit: Thanks for all the feedback. I'll encourage him to talk to some realtors, and get some quotes. 

Concensus, not dealing with it will limit the buyers and the price. Dealing with it wouldn't guarantee a return on investment either. Both, not too surprising. 

I think he is just old, really doesn't want more projects and wouldn't care if he got less for it. ",17,3,862,153,0

Tapping into Home Equity to Invest in Rental Property,"I currently own a home with a 3.125% interest rate in NJ. I owe $178k on the loan, got it for very cheap prior to 2020, added a lot of value to it and it is safely worth over $800k. I want to spread out this equity with an investment property, but want to spend absolutely nothing on it. I want to own real estate so it can grow exponentially, and to take advantage of the tax benefits. 

Northern NJ real estate is very expensive. I do have family down in the Tampa Bay area that could help manage a condo or something, so this is an option that is more appealing as the prices there are a little more reasonable. 

What is the benefit of a HELOC vs just getting a mortgage on another property? Also, would it be a good idea to use the HELOC as a down payment and then put the mortgage on the property, and have the rental income pay both loans? 

Again, I am looking for a way to simply spread out the equity without tapping into cash, only tapping into the home's equity. I understand I will have to have a little cash for emergencies, and also will let the cash flow build up over the next few years (I don't plan on spending the cash flow anytime soon).

"Guest Canceled After Claiming Fraud, Now Demanding Refund","So, two days ago a guy booked a one-night stay at my place through Booking.com. We talked on the phone, and I explained that he still needed to pay cash when he arrives since Booking.com only held the amount on his card for confirmation. I told him he’d get a refund as soon as he paid me directly.

I'm new to the platform, but I travel a lot and this has happened to me many times with other hotels—where they hold your card and you pay cash when you arrive. It's nothing unusual, and the website even says I have to collect the payment from the guest.

But then he started getting really rude, calling us a scam and saying he’d report me to the police. I tried to explain politely (he’s a foreigner, by the way), but he wouldn’t listen and kept insisting we were trying to steal from him. After a long back-and-forth, I even offered to let him stay for free just to avoid any issues, since I didn’t want to deal with the police.

In the end, he insisted on canceling, even though it was past the cancellation period, but I went ahead and accepted it with no fees. Now, he’s asking for his money back and has already reported me to the police, but I didn’t get any money in the first place!

Buying a house in another state (with a job already)?,"We live in TN and are homeowners, but my work is largely based out of GA now as of a merger that took place in the last year. It would be way easier for me to develop my career/move up in my field if we moved to the Atlanta area, but things are complicated as we are homeowners and not renters. 

The easy part is this: I DO have a job already and my boss has already approved of my decision to relocate, saying all I would need to do is email HR to let them know I would report to the ATL office in the event that I did move. However, there remains the issue of the house we already have… and we would prefer to buy a home in Georgia instead of rent. Several reasons for that but mostly, we’re mid-30’s and have two kids and don’t really savor the idea of apartment living with two kiddos under 4.

Questioning selling my house ,"I bought my house for $150,000 back in 2018. I refinanced a 1.5 years later for a 2.5%rate at 15 years. I have $112000 left on the mortgage which I pay additional to principal every month.  The idea for the longest time was to continue to pay off my mortgage, eventually rent it, and purchase a secondary home to then live in. 

However, I’m considering selling my house to then purchase something which aligns with what I want some more space, bigger property etc. 

Houses similar to mine and in the area are selling for approximately $250000 right now/in the last few months. And houses which I’m looking at are around $400000 for what I want. 

If I were to sell, after closing costs etc. I would probably walk away with $100000 estimated just based off the area. 

Financially, sticking with plan A sounds like the best financially (money coming in long term, versus a lump sum out right to then invest into a new house).  There is not an option right now to immediately rent my house and purchase another one because I do not want to dip into my savings like that for a large down payment, and with it being a second property (I believe) specific lower down payment loans are not available.

Winter Sun Getaway for Canadian PRs: Tips and Experiences?,"Hey everyone!

I know I need to do more research once we decide, but I’m hoping for some personal experiences with immigration etc., like *how you fared with your all-inclusive trip to Cancun with Transat* or something(definitely avoiding USA stopovers!).

It was never an issue for me with my strong European passport, but I gather it might be trickier for someone with a weaker one like my better half. I just want to understand all the angles before getting her hopes up!  

Here’s the list I found online:

* All Dutch Caribbean territories
* Anguilla
* Bahamas
* Belize
* Bermuda
* British Virgin Islands
* Cayman Islands
* Costa Rica
* Cuba
* Dominican Republic
* El Salvador
* Georgia
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* Jamaica
* Kosovo
* Mexico
* Nicaragua
* Panama
* Peru (for nationals of China or India only)
* Qatar
* Saint Pierre and Miquelon
* Singapore (for nationals of China or India only)
* Sint Maarten
* South Korea
* Taiwan
* Turks and Caicos Islands

Thanks in advance for any advice! 🌞✈️",58,9,1705,268,1
Planning a 1.5 week trip to Spain,"Hi everyone, I'm planning a trip to Spain during my semester break and my current itinerary looks like this:

4 days Madrid, 4 days Valencia, 3 days Barcelona.

I need advice on whether I should cut short one day in Valencia for another day in Barcelona?

A tour of ancient cities in Turkey,"If you are interested in ancient cities you should go visit turkey 🇹🇷. In order there are Afrodita, Efes, Pergamon, Troy + Canakkale (the emblematic Trojan horse was under mentenance), Istanbul, Pamukkale, and old marina bay in Antalia.

Is it the Real Estate Agents' (buyer and/or seller) duty to investigate the status of property?,"I am in NY, i am the seller. Specifically my question is ""is it the listing Agents' responsibility to check the status of the home with the Building Department to see about open permits or more importantly the true Status  - such as how many bedrooms, bathrooms, legality of basement or apartment in basement? "" where does the responsibility of the sellers agent lie? Do we just wait til the pre-closing days and see what the Title Search says?

During the later stages of my contract, few days before the closing it came out that my home was originally permitted as a 3 bedroom house but in fact it was always a 4 bedroom; I know this because my father built it and it was passed to me. I quickly rectify the problem by visiting the BoH and finding out all that was needed was a larger septic tank, I installed it and cleared it with the BoH and Building Department. I eventually lost the buyer due to a series of unfortunate delays but the major delay was the 3/4 bedroom situation.  
I was told by 2 Real Estate agents that the agents for both are responsible to due diligence. Is this true and to what extent are they liable? 
I'm not the type to sue but I'd like the agents to take a point off the future Sale. 

Edit: To be Clear, I was not aware of the fact that it was in the Building department as a 3 bedroom.  It was always a 4 bedroom as far as I knew and the Tax Bill showed 4 bedrooms, so the only things I saw was a Tax bill for a 4 bedroom occupancy.  ",95,16,1468,288,0
Beach Recommendations - End of October,"Well, my fiancé and I were supposed to go to Clearwater Beach at the end of October, and sadly, I do not see that being the best choice at this point...

Cairns/Port Douglas vs. Auckland for last big trip from Australia,"My partner and I have lived in Australia a few years and are currently in Hobart. We plan to move back to North America in the next year and are deciding between two options for our final big (expensive) trip - The Great Barrier Reef or New Zealand. 

Due to timing and cost, we can only spend a week, so we’d be limited to just one of the islands in NZ. Timing is in the next two months, which I know isn’t great as we get into rainy season for QLD, but that’s what works for our schedules. I mentioned Aukland in the post title because our research shows that might be a better starting point, but welcome other thoughts. 

We primarily enjoy holidays for 1) trying new food and restaurants 2) experiencing nature and/or wildlife and 3) going to unique local activities, such as markets or boardwalks or something the area is known for. Here are our considerations:

- Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef is on my bucket list, but my partner gets extremely seasick so 5 minutes on a boat (regardless of meds) will make it a no-go for him. Not a deal breaker as we can have an afternoon with separate activities, but not ideal. 
- My partner is vegan (I am not, but often eat vegan at home or go to vegan restaurants), so it’s important that we can find good things to try wherever we go. We research extensively on Happy Cow and/or Google before we travel. 
- We love hiking and seeing beautiful nature, but are not looking for anything too intense (usually a 3-ish hour moderate hike by AllTrails standards is our go-to). 
- Glow worm caves sound absolutely amazing to me (as an alternate for my bucket list item) if I can do it in a boat, as I am claustrophobic and just watching videos of snorkeling or diving in a cave gives me anxiety. 
- We can fly direct from Hobart to Aukland in 3.5 hours but it takes double to get to Cairns (for the same price if not more) due to layovers. We don’t mind time spent driving (we have loved many road trips) but don’t enjoy time in airports. Again not a deal breaker, just something we weigh in our options. 

Really appreciate anyone’s opinion on which is the better option, along with suggestions like towns to make sure to include in the trip, favourite places or unique things to see, and vegan friendly restaurants to include while we’re there. ",65,10,2295,423,1

Renting Primary Residence when Moving across country,"So my fiancee and I own a home in South Fl. We purchased in 2022 with a rate of 3.6%  some stuff has come up m, she got a new job and we want to be back closer to family so we have relocated to the West and we are renting a house for atleast the first year. We are working with a property management company to rent our house but they just keep recommending we drop the price $100 each week. Doesn't feel like they're actively trying to get someone in. 

Overall, I think the home will rent for about $400/mo lower than our total mortgage and hoa fees. Our loan currently pays principal of 575-600/month. 

I'm torn because I like the house a lot, don't want to sell it, and there's the chance we could want to move back to FL if we don't like it out here. But then there's part of me that says just sell it.  Thoughts on renting for lower than mortgage while we figure out future life plans?  If we sell and decide to come back, we would probably not be able to afford to buy a similar home to what we had due to higher rates and appreciation. I know it's speculation, but part of me thinks I'll be kicking myself in 5-10 years if we sell it now",52,7,1146,230,0
2 month train loop of France,"Hi everyone, I am in the beginning stages of planning a 1-2 month trip around France next September entirely by rail. I’ve got a working idea of my path based upon France’s rail-network, and now I’m asking for feedback on my itinerary. Specifically, am I missing a wonderful destination that would be simple to include, or do I have duplicate stops that could be replaced with something new down the line?

I am an American male in my mid 20s, I have near fluent French, I’ll be travelling by myself, mainly staying in hostels because of price reasons as opposed to budget hotels. I’ve found that many French cities of a certain size lack hostels, and that could be a key reason why I’ve left them off my plan or demoted them to a day trip. I am interested in experiencing French culture across the country, food and beverage (wine!), architecture, and hiking. I am less interested in museums, art museums, and nightlife. 


Here is the itinerary, it’s also presented in map-form overlayed upon France’s rail-line:

1. Paris 

2. Nancy (day trip to Luxembourg)

3. Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar, could also spend a day in Colmar before continuing on as it’s en route)

4. Dijon (with day trips in the area)

5. First stop in Lyon

6. Annecy (with a day trip to Chambéry en route to next destination)

7. Grenoble

8. Back to Lyon

9. Marseille (Day trips in the area along the coast and to Aix. I am considering a detour to see Cannes, Nice, potentially Monaco, before heading straight back)

10. Montpellier

11. Toulouse

12. Bordeaux

13. Back to Paris before eventually flying home to the USA


I think my itinerary is heavily skewed towards Eastern/South Eastern France. Besides Bordeaux, I don’t have much going on in Western France. I’m thinking of adding a stop in La Rochelle and Tours. Is it worth travelling deep into Brittany as well? I’ve been to Rennes before. Is central France worth a visit? I could add Orléans on either at the beginning or end of my trip. Same with Lille and coastal northern France. That could even be extended into London, in which I fly out of London. Give me your advice. 

Also, how long should I be spending in places? I’ve got plenty of time available, I was thinking my longest stays would be in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseille. 

This is a lot, so thank you very much for reading it and any advice you have for me!",28,6,2366,407,1
Am I stupid to sell my house instead of renting it out? (3.25% rate) ,"Background: My wife and I are considering moving from Oregon to NJ to be closer to family. We are considering keeping our home in Oregon, managed by a property manager. The Oregon house neighborhood is amentity rich, in demand, and allows for an ADU to be build for additional rental income in the future. The primary home does not need to be owner occupied to have a rental ADU. Many of our friends in Oregon own rentals and have told us we would be fools to sell this home based on its location alone. 

Current house was purchased in 2020 for $312k, 20% down on a 30-year term mortgage. Current PITI is $1450. Current Redfin estimate is $410k, neighborhood comps also in that range. After fees and our $233k mortgage balance, it would be about $140k proceeds.

We would be moving to a higher COL area in NJ with houses in the
$675k range with $$ property taxes. We have cash on hand for a 20% down payment. 

Otherwise we sell, and our plan would be to put the full equity down on the new house, and have a lower loan amount.

My estimate for current home rents is about $1950 starting. Tenant protections are intense in our town bordering on predatory against landlords. We are concerned about increasing hostility toward landlords resulting in more intense tenant protections in the future. 

Our income will be $180k gross, and $300k in retirement accounts for context. We will also have 1 federal pension in retirement. 

Current home is older (1953). The home is in good physical condition with an updated kitchen, heating, water heater, newer roof. The home may need  gutters in a few years, but otherwise it’s a fairly simple 900 sqft cottage home. 

We do not have experience being landlords, especially remotely. We would be relying on a property manager. 

Curious to hear everyone thoughts on whether we should keep the home as a long term rental or just bail out, take the cash, and move on. For the experienced investors out there, would the financial benefits of future cash flows and equity appreciation justify the headaches of owning a rental property across the country? Thank you for your thoughts and opinions. ",69,15,2134,371,0

Late December trip suggestion ,"Hello everyone,

I’m planning my winter holidays and need some advices

contexte : I am a 30 French woman from Paris and I have some holidays from the 19th till the 1st of january 2025, I might extend them till the 13th as the 13th is my bday i want to be away for this. So its between the 19th till 13th January.  
i’ll travel solo and have a budget of \~2500. My non-négociable is : nothing COLD, for me winter holidays are to go as much as possible from the gloomy weather, a little break from the winter depression.  
i’m pretty chill and want to relax as I got tired really easy now lol but also I want to have the choice to go out if needed, I never shy to some good cocktails and some visiting ( museums, national parcs ). I don’t care that much about Christmas but love some NY vibes

My 3 top so far (flights less than 900€ and no too much of an hassle) :

Mexico : I’ve already solo trip to the Yucatán side before and loved it, this time will probably to add Mexico City as well of Oaxaca if possible

Hanoi : never been to Asia and I’m thinking might be time to go? If is easy to move around, is there any thing else besides Hanoi that I should look ?

USA : this one is a bit particularly as I think the city transportation might be tricky and a car renting might be necessary, so I was thinking mini road trip such as  Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and drive around but I’m not sure about the weather as I never drove in the USA or during different weather.  
the others option would be New Orleans as I heard begging January start the Mardis Gras festivities and then gravitates around, not sure what else to see ?

Sorry for the long post, I welcome all feedback/ suggestions. Any help welcome !

Thinking of selling my home to purchase a bigger one. ,"Hello I’m a (28M) that resides in the Phoenix area. I purchased a home during the pandemic on Oct. 2020. I purchased the home for 238k at a 2.8% interest rate. 

We have an opportunity to buy a bigger home for 390k from my in laws. The home is valued at 440k-500k. 

I was planning on selling my current home for around 350k minus fees and was planning on paying my car off that I owe 19k on then putting a 90k down payment on the new home and rolling whatever is left over to my (HYSA). 

We just got engaged and we are planning on having a kid very soon. We also have three dogs that we would like to provide a bigger backyard for. 

I guess what I am asking is, is it a good idea to purchase a new home with today’s interest rates? Should I rent out my current home instead? 

Expense are as follows:

Mortgage: $1327
HOA: $135 monthly
Car note: $445
Car insurance: $250
Phone Bill: $115
Other bills (groceries,gas,SRP,dog needs,city,internet) ~ $500-700~ depending on the month

Gross around $7500-8k a month 
Take home around $5300-5800k a month

Long term goal is to retire early around 50-55 with investments. I also plan on dollar cost averaging around 1k-2k every month in to the SP500 
 I guess my thought process is I can use the purchase of this home to eliminate debt and capitalize on the gains of the sell of this home since I am getting it under the valued price ",54,11,1465,270,0

Advice on a money issue,"My wife and I have decided that it's time to downsize before we retire.  We will take the equity from our home sale and pay cash for our new home.  We are also throwing around the idea of borrowing an additional $100,000 so we can get some features in our new home that we can't live without.

My dilemma is how to time it and what to do.  I've bought and sold homes before.  The difference is that an employer was paying for the move and helping out on the closing and new purchase.  This time, it's all on us.

I'll put my home up for sale but, I won't know when it will sell.  I really can't commit to buying a home until I have cash in hand.   Say, for example, we sell the house and close on November 1.  We will be out of our old home.  We will not have a new home yet because we need the proceeds from the old house to help pay for the new one.

Ideally, we will have a home picked out and will close within a month or so of our commitment.  However, we are also looking at new builds.  Builders are talking about 1 year to get in a new home.

Finally, to my question. What do I do for that time while waiting to close on our new home?  Do I have to put our stuff in storage and get an apartment temporarily? That scenario will be an extra expense.  Quite a large expense. Plus the wear and tear of moving my stuff twice.

Is there any way to get a temp loan so we can have the new home already purchased?  I know this is a risk because there is no guarantee when my current home will sell.  Also, making two payments each month could easily put us beyond our ability to pay.  Also, two water, gas, electricity, property tax, insurance payments for two homes will add up.

I'm hoping that the professionals on this sub can make some suggestions.

In case it matters, I'm hoping to sell my old house for about $850,000 and use the equity to buy about a $500,000 home with either cash or taking out the aforementioned $100 K loan.  We are in Texas and, in DFW.  We are looking to buy in the next town over, less than 10 miles, so at least moving expenses won't be super high. It seems like prices have not settled down.  I'm seeing houses in our range selling from around $180 Sq. Ft., to about $330. Sq Ft.  I know that there are lots of other factors that cause that difference.  I just thought I'd throw that in, in case it is a factor.

Possible Seller Credit Opinions ,"Coming to the pros of Reddit for their opinions on this matter, hoping to see if anyone else has had something similar.

In the midst of purchasing a home and under contract, everything is moving swiftly (knock on wood). Part of the acceptance of our offer was agreeing to the inspection being informational aside from any structural, environmental or hazardous issues. We were OK with this given the place was in good shape and we did not want to lose out. We understood the AC system was older, but figured it's OK since we do not want to lose the place by not agreeing. During inspection it was brought to attention that the AC coils and handler had no drain pan and were not up to code (located in attic above the master) nor mounted correctly. Also, there was some original fiberglass duct work still.

Given that the AC coils and handler are not installed properly and show signs of prior leakage with no drain pan we feel this presents a hazard which can also lead to structural issues. If the unit were to leak it could cause mold and significant drywall damage/caving. Is there a case to ask for some seller credit in this instance given the situation given how these issues were presented or not so much ? The condenser being original and needing replacement we understand and are not looking for credit there.

Rental Agency,"I’m a relatively new realtor, and so far, my main success has come from handling rentals. In my area, commissions are equivalent to one month’s rent, and with rent prices being quite high, the payouts have been pretty solid. Surprisingly, many agents tend to shy away from rentals, viewing them as less profitable or “less prestigious,” but in my experience, there’s a lot of untapped potential.

Given how well rentals have been working for me, I’m thinking of taking it further by launching a dedicated rental ""agency."" My plan is to build a website and position myself as a go-to resource for rental services, focusing on delivering a smooth, seamless experience for both property owners and renters. I’d handle everything from professional photography and managing listings to guiding renters through a streamlined application and viewing process. As the business grows, I envision bringing on a showing agent through a profit-share model.

I really enjoy the rental side of real estate—helping people find homes—and I feel this path differentiates me from being just another real estate agent in a market with very limited homes for sale.

How did you get started with finding properties to rent? Do you have any advice for breaking into this niche and expanding further?",13,2,1276,205,0

Q: Hurdling Non-Assumption of a Real Estate Loan - Parents getting divorced,"Hello, my brother and I are going through a difficult time and we are trying to find a fair deal for our parents as they are splitting up. I am seeking help to understand if there is any way to distribute real-estate properties (2 houses and a small multi-family unit) with pre-existing loans to another individual (my Mother) without refinancing the loan.

There was a proposal to move the properties in the name of a trust (me and my brother) to prevent capital gains tax on the properties and maintain a low interest rate as they were bought a long time ago. Still, there is worry from my father that he is going to have to stay on the loan, and if the houses default for any reason he is scared about hurting his credit. To circumvent that, a clause was proposed that he would be able to sell the property if me and my brother were 2 months late on mortgage payments. My mother doesn't agree with this as she does not want my father to have any more say in the house that would belong to her. Which I think is fair.

The plan is to have my mother live at 1 property that is valued slightly higher than the property of my father since he initiated the divorce and prefers the other house. My father would like to sell his house and move away from California. Sidenote: my father has cancer and is getting treated but, because of this, he is arguing for no alimony since he is not working at the moment. They sold their business because of the divorce and my mother has a small business.

Based on what I have gathered, the loans are all in my father's name but my mother is on the titles for all of the houses. The loans are non-assumable according to the loan companies which was a heavy blow when I heard but I am reading over the closing documents once they are delivered to me.

My question is: Is there any way to navigate this split without having to refinance the loan and give each their own property, loan, and all? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. We are working with two divorce lawyers on each side but this is a very complex task, or seems like it. Me and my brother just want the best for both of them and if they were to sell they would be in a much weaker position than they would be keeping the properties.

I really appreciate it. God Bless.",75,12,2270,425,0

The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

Edit: added an image showing the label on the hotel’s page.

Buyers Representation when viewing with a listing agent. PLEASE HELP!,"In light of the recent NAR settlement, I have started finding the listing agents of properties that my wife and I are interested in and setting up showings ourselves without a buyers agent. Many of the listing agents have requested us to start signing exclusive buyers representation agreements, most for just a day (or other short period of time) or just that property. The problem arises when we see multiple properties in a week and there are multiple agreements that may accidentally overlap. Are we required to show the listing agent our buyers agreement? Can we just say that we won't be touring with a buyers agent or that we will be self representing? Research on the bills themselves from the various government is hard to find a definitive answer and personally, I take NAR ""settlement 101 articles"" with a grain of salt.

For context, it isn't that I disagree with all commissions for buyers agents, but I generally disagree that it should be a flat percentage of the home as was traditional before the settlement. That seems to be the wrong incentive for me as a buyer. I've participated in half a dozen real estate transactions, so at this point, buying real estate doesn't necessarily intimidate me. Has anyone come across buyers agreements that incentivize the buyers agent to work down the price or monthly payment?

TL;DR - Do you need a buyers agent agreement to see a home with a listing agent? Can I say that we will be self representing and sign an affidavit saying as much.?

  
EDIT: I am specifically looking at properties in IL and IN, but often this claim I need a buyers agreement is because of a ""federal law""",69,10,1637,285,0
*Almost* bought my first home ,"Whooooweeee did I dodge a bullet. 

I had my heart set on this home, was absolutely determined to buy it no matter what hoops I had to jump through. I made it happen, put an offer in, and the seller ended up declining it even though it was the winning bid.

Why?

Because I had an FHA loan, and the other guys had conventional.

I was already a bit nervous about the septic, the listing agent swore up and down she “didn’t have any information on the septic”, but continued beating around the bush as to how “she just doesn’t think FHA will pass septic inspections” and “I could either back out or change to conventional”

I said fuck it, put my bid in with FHA, and got declined because “they don’t want to risk tests and losing the other buyer”

They accepted an offer almost $30,000 under mine.

Bummed I lost this house, but I’m starting to see maybe it was for the best, as I’m really not trying to replace a septic in the event it was screwed.",30,6,949,174,0

Do signatures update in real time on dotloop?," I am not familiar with e signing and hope someone will help me understand how this works. If a buyer of a home shows as not having signed a document on dotloop does it update when they do? My brother's realtor took his home off the market listing's after he signed a purchase offer. It had been a week and his realtor sent him a disclosure doc to sign which wasn't a big deal. He noticed the buyer hadn't signed. His realtor seems to know the buyer as she's a retired realtor and there seems to be catering towards the buyer being done on his realtors part.
  There was a 5k deposit in earnest money made but if she pulls her offer and hasn't signed that last document is she off the hook? He is already in progress of buying another woman's home who just placed hers as pending so it's really concerning.
  Should he ask his realtor if the buyer has signed all of the contract and if she hasn't to re list his house? Or not rock the boat?
  There's a lot on the line and hes stressed. I'm guessing dotloop just showed the buyer hadn't signed yet at that time but being that it was a week later wouldn't a serious buyer have signed them all especially a former realtor? His realtor had ""forgot"" to send the last document, could happen but shes a seasoned realtor. He had specifically requested his house be listed as contingent on him finding another house. The realtor never put that in the listing and it wasn't in the contract, he had to ask her to put it in and she put in contingent on a loan. He ended up getting an offer on a house accepted so he didn't push it. Just for more clarity on how things have been going, he feels the realtor isn't looking out for him.

3.5 weeks in Spain - any tips?,"Want to go to Spain next year in late September. Once I get it in my head to go somewhere, I need to plan it out on paper so I can stop obsessing over the dates 😆

Thinking we could do something like this...

Option 1:
- Arrive in Barcelona on 19 September - 6 nights 
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 1 night (breaking up the N to S journey)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 3 nights
- Fly home (13 October)

OR

Option 2:
- Arrive in Madrid on 11 September - 1 night to settle in
- San Sebastian - 4 nights 
- Madrid - 3 nights 
- Barcelona - 6 nights (quicker trip same day rather than having to arrive the night before directly from San Sebastian and lose a night there)
- Seville - 4 nights 
- Cordoba - 2 nights
- Granada - 4 nights
- Madrid - 1 night
- Fly home (6 October)

All domestic travel by train. 

I can only fly in and out of Madrid or Barcelona from home and the 6 nights in Barcelona can't be moved or shortened as we gotta be there then. But I could swap the 3 nights in Madrid to the middle between San Sebastian and Seville and do the one night at the end before flying home in Option 1. I thought it might feel a bit more relaxing though to have the 3 nights at the end. 

Keen for some feedback on these itineraries and if I'm giving too much or too little time in certain cities.

Fallout from 2019 foreclosure,"My dad (53) is in the midst of the fallout from a foreclosure in California in 2019.  In 2017 My dad was in a bad place mentally and emotionally and walked away from his job, family and house.  He moved across the country and stopped paying his first mortgage. His HELOC was on auto pay on a savings account he rarely used and he just forgot about. 

My dad did not leave a forwarding address and just completely ignored the entire situation.  He never received or was served with any of the foreclosure documents which is entirely on him. In 2019 and the home was foreclosed upon.  From the i have done online the house sold at auction for more then the total of his first and HELOC. 

Fast forward to now. My dad got the treatment he needed and has spent the past few years rebuilding his life. He moved back to California, rebuilt his family and friend relationship and secured a good job. He decided to buy a house again and qualified for an FHA loan given that the foreclosure was more than three years ago. He also rebuilt his credit and saved for a down payment.  He worked with a mortgage broker and was conditionally qualified for the loan. 

This is where the problems started. He pulled his consumer credit reports and all three showed the HELOC as closed but there was an oddity. The HELOC had continued to auto draw the payments until March 2023 when the payments stopped.  When the broker pulled his credit the supplements showed different information. The supplements showed the account open and a balance due. 

Confused between the differences on his consumer report showing closed and the supplements showing open he called the HELOC service and figured he could resolve this easily. Not the case. The HELOC service had purged the loan from their system since their policy is to purge after an account has no payments for 14 months. 

The customer service agent looked into what information they could find in the purged account system and what they could find is that there was no status on whether the account was open or closed, no balance or disposition status. Just that it wasn’t in their system.  The agent opened a ticket and requested an account p payment/transaction history report and he received it this morning.  The report shows that no balance is for and it shows that the principle was paid off in April 2023. The problem is it doesn’t show who or how the balance was paid out whether the loan was sold/ m transferred. It just shows that he does not have a balance with them which contradicts what was reported on the credit supplements. The only odd this I noticed was the principle payoff was one cent less than the amount owed. 

I was in the phone with him and the HELOC services as he is supposed to close in ten days and this is the only hold up with underwriting.  He sent in a request to their research department to explain and clear up the issues and was told that will take up to 30 days        Likely he won’t be able to get this resolved in time and will not be able to close on this loan. 

So now my questions:

1)Since he didn’t payoff the loan how else would it show as principle paid?

If the loan was sold or transferred I would reasonably expect the new creditor would show up in his credit report especially after not making payments for nearly eighteen months. 

2) Since this was a foreclosure was the HELOC allowed to continue to collect payments after the December 2019 foreclose through March 2023?

3) Is it possible the loan principle was paid via a charge off?  Nothing in the payment history indicates that. 

4) Is there even a concept that some type of insurance the lender had  paid off the loan?  I don’t know if that is a thing.

5 Any other advice you can recommend?

I know this is long yet it is a very confusing situation.

When looking at itineraries they all seem to be around driving out and then back to san pedro every day. Just wondering if anybody did anything different with lodges, airbnbs etc in different areas to complete more of a loop? (if it's a couple of nights in San Pedro due to logistics that'd be fine as well)

National MLS Time? ,"Does anyone out there think that a national mls and national forms will come out of all the miscommunication in the industry to streamline it? 

I’m just curious what others think. What do you think would be good about no local MLS’s and a national one? What do you think would be bad about it? Do you think it would help the public or hurt the public? 

Same with national forms, contracts, etc. Do you think those would help promote transparency or hinder it? 

Are your local boards helpful or wasteful? Are your state forms worse than other states or better? Do you think if the states that triggered the lawsuit had more transparent contracts like other states that the lawsuit may have never happened? 

I’m just curious. On one hand, I think one national mls would be great and on another, I think we would still need local parties to communicate up the chain to them on our behalf. 

As far as national forms and contracts go, I think it could be great and it could be not so great. The opinions of others will help me decide.

Carrier options for international flight 😵‍💫,"Hi:) I am booking a flight to visit my partner who recently moved to do a fellowship in Spain. There are several flights with comprable prices, but the two airlines I’m coming up with are Air Europa and Swiss. It’ll be just a bit more, ~$50 to take Swiss. My partner took the air Europa flight from JFK - MAD - ALC and had a fine time on it, no complaints and recommended I do the same. There’s flights of same price-ish point with Iberia, Brussels Airlines, and British Airways also. Which is best, price point aside - for customer service, etc? I’m not opposed to having an uncomfortable seat but have been in situations in the past with domestic travel, ie United and Spirit, where problems occurred without any help or assistance. Thanks much:) ",44,6,749,136,1
Would you buy if there’s l documented leaks (exhaust fans)? ,"We’ve done a general inspection and a roof inspection and neither had any major issues. However, Seller disclosed that there have been a few times during rain where the both of the upstairs bathrooms exhaust fans were leaking water. The seller didn’t take any action to fix it. The roofing inspection didn’t find anything indicating a roof leak, but no one can tell me the reason for the exhaust fan leak. I live in SoCal and it hasn’t really rained months, but I don’t want this to be an issue the next time we get major rain this winter.

Would you buy or walk?

Question About Getting Involved as an Agent in a DR Horton New Build Deal,"I’m currently in the process of renewing my real estate license after it expired 7 months ago, and I’m completing the 98 hours of SAE required to get it active again. I’ve been helping someone close to me, who’s a foreigner, navigate a DR Horton new build purchase by translating and breaking down the contract since they’re not familiar with the process.

Initially, I didn’t think about trying to get involved as the buyer’s agent because I wasn’t sure how long the renewal process would take. But after doing some research, I realized it’s only 98 hours of SAE, which seems pretty doable.

Here’s the situation: the buyer was originally registered by an agent who showed them one house. Later, I came back on my own to video another house, which is the one we’ve ended up submitting an offer on. Earnest money has been deposited (it’s only been 3 days), and we’re waiting on financing approval. However, the buyer’s rep agreement hasn’t been signed yet.

The builder’s sales agent says it’s not possible to get involved as the buyer’s agent because the original agent’s name is down as the one who introduced them to the property, even though they were only there for the first house. The house we’re offering on was essentially found by us separately.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or know if there’s any way to step in as the buyer’s agent once my license is renewed, especially since the buyer’s rep agreement hasn’t been signed? I’ve basically done all the work—finding the house, breaking down the contract, and handling communication. The current agent is just collecting an easy commission. Any advice or insights would be really appreciated!

When should I leave my job to start travelling?,"I (23f) graduated in May and have been working at this company since July but I haven't enjoyed it since day 1 and have put off quitting this whole time. I've been wanting to travel for years but never had the courage to pull the trigger and do it until now.

Now I'm just torn between leaving my job in December (when I'll be done with all my projects/don't have any commitments to new ones yet and I'll be less established at my company) and February (when I'll have saved up more money, have a few more months to put on my resume, and can spend the holidays with family). I'm also undergoing the clearance process and I don't really understand how it works but it'd probably be best to stop it sooner rather than later if that's possible?

I would still have 30k saved up if I left in December and it would be nice to leave earlier, but there's also a strong argument for pushing off leaving until February. Any advice??",47,9,923,171,1

"A week's long trip to Iceland, September 2024","For a while now I wanted to go to Iceland, and finally did it last month, and I have enjoyed it so much!

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much).

"Barcelona, Seville &amp; Lisbon with 4 month old in November ","
Hi everyone!

Me (29F), my husband (30M)  are headed to Spain and Portugal with our daughter(4 months) in November (approx Nov 9-18 depending on flights). Though I know Spain and Portugal could easily be over 2 months each, we are hoping to do both in the 9-10 days we have, spending just a few days in each city we stop. 

I have searched through google and various threads for ideas and inspiration, but keep running in circles, especially re: ensuring activities and itinerary is baby safe. 

Few notes before I get into the itinerary and questions: 
- we are trying to keep the number of cities to a minimum, this way we have adequate time in each and don’t have to subject baby to too much extra travel
- Not sure if we should do Seville or Granada (or both?)
- We chose Barcelona and Lisbon as our entry and exit countries as they are significantly cheaper for us to fly in and out of.  That said we are open to switching to starting with Lisbon and ending with Barcelona if that’s better.  Willing to shorten time in Barcelona to lengthen time in Seville/Granada
- We greatly prefer culture experiences over general touristy things. Similarly, though we’d love to look at a museum or two, after awhile they all start to look very similar, so would like to keep the general sightseeing of museums and similar things to a minimum
- We would really like to do at least one wine tasting likely near Barcelona. 
- Prefer small tour groups (private or semi-private), and may not be bringing a car seat, so will need to either have a company provide one or not need it 
- baby is breast-feeding, but will take a bottle. I will bring my pumps this way I can enjoy the occasional glass of wine, especially on the winery tour. Will need to pick up more diapers and wipes along the way though
- We also want to try to dip our toes in as many oceans/seas as we can :)

With that out of the way, our current itinerary looks as follows. Please let me know what you think for things to do in each area if we should change and add another city between Barcelona and Seville, and hotel recommendations or places to avoid. Also open to any suggestion suggestions for bringing 4 month old to each of these cities and travelling in general. Thanks in advance!

days 1-3 - Barcelona
- Hoping to do a day tour up to Montserrat for a wine tour
- Would like to dip our toes in the Balearic sea (swimming not required or expected given it’s winter)

Day 3 or 4: train from Barcelona to Seville or Granada

Days 4-7: Seville or Granada
- Maybe a cooking class?
- Would like to dip our toes in the Alboran sea if possible

Day 7 or 8: travel to Lisbon

Days 8-10: Lisbon
- maybe a wine tour or ceramic tile class

First time homebuyer - Inspection Comcessions,"After 7 months of looking for a home in Illinois I finally had an offer accepted. This home is 60 years old so of course I expected some upgrades and improvements needed, however our inspection came back with a laundry list of items and I am not sure how reasonable these things are to 1) Pay for myself and deal with it 2) ask seller to repair or provide seller credits for. I am assuming the deal with fail or will be a combination of 1 and 2. 

Roofing - water damage and elevated moisture levels suggest an active leak, this is a newer roof and the leak seems confined to one area of home. Additionally like stack flashings were installed incorrectly and need to be remedied. 

Electrical- Several GFCI receptacles are faulty
and incorrect breaker is incorrect for the air compressor (25 max amps) and 40 amp breaker is installed on main breaker. Additionally a water heater is using an extension cord where it should be permanent wiring. 

Plumbing-A leak in one bathroom in drain pipes at fittings / joints at sink. 

A toilet needs to be replaced due to recalled flushing mechanism (if I am being honest had plans to renovate this bathroom entirely so not a major concern) not the same bathroom as leak in sink! 

Dryer-Brass Gas Connector is a fire hazard and should be replaced with stainless steel

Rotted Window Sash in main living room window. 

There are other more minor issues as well. My major concern is plumbing electrical and roof.

Selling a home within less than two years,"I recently bought a home (single, M29) and originally thought of staying in the home for at least 2 years before trying to sell it. One of the main reasons I bought this home was to be close to work (10 min commute vs 50 min commute). If I end up leaving my job or cutting down on my hours, then I wouldn’t really need to be at this house. But say I do decide to sell at the 1 year mark or anywhere between 2 years, can you please tell me what I would lose? 

I was really hoping someone could break it down for me, because this is my first time ever buying a home and then would be my first time selling. I know that i’d have to pay capital gains taxes, but how much is that and what exactly would I be earning (if any) or losing? Would I just have to price the home for more to gain a profit? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Mom traveling alone with 1 year old,"I’m needing some help deciding if I should check luggage. 

For context: I’m a fairly experienced and highly organized traveler (on my own), but I am traveling Delta SLC&gt;DTW&gt;SYR New York for the first time alone with my nearly-12-month-old right after Thanksgiving this year. It’s just me and her for all the flights. I have us booked for the middle and window seat for each flight. She will sit in her car seat in the window seat to give as much respect to the aisle seat passenger having to sit next to a baby. She can take a nap or play in her car seat when needed. 

I hate to check luggage. Here are the cons I can think of for this trip: It usually costs money, can get our luggage lost, and takes extra time to pick up after landing. Our flight to Syracuse gets in around 11pm and I have to also pick up our rental car before midnight. 

Pros of carrying on luggage: It will be free for us to bring two roller bags and 2 backpacks which is all we will need. I should be able to board earlier than most other passengers and have space for the roller bags in the overhead bins. They will gate check our stroller and she will sit in her carseat which is a bucket seat that easily attaches to her stroller. I can use one of those luggage attachment buckles to carry all these things through TSA and the airport. 
But the cons are: Getting the carseat, 2 backpacks, 2 roller bags, and the baby into our seats. 

I guess I’m looking for affirmations or refutations about me having the ability to get all the pictured luggage onto the plane by myself. I don’t worry too much about the strength to do it. But I am worried about the time it will take and how inconvenient it will be for me, other passengers, and flight personnel—even if I board early. She’s a great baby and has done well on planes, so I’m not worried about her behavior. Plus look how cute she is!

Help Me Choose Between Two Homes – Need Opinions!,"Hey Reddit, I’m torn between two homes and could really use some advice from those who have been through similar decisions! Both homes are in the same general area (North Texas) and are relatively close to the same highway for commuting. Here are the main details:

**Option 1:**

* Priced at $608k
* 4 bed, 3.5 bath, with a study and media room
* 9 ft ceilings throughout, but a 2-story high ceiling in the living room
* Large, private backyard with no rear neighbors
* Lower interest rate at 4.875%
* Feels more traditional in design

**Option 2:**

* Priced at $625k
* 4 bed, 3 bath, with a study and media room
* 10 ft ceilings throughout the main floor, and modern high-end finishes (like 8 ft doors, modern staircase, etc.) and sloped ceiling in living room.
* Slightly smaller backyard, and the lot is sloped
* Slightly bigger home by 50 sq ft
* Higher interest rate at 5.5%
* Closer to higher-end homes in the community, with a more contemporary design
* Additional bedroom downstairs

**Key Points:**

* Option 1 has a more private backyard and a lower interest rate, but ceilings are 9 ft (except the living room).
* Option 2 has higher ceilings and more modern finishes but comes with a higher price and interest rate. The lot is sloped, but it’s in a slightly more premium neighborhood.

I’m leaning one way but also feeling a bit of buyer’s remorse on the ceilings and finishes. Which option would you pick and why? How much would 10 ft ceilings and modern design matter to you compared to things like a private backyard and a better rate?

Charging US Phones in a Country with 220V Electricity Supply,"I have heard some contradicting opinions. Hoping to get a more clear answer here.

I am travelling to a region where the electricity supply is 220V.

I have a Samsung Galaxy phone. The OEM phone charger is dual voltage 100V - 240V. So no problem there. All I need is a suitable plug adapter so I can plug the OEM charger in their wall socket. 

Then I find a plug adapter on Amazon that has also a built-in USB port in additional to the regular US receptacles. The seller makes it very clear that this is just a plug adapter but not a voltage converter. 

Some people say because the adapter doesn't convert the voltage from 220V to 110V, I should plug your phone into the OEM phone charger (which take either voltage) and then plug the OEM phone charger into the wall socket via the plug adapter.

However, other people say you can skip the OEM phone charger and plug the phone directly into the USB ports using just the USB cord. They claim that even though the adapter isn't a voltage converter but the USB port will only output 5V, so the phone is safe.

Who is correct? Any real life experience?

I can either cut my holiday short by a day that would mean I can travel back before the '6 month expiry period' or if the rule doesn't apply on leaving dubai then I might be okay. I won't know until I get to the airport and will have to take that chance. If I cannot travel due to this then I'm uncertain if my travel insurance would cover me for this as it would be my responsibility to know before booking.

The expedia website didn't ask for passport information assuming all was okay until I tried to checking in on BA website, although 
I was able to check on, it wouldn't allow me to print my boarding pass.  The only way it worked was by cutting it down by 1-day (which is the date of expiry (6 months before expiry - 14th April 2025)

I'm due to fly out tonight (7th October), if anyone can offer advice urgently before travelling to the airport for my flight at 10pm then that would be very much appreciated. Many thanks in advance!",233,45,1167,221,1

Fixer upper disaster?,"I’ve been looking for homes, since ya know, rents the same as a mortgage 🤪 we have seen probably 12 houses so far but fell in love with one. It’s an executor sale because the poor man passed, his nephew is selling the home as he’s the only relative in the states able to do so. The house is gorgeous! But wasn’t maintained well. We put an offer for 275k when it was listed at 385k because of how much work needs done! The seller was going to agree, but the agent pushed him not to. They countered with 360k with only up to 2500 back after inspection and for us to fix all CO violations to gain occupancy. We countered back with the same offer stating why (total bathroom gut and potential floor joist replacement as from the powder room from below that bathroom showed water damage. So we moved the ceiling tile and found rotted floor joists from water damage), the basement floods because the windows arent fitted properly, the floor is uneven due to settling and there is a condemned pool on the property which they aren’t sure who’s land it’s on because his other uncle who passed too who lived next door. Just to name a few).The house has great charm, lots of potential but isn’t worth the money of listing. We’ve been watching them decrease the value every 2 weeks because no one is interested… now it’s down to 329k so we put an offer of good faith at 285k (knowing well enough it’s not worth it). They countered again at their price and stated the contract would be a locked in contract that we can’t escape and they requested we waive inspection, which at 26 I’m not willing to screw myself over with. We countered same price with inspection for big ticket items and agreed for SOME CO. They told us they’d keep us in mind.. they aren’t too far off from the offer we listed with decreasing value every 2 weeks. Is this just not worth my hassle anymore? should I hold out hoping it will come in my favor? Running out of options as where I live have very few in our price range. Had it been turn key I’d be more than happy to pay its worth, but this is not anywhere close to its worth…",21,3,2091,395,0
First house is a Nightmare that's destroying my life,"Update: I've added more detail on comment about what I've done to fix the problem below. 
In April I bought my first house in NC and I still haven't moved in. The first floor of the house apparently smells like pet urine. I have spent the last 5 months ripping out flooring, painting with odor blocking primer, getting contractors to look, and more. It still smells. 

This wasn't even the problem I was focused on when I bought the place! During instruction, I was under the impression the house was musty because it had been vacant for a little while. Turns out it had been a rental for the past 15 years!

Somehow I was convinced to by this nightmare house by a real estate agent that played the gentle giant part perfectly. Looking back on it, he pressured me into using his inspector by making the inspection time frame only a week. I couldn't get my own inspector in time. Then his guy seemed to focus on random small stuff the entire time. No mention of hey you'll never be able to get the stink out of the concrete. 

The inspector even tricked me about the ac units. The upstairs heat pump unit is newer (2019) and can't even hold temperature of the upstairs to 72 if it's 80 degrees outside. I asked him if he's sure it's working, and he said yes the temperature differential is within range. Yet the downstairs unit from the 80s works just fine! But the inspector stated the downstairs ac unit temperature differential is 2 degrees out of range. 

I'll never forget what the real estate agent told me just a minute after closing. He said ""You'll find out, how much of a DIY-er you are with this house"". At the time I didn't think anything of it. Now, I feel like it was an admission of knowing what a nightmare he just sold to me.

At this point I feel so helpless because this house I got convinced to overpay for is going to financially ruin me. I haven't had a free weekend in months. And I feel like I can't free myself from this nightmare. It's taken over my life.



[Update:]

I posted a detailed description on what I've down downstairs so far. I would love it if you could give me pointers on it. I'll paste it again here for you: thanks! 

Pee Odor Elimination: Everyone has been suggesting a lot of the helpful things I have been reading up on over the months. At this point I feel like I've tried them all. That's where all my money has been going. Buying new products and tools to fix this. I would like to go into more detail to see if anyone can spot some things I haven't considered yet:

First thing I did was remove all of the carpets, padding and tack strips, from the first floor. Visitors had highlighted one of the 3 carpeted rooms in particular as a dog having peed there. 

I hit it with a multitude of enzyme cleaners after using TSP to open the pores. I used dish soap, odoban, Rocco and Roxie, and nature's miracle and brushed them in with a hard bristled brush. Following the general consensus the Internet has for this issue. The result was that there still is a strong odor. (I remember it being just as strong as before) But the smell itself seemed to change to that of a more chemical smell to me.

Next I hit that same room's concrete floor with 2 coats of Zinsser bin (a kilz alternative that people say is likely better and very $$$) and the walls with 1 coat as well. Still the smell persists.

I moved on to the next of the 3 carpeted rooms which is the living room. Currently, this is where the smell is the strongest and where Im focusing! I painted the walls and floor with 1 coat of Zinsser bin. As well as the hallway that connects these 2 rooms. I don't think I treated this part with enzyme cleaners. 

Also ran an ozone machine for an hour with fans to spread it around the first floor. I plan on doing more treatments for longer as well. 

[Big question here] was it a big mistake to only paint this room? Should I grind off the Zinsser bin coat to enzyme treat and then repaint? Or should I be fine? My current thought was to apply another coat of kilz this time because it's oil based and run the ozone machine. Then I will likely move on to the kitchen and the third room which don't smell as bad to me.

Where to go for the final leg of my trip?,"I've got an 8 week sabbatical planned and leave on the 3rd October. 

I'm heading to Colombia, Peru and then Bolivia. I'll have around 2 weeks left to explore another country and I'm really undecided on what to do.

However I've also been looking at Nicaragua or Guatemala and Costa Rica. Where would be best to go for the middle of Nov?

"Sixt Rental Car in Germany; Charges for clutch damage, now gearbox damage.","On August 4th of this year I rented a car through Sixt. The rental was from the 4th to the 8th with a pickup in Cologne, Germany, and drop off in Salzburg Austria. I am an experienced driver from the US with a manual car at home, and many years experience riding motorcycles. I know my way around a manual transmission, at least enough to not blow it in 300KM. I’m sure you can see where this is going…

I paid for the rental via my Visa credit card, and as I researched online it seems Germany and Austria are covered through Visa’s rental insurance terms. Part of this coverage is noted to require no purchase of additional coverage, so I declined all Sixt insurance coverages, and am relying on Visa to cover any damages. At this time, I don’t believe ANY damages are due to my own fault.

On August 5th, just 250-300km into my journey, the shifter on the rental car stopped letting me go from 2nd gear to any other gear. It would only move forward/back, with no resistance… This meant I was stuck in 2nd gear, but the clutch still worked such that I could come to a stop, hold the clutch in, and it wouldn’t stall. This gave me enough power to get to the nearest Sixt from where I was at, only maybe 5km away. Rather than be broken down waiting for a tow in a country I barely speak the native language, I got the car stuck in 2nd gear the 10 minute drive to the location.

Sixt took the car in, and sent me on my way with an automatic version of the same car essentially. This was turned in per the agreement on August 8th without any issues.

On September 27th I got an email from Sixt that “detected the following problem with my rental vehicle”. The detected problem was stated as “Clutch failure”. This email included a form to fill out, in which I stated that while in Heidelberg the car got stuck in 2nd gear. I requested that I be informed of any pending charges, and stated this was not my fault as clutches are normal wear and tear items, and couldn’t possibly have been worn out in my journey on just my driving alone, likely this was abused by someone before me. I sent this in on the 29th.

Today, Sixt emailed back stating they still are reviewing this, and they now state the gearbox was damaged due to driving without use of the clutch during shifting. They also curiously noted that this is “not covered under warranty”. This, I am completely certain is not my fault now, as I know without a doubt I used the clutch to shift.

My key question is: I anticipate a battle here between myself and Sixt through my credit card company. They have not charged me any funds yet to the credit card I used when I rented the car, but I fully expect it to be coming. I have warned my financial institution, and requested any charges from Sixt be challenged. They stated they made a note of this on my account, but I’m not totally satisfied. Am I supposed to just wait until they charge me, then create a chargeback or should I change my card number to avoid charges being made on my account? ",74,12,3000,561,1

Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",24,4,2111,351,1

Anxious tenant here: if our property manager wants our rental appraised could it be bad for us?,"Rental tenant in Oregon here. We got a text saying that someone was coming by to appraise the property soon, my roommates and I are anxious about what that could potentially mean for us.



We can't find a whole lot of information about this online from the perspective of tenants, mostly from the perspective of property owners. So I thought I would ask you all what it could mean for tenants in your experience.

  
For the record we have no intention of denying the appraiser access. Our anxiety is that the property manager wants the house appraised so that they can sell it and potentially evict us. We've been living at the property for about 5 years and always pay our rent so I don't believe we meet the criteria that would allow them to evict us without cause. But then again we're not exactly lawyers so we don't know how this works. 

  
We tried asking our property managers about this but they were sort of cagey about it, said ""they have no more information available at this time."" Which made us way more worried than we were originally. 

  
So in your experience are there scenarios where this could lead to us being evicted? Are there benign scenarios? ",95,17,1171,213,0

Per Diem delay,"I’m currently under contract to close on a new construction home in NC on Sept 26th with an all cash offer. The buyer of my buyer had an underwriting issue and had to switch lenders and needs an extension. They are now saying it will be by Oct 7 at the latest before we can close on our current home in OH and have the funds needed to close in NC. 

Upon hearing that news my buying agent down in NC made it seem like a huge deal and said there were per diem fees involved for any delay. I reread our offer to purchase and addendums again and found nothing referring to per diem. I’ll also note that due to a vacation with someone working for the builder they never sent me instructions on where to send builder deposit so I never sent it. 

My agent reached out to the builders agent and confirmed that there was a per diem fee of $200 per day until we close. Once they heard about the delay and realized I never sent the builder deposit they were very pushy about me sending the 5k builders deposit that was overlooked immediately. I am concerned that this 5k is the only piece of leverage that I have to prevent the per diem fee. 

Should I threaten to cancel the contract and put a stop cancel on my check that’s in the mail if they don’t remove the threat of per diem fees? Do they have any legal action they can take against me for cancelling the contract?

I have already wired 115k to the escrow attorney but as I understand that can be wired back to me whenever. 

I really like this house and don’t want to have to cancel the contract but I feel backed into a corner here. If we have to end up waiting until Oct 7th to close it will cost us over 2,500 in per diem fees and U-Haul extensions. 

If we have to end up cancelling we will find another quick move in new build and hopefully be able to close by the 7th still since we have a cash offer.

Hotel / Resort fees getting out of control?,"
Stayed in an Orlando hotel last week after scouring the website for resort fees and parking fees and such.  This one charged me an extra $7 per night to use the safe and it was not optional.  It seems like coercion to me especially when you prepay for the room then get hit with extra charges when checking in.  They know that once you are there that you won't be able to easily ""just go somewhere else.""

The other one I'm seeing more of is parking fees.  They try to lure you in with a low nightly price, only to find there is a $40 per night parking fee.  In big cities where parking is scarce, it makes sense sometimes to need to park in a garage that is sometimes blocks away and pay extra, but in a standard hotel with outdoor parking lot paying extra seems like a scam.

Suggestion for buyer under the new commission structure ,"I was not familiar with the new commission structure and signed a one year contract with my agent. The contract requires me to ensure her getting 3% so I have to pay the difference when the seller pay less than 3%. Not only I felt like I signed a really bad deal but I felt she is just terrible. She always suggests me to bid on top of the list prices on every single house that I asked for suggestions. Most of the houses that we looked at either sell at list price or below list price. I think she is either really bad on estimating the market or just wants me to overpay so she gets paid.

I am not sure if I can get out of the contract. If not, I will just wait till it expires. After the contract expires, Is it smart to explore buying without agent or work with an agent that doesn’t demand the full 3%?

Land Locked House issue,"
Hello, I bought a house 2 years ago back in 2022. It’s a land locked house with no ingress or egress due to a section of state land at the beginning of the private rd with no easement in place.

Is it smart to get a standalone HELOC to renovate my mother's house?,"Hoping to get some input if this makes sense. I was previously planning to buy my own home and realized how competitive the market is and the interest rate is just too high for my liking and I hate overpaying, lol. I came up with the idea with my partner and my mother to what if I take over the house by without having to sign over the mortgage to me and just take maybe a $100k HELOC loan for renovations with a 30 years term in hopes to pay more along the way and pay off earlier. The house is in good condition and this is merely for aesthetic purposes which is why I want a $100k renovation. I would pay the mortgage even though it's under her name then maybe after 5 years, sign it over to me. I have a 785 credit score and do make $100k a year with some student loans and car loan debt with a monthly expense total of $1000 (varies based on my credit card use so without it would be $800 - this includes car insurance. Other misc maybe about $500). My partner (makes about $40k a year with a monthly car payment of $500 - I don't want him to cosign as he doesn't have a good credit score) and mother would still help with expenses so I have no issue preventing myself living paycheck to paycheck. I currently rent so after my lease ends, we would go back to my mother's. We have lived with her before so it's no issue there - she lives alone. Is this possible if I have no mortgage?

Home advice ,"Hello All, long story short, my self and 2 friends started investing in real estate and bought a home together about 4 years ago. Myself and friend 1 both have our names on the mortgage loan but all 3 of us are on the deed. We wanted to only put 1 of us on the loan but I had to hop on it because of my credit score. 

About a 3 years into the property my girlfriend and I got more serious, moved out into our own home (renting) and we want to buy our own house soon. My friends still live there and pay all the bills. However, the home still shows up on my DTI so I’m finding it near impossible to get approved for another mortgage loan. We’ve looked into the assumption process but it was pretty expensive. And we cannot refinance the loan to get me off of it due to the climb in insurance rates.

Me (F23) and my parents (\~60) are looking to go on a trip for the holidays \~Dec 23-Jan 1 and are really curious about Tbilisi/surrounding areas. Thank you for reading over this slightly long post as I would love to hear from locals/people who have visited before. Would love some pretty honest/frank responses if it isn't a good idea to visit, for whatever reason.

* I haven't really seen a lot online about East Asians visiting Tbilisi, so was wondering if there's any air of hostility towards visitors who are Chinese. We've experienced and are used to all kinds of (both good and bad) hospitality in Europe over the years since we travel quite a bit and understand that people can be harmlessly curious/ignorant, so we never take it personally - just genuinely curious what the vibe is like YKWIM, pardon my rudimentary question!
* Is late December a good time to visit? I've done research on Youtube/online (https://georgia.travel/ and more) about Tbilisi but most of what I've found is in the summer/warmer parts of the year. We don't ski/do Winter sports so that's out of the question—we would definitely be interested in wine tours, cultural sightseeing (big museum family), and natural sights. Also, my parents are hoping to catch some holiday festivities, I understand Orthodox Christmas is on Jan 7 so hoping that things will be open and that we can see some markets or events- businesses won't be closed until starting the first week of January right?
* What is your favorite thing to do in the Winter in Tbilisi? Any local tour recommendations?
* Is it worth going to any of the following surrounding areas (/which one is your favorite) and staying near there for a few days since we are considering \~a week or a bit more in Georgia? Should we book/rent a car, and any rental company recommendations? I've been recommended: Mtskheta, Jvari, Uflitsikhe, Alazani Valley, Sighnaghi, Bodbe, Borjomi, Kazbegi
* Would you recommend staying in a hotel/Airbnb? Any recommendations for better areas of the city to stay in as a tourist?

My friend from Kazakhstan recommended Tbilisi since she recently visited and loved it. I always want to be respectful of the people of the city I'm visiting so wanted to ask here about recommendations and if tourists are welcome this time of year. We only speak English (and Chinese but obviously won't be helpful in Georgia!)

Thanks in advance and blessings!",72,17,2408,402,1
how much money are you required to have to go from germany to the US?,"So I am very confused. I have never left the US, and have only been to four states here, so I don't know much about travel or anything surrounding it. 

My boyfriend lives in Germany, and is going to be coming here to see me for a few months. I'm pretty sure I understand the passport and Visa stuff, although it's a little confusing to me (thankfully he has traveled to multiple countries, including the US, so he knows). 

The thing Im really worried about though is the money thing. I've just read somewhere that you basically have to provide proof of money for your hotel, food, gas, car rentals, whatever. You get the jist. Well, neither of us are rich by any means. He has money, but not enough to cover all of that, but that's realistically fine because he's going to be staying with me. 

He'll be staying here, I'll be providing food, I have my car, etc. (He's going to be helping me pay for some of those things when he's here, as he already does sometimes even when he's not) But can he just tell them that he's going to be staying with me and that's okay? 

Like he won't have the money for that. I've read that it has to be like 10,000 euros or US dollars or something. Like wtf? Neither of us have that, that's actually wild. 

I'm so so confused and being confused gives me anxiety lol. 

Also, he's been talking about something for getting a card or something for money when he's here? But he just goes too fast and too into detail for me to follow along sometimes lol. But how will he have money when he's here? Do German cards and stuff work in America? Probably not right?

Neighbor trying to take communal area.,"I am one of 5 units built on the same lot.

In the listings for all units it says we have a communal green space. We have in writing from the sellers when we purchased the property via buyer agent (no hoa). That we would form a communal agreement for what to put in the greenspace and other items. Now a new buyer has tried to close off the access to the communal area with a lock, which is hilarious, and this is somewhat rhetorical but being as they think this is for themselves (even though their listing says communal greenspace), who is the ultimate enforcer of this or does it eventually come down to a legal threat? I'm really not sure as it's in writing and in the listing. Is this basically the bottom line of all this communal living stuff? It's a little drab but I'm assuming so.

It's sad because the other units have friendly owners but all of the homes are new and one particular person is literally putting a lock on the communal area thinking it's for themselves because they couldn't read properly or are just lying and live close to it (not sure which but will assume it's a misunderstanding until proven otherwise).

The Call of the Road (Croatia),"I remember the first time we hit the road in that old T4 van. Croatia was our starting point, and the Adriatic coast didn’t disappoint. We cruised through winding coastal roads, with the sea sparkling on one side and dramatic cliffs on the other. Every corner revealed a new breathtaking view, the kind that makes you want to stop and soak in the moment forever. We camped by the sea, cooked our meals over a fire, and swam in hidden coves. It felt like we had escaped reality and found some kind of paradise.

But no road trip is perfect. The van, as reliable as it had been so far, started making this weird rattling noise. We ignored it at first—rookie mistake. One morning, just as we were ready to leave for Dubrovnik, the van refused to start. Hours were spent under the hot sun tinkering with the engine, and after a frustrating struggle, we discovered that the alternator was shot. A small mechanic in a nearby village became our savior, and after a few laughs (and a couple of beers shared while he worked), we were back on the road. Lesson learned: always befriend the locals.",30,6,1086,196,1
Weird experience with Qatar airways,"So, I was flying back home from an overseas travel and this happened during my last flight.

I flew economy without any special requests on my booking. Tried to ask her what it was about but she didn’t really explain and I was too tired after the first flight and long layover at that point.
My only guess is that I went up the level in their privilege program after the first leg on the way home as I got the email from them, but this seemed a bit much and also a little embarrassing as I got a few side eyes from other passengers lol.

 Magic in Macedonia,"Macedonia took us by surprise. It’s not the first place people think of when they plan a Balkan trip, but man, it should be. We drove through Skopje, with its mix of old-world charm and modern quirks, and ended up camping by Lake Ohrid. The stillness of the lake, surrounded by mountains, had this calming effect—like you were in a different world.

One night, we met a group of Macedonian travelers who invited us to a small village festival. There, we danced the traditional Oro until our feet hurt, ate enough homemade food to last us a week, and shared stories late into the night with people who treated us like family, despite the language barrier.

The trouble this time? Our van’s brakes started giving out as we navigated some steep mountain roads. It was a heart-stopping moment when we realized we couldn’t fully trust them. We nursed the van back to the nearest town, with every downhill stretch feeling like a gamble. A quick fix at another local garage got us going again, but it was a reminder that this adventure came with real risks.",19,4,1050,184,1
canadian traveling. need travel insurance with pre-existing medical condition (dx within 90 days),"hello all,

i started taking a cholesterol medication about 2 months ago (no other diagnoses).

anyone have suggestions.

December upstate NY travel ,"I’m looking for some assistance with upcoming travel. I’m looking to do two nights/three days in a new part of NY I haven’t been to (live in Jersey and will drive 4-5 hours). I found two spots that look pretty and are at the top of my budget (under $500/night with hotel taxes and fees). As a note, I had looked at Mohonk mountain house but just cannot justify the cost of staying there, though I see rave reviews (it’s also close enough for us to do a day pass, but just giving perspective on where I’ve looked).

Right now I’m considering the lake house at canandaigua in the finger lakes region. I like the idea of having wineries nearby and there’s a few close by restaurants. Inns of aurora also looks nice but it’s slightly more and being that I’m already at budget I’m not sure it’s worth it.

On the other hand, I looked at mirror lake inn over in the lake placid region. They have a spa there (which I like but isn’t a priority) and also great reviews, including food etc. 

I’m not a winter gal so I’d really just like a nice cozy atmosphere, good food and drinks, and some warm fireplaces. (One luxury resort in PA offers snow shoeing and that’s probably the most wintry activity I’d want to try out.)

How to compromise with our seller?,"\[UK\]

Our house purchase has ground to a halt.

The vendor tried to rush us into a quick exchange after a storm blew down their fence line. We only discovered this as we insisted on a viewing/inspection before exchange, it goes without saying that after seeing it, we refused to exchange until it was resolved.

The vendor has since insisted that the neighbour is responsible for the (shared) fence and assures us the neighbour has agreed to this, and so it was neither their problem nor their responsibilty to inform us. This is not supported by the transfer deeds, which apportion equal obligation, so it would seem this is just an informal arrangement.

We have never met the neighbour and do not feel comfortable taking it on trust that he will fix it, so in order to keep the sale moving and proceed to exchange, we suggested retaining funds with our solicitor until the repair is carried out, and then return the funds to the vendor. If it is not, for any reason, we would use the funds to carrry out the work ourselves.

Oddly, the vendor has completely lost their rag at this suggestion (which we believed to be quite reasonable) and refuses to engage with us on the issue from any other position that it is not his problem and shouldnt have to agree to those terms. The estate agent is quite transparently supportive of our point of view, but also has no luck in communicating reasonably with the vendor.

Although we have found the vendor to be churlish, rude and difficult every step of the way, we are only interested in getting this across the line and want to appeal to their better nature, so are there any suggestions for how we could frame the conversation to get a more positive outcome?",34,6,1707,299,0

Earnest Money - Out of State Buyer's Relocation Offer was Rescinded resulting in Loan rejection due to primary residence,"We are three days prior to closing and were notified that our out of state buyer's relocation offer was rescinded, and that their loan would be denied due to primary residence. There was a financial contingency for earnest money.

I may be misinformed, but I was under the impression that a relocation offer is not the same as a job offer - can this really impact the loan? Is a buyer allowed to simply choose not to move, resulting in a loan rejection with cause of primary residency (being out of state), and not pay any earnest money?

The contract is something along the lines..

**Lender must confirm in writing:**

1. The date Buyer's loan application for the Property was made, including a copy of the loan estimate that was provided to Buyer
2. That Buyer possessed sufficient non-contingent funds to close (e.g. down payment, closing costs, etc.)
3. The reasons Buyer was unable to obtain financing by Closing

**My questions:**

* Is a relocation offer considered a contingent fund?
* Assuming the Buyer had enough for #2 without the relocation offer, can they still choose not to move and get their earnest money back?

Simply put, we missed the ideal time to sell our home and are curious how a relocation offer being rescinded could impact earnest money.

Inheritance fromEstranged Family,"Hi all.

I live in New York.

Some background, I have been estranged from my family for almost 30 years. Absolutely no contact whatsoever.

About a month ago I got a call from an estate attorney in Indiana where I grew up. My mother passed away back in February of this year and she apparently owned a home with my grandmother and my aunt. 

She did not have a will when she passed and per this attorney I inherited her share of the home as her descendant per Indiana law.

In order to process I need to have a lawyer file a title passage affidavit at a cost of $750. That’s not the issue.

The issue is I don’t want to be saddled with a home with people who are now essentially strangers. Due to their economic background I’m not sure they have the funds to buy me out, and to be perfectly honest, due to our past history I don’t feel entitled to just give it over to them for nothing.

Why Do You Choose a REALTOR Over a Real Estate Attorney When Buying Property?,"I’m a Texas real estate attorney and REALTOR and I’m curious why many homebuyers and real estate investors opt to use a REALTOR instead of a real estate attorney during their property transactions. 

In my practice, I’ve noticed that many buyers don’t realize they could save on commissions and have the advantage of legal expertise guiding them through one of the biggest financial decisions they’ll make. As an attorney, I handle negotiations, review contracts, and ensure that buyers avoid potential legal pitfalls—all without the same commission structure as REALTORS.

I’d love to hear from you:  
- What made you choose a REALTOR when you bought a home or investment property?

Buying my first house and seller now wants to take the fridge after I made my offer,"I offered asking for the house. The listing had the fridge listed, but the seller wants to keep it. They've offered a credit, but we haven't agreed on an amount. Turns out, this thing costs between $6000-$7000 new. How much of that would you ask for in credit? All of it? All of it plus delivery and install? Some percentage to account for depreciation? Any opinions would be greatly welcomed.

"Level Airline - Customer Service / Flight cancelation rebook, phone check-in. ","Departure: LAX 

Arrival: BCN 

Direct flight   A300-200 

  
**My parent's flight to Barcelona**

1. they purchased a ticket months ago. One way ticket.

**Problem** 

1. Cancelation  A day before the flight, the initial flight was canceled, and they got re-assigned to a different flight day later. 

2. They were checked into a canceled flight, and the system said, they will receive boarding pass to new flight. They did not.  Website was buggy ( Can not select seat, get bording ) 

3. I was worried ( they will seat seperately, and have to wait long time at the airport ( assuming they are many who need to check in at the desk )   LAX traffic can be bad on sunday.



**Need to know** 

Level airline is subsidiary of Iberia airline.  Initial ticket was only $350 per person. ( VY flight)  the second flight tail number is IB, but operated by Level.

1. Level sells ticket in different Class.   ""Light"" Package does not include... MEAL.  You can still BUY snacks, but no meal is included.  Not ideal for long flight.  Make sure if you want the meal.   // Often people say ALL Level econ does not include food, but this is not true.

2. Call service center is open based on Spain time. FOR PST, the call center was open at 1 AM.  Once I called duing the hour, no line for service and CS was friendly.   

3. **For a case like this  Understand EU261.**  
  
- For all canceled flights,  Airline must give multiple option.    
   -- Refund and Cancelation of ticket  ( this can be done after missing the flight, because you bought something else 

   -- Rebook you to earliest different flight ( in my case they assigned a flight next day, but if you find better flight, you can request that airline ) 

  -- delay more than 6 hours or overnight delay,  if additional fee was incurred, They need to reimberse.  This is Duty of care ( meals, hotel, transport to hotel and to airport.. ) 

-- On top of cancelation of ticket with no fee, ( which was processed with no problem ) they owe you upto 600 Euro for delay or cancelation.  the amount varies based on delay.

4. EU 261 applied to all airline flying out of Europe.  // and all EUROPEAN airline flying into Europe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would try to opt in for European airline for this reason. for US &gt;&gt; EUROPE.



What I did

1. Called phone line, try to secured a seat and get boarding pass.  Rep said for case like this, their system is wonky and told me to go to desk and handle at the airport.   Can not check in over the phone. technically youu are not checked in, and you can LOSE. assigned seat.  

2. I looked up award flight and found their premium econ seat ( their highest tier) on lie-flat style seats ( 16 per airplain)    Transferred Amex points  30,000  &gt;&gt;&gt; BA &gt;&gt;&gt; Iberia.  per pax and booked it.   Cash value $1000 

3. Able to check in and get boarding pass  using iberia website ( the new ticket i purchased with points ) 

  
4. Called back to cancel original ticket ( about 10 hours away from the departure time ) without any fee or hassle.  The level airline refunded ticket next day.   **( The rep said I could have missed the flight and contact them later. which is good to know )** 

  
5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. ",78,12,3886,750,1

Does the HOA need reasonable cause for disapproval of a sale? Can someone else who lives here make a purchase with my money and put it in my name?,"I am in love with a property here in Florida right on the water. It's the condo next door. Unfortunately, my neighbor who lived there for 20 years had a stroke and had to move out of state. However, I connected with her son (we are both in recovery) when he came down to move her things. He told me he wanted me to have the place. I do not have the money to buy it, but my parents do and are happy to help me out. I feel so grateful they would even offer to do so! 

We waited a little bit, because they were going back and forth on things, and I didn't want to pressure them whatsoever. But once an offer was put on the place my parents sprung into action. We put down an offer and it was accepted! Until an hour later we got a call that they got a cash offer. It was more than $10,000 less but they took it anyway. A little background - the brother of the guy I became friends with has power of attorney and is not very kind. He said he didn't give a shit who lived there and just wanted it done. He does not care what his mother wants even though that place is the only thing she really cares about.

  
It looks like the cash offer is going to fall through because at first their story was they were buying it with employer housing assistance and two male employees were going to live there (1 bed, 1 bath). Then it turned out to be an investment firm trying to buy the entire complex, calling everyone who lives here. There are 7 of us total, but people are saying no because they love where we live. We are in the last area to be gentrified so it is still affordable, considering the view is of the inlet. Either way, the HOA said they were going to deny the sale and they have the power to do so. Our realtor called and asked to be the back up offer and they agreed. Then once again they called and said they had another cash back up offer. And so of course, they took that one as the back up. Hopefully if that falls through our deal will be taken.

I have a couple questions- does the HOA need a super solid reason to deny the sale? I have built a relationship/become a part of the community here and everyone wants me to have the place. (I know that's nice and all but isn't always enough lol).

There is also first right to refusal where another owner can buy the place if we want. Is it possible to give them the money and have them buy it in my name? 

My apologies for my ignorance on the topic. I have been reading the HOA rules from 1972 and trying to discern what is and isn't possible in this circumstance. I know they can't refuse based on discrimination, but was wondering if there were other reasons. It was pretty cut and dry with the first buyers being transient workers. But the back up offer is a mystery for now.

I have such an emotional tie to this place as do my parents. It has been a rollercoaster for us the past several days. If anyone has any thoughts or advice, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",146,29,2942,575,0

Did I get scammed? ,"So I recently canceled a hotel reservation with Expedia. I called the hotel and they gave me a number to call: (888) 432-7981.

This week I had signal and wanted to see if I could get the other 50% as it would be helpful considering the hurricanes impact on us.

[Florida] Section 8 tenant suing for Security Deposit for Early Termination Fee,"Florida

A Section 8 tenant requested to break her lease after only 4 months, so we signed a Mutual Rescission Agreement provided by Section 8. There is an Early Termination Fee of 2 months’ rent, so her entire security deposit is being withheld. The Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit was sent by certified mail and is being returned, but I also sent it by email. 

The Mutual Rescission Agreement states “We mutually agree to rescind the Housing Assistance Payment Contract, Lease and Lease Addendum to the Lease currently in effect for the residence located at… The effective date of this recession will be August 31, 2024. After which, the Housing Assistance Payments Contract is void and the tenant is responsible for the entire rent. 

Further, I, (tenant), agree to make full restitution to (landlord) for damages and/or unpaid rent. I understand that failing to comply with this agreement could result in forfeiture of my Housing Assistance from Orange County’s Section 8 Programs.” 

She doesn’t think she has to pay the Early Termination Fee and is demanding her security deposit back. This is her latest email reply: 
“You’ve already stated there’s no damages the apartment was left in great condition. We both mutually agreed to the termination. I did consult with a lawyer . I’m prepared to move forward . Any/ all legal fee &amp; court fee’s will be included in the law suit .” 

Did I do anything wrong or am I missing something here? Does she actually have a case? I can’t imagine a lawyer will say that the Mutual Rescission Agreement voids the Early Termination Fee Addendum that was signed in the beginning of the lease. 

I’m wondering whether the last paragraph of the Mutual Rescission Agreement would cover the Early Termination Fee/Liquidated Damages addendum that she signed with the original lease.",79,12,1845,307,0

Seller sent termination papers the day before closing with no checked box of a reason why.,"Hello me(26F) and my fiancé (28M) were buying a house. We have two kids a 7 year old and a 5 year old and we live in a small duplex. We have been searching for a house for a year and a half and we finally got accepted after putting an offer in. It is blocks from where we live now. We had a month until closing so we packed everything threw several things away told our landlord we will be out and I even switched over the utilities And two days before closing our realtor tell us that they didn’t realize until now that they were only making a $900 profit on the sale. They apparently had a $20,000  lean on the home a couple of years ago because they fell behind on payments. So I guess they didn’t realize that it would be taken out of their profit. They apparently have bad credit so no place will rent to them so they told a place they would front them a years rent without making sure they would have it. So when they realized they were not making the profit. They have no where to go. And then the day before closing they sent termination papers. We have not signed the termination papers. We went to closing anyways and signed everything but they did not show. We offered them $1000 and a week extension. Their own listing agent offered up his commission. They decided not to respond and are acting like nothing happened. We are currently trying to get a lawyer. What can we even do about this situation?

I’ve  gotten a lot of push back from family and friends saying things like it will take longer, it’s too complicated, etc but there is a housing shortage and people are asking crazy prices for what basically are sh*t shacks.

Old Mortgage Satisfaction (original) with Printed Notary Stamp?,"I purchased a property recently

There was a old mortgage on the property. It was paid off but never recorded as satisfied.

I had to work with an attorney to get the (now defunct) mortgage company to send the original mortgage satisfaction. (technically it was sent by the loan servicer)

It arrived today. It's clearly the original. It has the signatures of witnesses, parties, and the notary.

The only issue I noticed is that the notary stamp appeared to be *printed* on the document and not stamped. It's hard to notice, but I did notice.

This is an older document (2005).

Given I need to record this mortgage satisfaction, is it going to present an issue that the notary stamp was printed on?

The mortgage needs to be recorded with the state of South Carolina.

China in July - 15 days itinerary question,"Hello everyone!

I am trying to figure out a good itinerary for a trip to China, and I would very much welcome any criticism, tips and suggestions that you might have.

Here are my travel specifics and restrictions:

We are allowed a 15 day visa free entrance and we can only travel in July due to work. We are a couple, both 50 years old, and we are interested in history, technology, architecture and nature. We are quite well travelled but never been to China before.

I understand that the weather in July will be far from comfortable, therefore I thought to adapt my itinerary so that we visit mostly cities and have more indoors alternatives.

With that in mind, so far I've come up with this sample itinerary:

* Arrival in Shanghai – 3 nights
* Visit Wuzhen water town (by bus) – 1 night
* Hangzhou (by bus) – 2 nights
* Xiamen (by bullet train) – 3 nights
* Shenzhen (by bullet train) – 1 or 2 nights
* Guangzhou – 3 or 4 nights &amp; departure

I know I’ll be missing the most iconic sights, but I really can’t stand to treck the Wall or anything else in the expected heat and humidity levels… those will have to remain in the bucket list for now.

So, what do you think? Any input will be really appreciated, as there are not so many available resources for independent travel in China.

Do I have grounds for a charge back?,"I got a ticket for a greyhound bus ride and my app said to stand in either line D or E. I asked the employee who was escorting everyone where I should be and he said to line D. I asked 4 people in my line where they were going they all said the same place im going. So I said great I'm in the right spot. However, both those lines were going on 2 separate buses to the same place. When it came time to scan my ticket the driver said ""this isn't your bus"". I said how? I was told to come to this line and it's going to my destination. He said you missed your bus. And no, I did not come late. I was an hour in half early, my bus literally left minutes before. I asked can he please let me on the bus he said ""how much you got"" and was saying other very rude stuff to me but I digress. I lied and said I only have $20 so I gave him cash for him to let me on the bus. 

I contacted greyhound only wanting to get a partial refund of $20 on my ticket but they are of course saying it's nonrefundable. How is this my fault at all? Their app clearly said get in line D or E and the employee told me line D. The employees didn't even do calls for which bus is going where. You just had to assume what like to get in. 

The bus I got into by minutes managed to get to my destination so I was able to get onto the connecting bus. Which is why I asked for only a partial refund. But do I have grounds for a charge back? ",36,8,1409,300,1
Special assessment for new development feedback. ,"Pricing was recently released for a new development and the special assessments seem extremely high at approximately $920 per month. HOA is also $320 per month and only includes a few small community parks, no other amenities. 

Home prices are around $1.3-1.8 depending on model/lot/finishes and this is in Northern California. The special assessment are in addition to normal property taxes. 

I’m not very familiar with new construction and I’m wondering if this large of a special assessment is normal or is the developer passing along a lot of the infrastructure costs and still charging a premium? The community is in a good location with nice views, but the homes are already priced at the upper end of non-custom homes in the area. 

The special assessment effectively makes the monthly payment the same as a house that’s about 150k more, before even taking into account the HOA. ",49,7,888,148,0

EasyJet Cancellation refund ,"Hi,

We had an EasyJet flight from Madeira to Porto which got cancelled yesterday night and rescheduled to today. We had a train from Porto to Lisbon and hotel bookings which we had to cancel. 

We had to leave from Lisbon to Madrid on 9th Oct and since we only get a day in Lisbon due to cancellation we decided to not go to Lisbon altogether and booked a flight from Porto to Madrid.

All the flights are EasyJet and they are not allowing us to cancel the Lisbon to Madrid flights.

Is there anything that can we be done to get the refund of that one flight? ",28,4,561,106,1
travel in Europe ,"You know, for years, people have been romanticizing the whole “Eurotrip” thing. Yeah, the dream of hopping from one postcard-perfect city to the next, with a backpack and a camera, living that carefree, bohemian lifestyle. Sounds great, right? Well, let me tell you something – *fuck that*. Seriously, *fuck* traveling across Europe.

Don’t get me wrong – I’ve done the whole damn thing. I’ve been to more countries than I can count, from the beaches of Spain to the fjords of Norway, from the overpriced croissants in Paris to the *way-too-sober* mornings in Berlin. Hell, I’ve even hitchhiked through Eastern Europe with nothing but a packet of dried noodles and a head full of optimism. But after you’ve spent months traversing jungles in Southeast Asia, dodging drug dealers in Colombia, or climbing mountains in the Andes with oxygen levels low enough to make you rethink your entire life, Europe starts to feel like a monotonous joke.

Let me give you an example. You’re in Poland, you book a train to Italy. Sounds nice, right? Wrong. That ""quick train ride"" is a goddamn *nightmare*. Polish trains are never on time. You’re standing there, waiting, cursing the damn thing, freezing your balls off in winter or melting in the summer heat. When the train finally arrives, you’re packed in like sardines, everyone avoiding eye contact like it’s a national sport. Then you get to Germany, where the trains are a bit better, but the prices? They’ll have you selling a kidney just to make it to the next city. And God forbid you accidentally sit in a reserved seat! The death stares you get – you’d think you just insulted someone’s grandmother.

And don’t even get me started on the airports. Europe’s airports are an exercise in frustration, particularly if you’ve ever experienced the beautiful chaos of places like Bangkok or Mexico City. In Asia, shit just *works*. Somehow, in the madness, it all flows. Sure, you’ve got tuk-tuks, street vendors, and honking taxis everywhere, but it’s a *vibe*. It’s alive. You feel like you’re part of something. In Europe? You’re standing in a mile-long line in London Heathrow, some passive-aggressive staff member shouting at you to remove your shoes, belt, laptop, dignity… whatever else you might be holding on to after security. Then there’s the *constant* delays – oh, the weather, the staff are on strike, or the pilot’s just having a bad day. And when you finally board, you’re greeted with a rock-hard sandwich for 15 euros. *Cheers*.

It’s not just the logistics that make me want to scream. It’s the vibe, man. I’ve done long stretches in Southeast Asia, Central America, Africa – and what’s different is, people are open. They talk. They want to hear your story, even if it’s just broken English. You can be sitting on the back of a rusty pickup truck in Vietnam with a bunch of locals who can’t speak a word of Polish or English, but somehow, you’re all laughing at the same shitty joke made through gestures and grunts. That’s *connection*.

In Europe? Try talking to anyone on a tram in Prague. Just try. You’ll get a raised eyebrow, maybe a grunt, if you’re lucky. Everyone’s glued to their phones, earphones in, like they’ve got this invisible bubble around them that says, “Stay the hell away from me.” And I’m not even talking about just the locals – the travelers too. There’s this weird competition in Europe – “Oh, you haven’t seen the *real* Croatia until you’ve stayed in some backwater Airbnb for 200 euros a night and posted about it on Instagram.” It’s exhausting. Like, buddy, I’ve slept in bamboo huts, bathed in a river with locals in Laos, and watched the sun rise over the Himalayas. I don’t need your overpriced tapas and fancy hostel recommendations.

And the fucking tourists. Jesus Christ, the tourists. You try going to Florence or Barcelona in the summer and you’ll swear off traveling for life. Hordes of them, following around some poor guide waving a flag in the air, taking the same pictures as everyone else, clogging up every single picturesque alley with their selfie sticks and matching hats. It’s like a dystopian zombie movie, but instead of brains, they’re after *“authentic experiences”* that they’re going to forget the moment they fly back home.

Look, I get it. Europe has history, beauty, and all that jazz. But you know what? After living out of a backpack for years, roaming around places where people *actually* live in the moment, Europe just feels… sterile. Controlled. It’s like you’re going through the motions of travel, but without the soul. There’s no edge. No real danger. I miss the thrill of getting lost in a country where you can’t speak the language, relying on the kindness of strangers, eating food you’ve never heard of, and just *being* in the chaos of it all.

So, yeah, Europe is pretty and all, but after you’ve had your fair share of real, gritty, life-changing travel experiences, it’s hard not to see it for what it is – a neatly packaged, overpriced, overhyped playground for tourists who think they’re adventurers. Give me the wild jungles, the sketchy bus rides, the street food that might give you food poisoning but tastes like heaven any day over another €8 croissant and a “hidden” piazza full of influencers.",17,4,5240,866,1

"Should I go with the lowest interest rate for mortgage?
","I'm quoting a few lenders for a mortgage currently. One of the lenders has a rate that's about 0.25% less than all the other lenders, but I'm wonder what other things I should be looking out for before I make a decision purely on using the lender with the lowest rate?

For this particular lender, I asked how much refinancing in the future would cost and how it'd work with his lenders, an dhis response was ""Refinancing is the same with every lender. A lot of lenders like to talk about the deal they'll give you when you refinance if you use them on the purchase but it's all smoke and mirrors.

We close in 2 days. The listing suddenly shows a Flood Factor Score of 6/10 despite all other sources showing minimal risk. Anyone else having this issue?,"We close on our house in two days. As of a few days ago, Zillow and Redfin are now showing “Climate Risk” factors on listings-we never saw them over the last few weeks. The flood rating on the house is 6/10 and considered a *major risk* and obtaining flood insurance is *critical*. Obviously we kind of freaked out and started doing research because there has been absolutely no indication of flood risk to the property nor is there a disclosure about a past flood. 

The house is not on a floodplain. The FEMA rating is X and unshaded (the lowest rating possible). **Both state and county flood maps do not show the house to be at risk**. Our mortgage and insurance providers both agree there is little to no risk. We understand that anything can happen-no house can be guaranteed 100% safe from everything. But this high score seems very undeserved.

At this point, we are more concerned about potential resale than actual flooding. It’s alarming to see such a high score on listings. How many people will do their own further research to see how much of a threat there really is?

The scores are being provided through Firststreet.org. We spent a lot of time going through the website to determine its legitimacy. In many respects it seems legitimate, but they admit to not having a lot of pertinent information on specific lots, such as drainage improvements and mitigation. Our specific listing also says that the property had “1 flood at this property since 2001”. We started a free trial to look at the details of this flood (they want you to pay to access this information!) and it says **0ft** and *no damage*. There was never a flood at the property!

Furthermore, the website states “Neighborhoods, zip codes, cities, and counties are considered to have been impacted by a historic flood if any of the properties within their boundaries were impacted.” So, many listings will have high scores and notes about past flooding events even if no flood water has touched them. 

According to this website, in the worst case scenario they predict $0 in damage to the house. This is crazy. 

Anyone else seeing high scores on the property they are selling or looking to buy? What are your thoughts? While some scores are probably warranted, others may do a lot of unnecessary harm to potential buyers and sellers. ",154,27,2317,400,0

"Douro Valley by Train suggestions.
","Hi all,

Going to Porto with my fiancé on October 16th and on the 20th we play to do a full day trip to Douro Valley.

I was looking at tour guides but I'm seeing iffy reviews for a lot of them in my price range (around $100-$150CAD/person). It seems like a better idea to do it ourselves.

My rough idea so far is to take the train from Sao Bento station to Pinhao. It looks like there are 2 wineries nearby there (Bomfim and Carvalhas) so we'll check those out and see what tours or tastings they have available. We plan to also do a cruise in Douro river while at Pinhao (depending on the weather since we're going in rainy season).

There's a viewpoint ""Miradouro de Casal de Loivos"" that doesn't seem too far if taking an uber/bolt so we were thinking of checking that out too.

I was also thinking of stopping at Regua first and then taking a boat tour to Pinhao instead (again this would be dependent on the weather)

Are there any must-sees in this area that I'm missing by taking a train? Anything nearby worth taking an uber/bolt to? Any suggestions in general?

how/where do I start?!!,"Is there a site, book, podcast, journal, etc. that has an ""explain it like I’m 5"" approach guide to real estate investing? I know snippets of how it all works, but would love to find a well laid-out explanation of how to start for a complete beginner. Also considering a mentorship.

For some details;

-I have a year of 100% free time to learn (and then part time after) and ideally would like to be in the industry and making a bit of income within a few months. 

-I’m willing to put $10,000 (cad) in at first, which is the majority of my savings.

-I have high school diploma and nothing else (having graduated this June).

I’m Canadian, living in France for the next 3-5 years (at least) and willing to travel within EU. 

I have the ability to work online or around my city and surrounding areas. I cannot have formal meetings with many locals as my native language is English and I cannot communicate well enough in French to sound professional. Also, I look young for my age and I feel like this puts me below others when working in-person.

How can I start? 

Ideally I’d like to put a down payment on a small affordable condo (there is potential assistance from family if I have a legit plan), gently refurbish, use my marketing skills to advertise as an Airbnb (using socials to promote) and use this as monthly income while managing from afar. This money would go directly into paying off the condo, and then I would hope it sell it once the value rises after 4 years or so, splitting the cost to put down payments on 2 different condos. Repeat the process but x2, once paid off, keep one and split the other as down before. Is this feasible? ",23,4,1655,300,0

"What are some of your favourite parts of your country to travel, and why? ","I’ve become a happy domestic traveller for various reasons— including personal preference at this stage in life.

So I’ve been wondering— is there any part of your country that is a favourite to you for travelling, and why? 

For me it’s hard to choose one, so it would be a toss-up between Yorkshire or the West Country in England (inc. Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall). 

I love visiting Yorkshire for its many friendly, multicultural and creative communities, the world-class curries and range of other foods, and nature. Woodlands (tree cover is really low in Britain, sadly), purple heather moors, greenery, cosy towns, beautiful skies, and probably the most crisp air in the country. Also iconic architecture, like Whitby Abbey and the Piece Hall. 

The West Country is another favourite. Granite sea cliffs, pristine white and red-sand beaches, glittering turquoise seas. The plants can be so fragrant - like honeysuckle, dog roses, and wild garlic. 

All in all, I like Yorkshire as it rolls some of England’s best qualities into one place: diversity, heritage, nature, community character, etc. And the West Country is best for my aroma and colour therapy. 🩵🤍🩷💚💜

Anyway, I look forward to reading where you like to spend time in your country! ",74,15,1258,204,1
Has anyone done a ski vacation in Switzerland? ,"Having decision paralysis due to so many ski resort options! 

We’re a couple, intermediate skiers, used to skiing in PNW (eg Whistler), we would stick to groomed runs rather than exploring off-piste. 

Would love to experience riding trains to go skiing, and beautiful views of mountains or the village. 

We’re also big foodies, so access to good food is a priority. Not that interested in a big party or clubbing atmosphere, but it’s ok if that’s what comes with villages that have great food. 

Does anyone have advice on which Swiss ski resorts to visit? So far I’ve been researching:

- Crans Montana (included with Epic local pass)
- Andermatt (included with Epic local pass)
- Zermatt (seems like the obvious must-see)
- Verbier (heard good things about it from reddit)
- Jungfrau region (Grindelwald, Wengen, Murren - have been in the summer and loved it)

Budget is around $300/night hotel. Not looking for 5 star luxury but just decent clean and comfortable rooms in a good location.

Is it worth getting the Delta Amex and AA Mastercard for the lounges?,"Hi everyone 

I have been traveling a good amount for work - at least 2-3 nights per month and I wanted to check in and get opinions on these credit cards.

Ten days in Brazil 🇧🇷 ,"Recently I had the chance to visit Brazil and wanted to share some of my picture and experiences.  I know Brazil sometimes doesn’t have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in São Sebastião.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it’s far enough away from everything I wouldn’t do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn’t feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it’s always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan. We fucked that up!)

Pictures 16-17:  great tour / hiking day through the Tijuca urban rainforest.  Saw tons of waterfalls, animals, caves and spectacular views

They certainly didn’t go to bat for me submitting modest offers but the most I could afford.

Trip Review: 11 days in Turkey,"Merhaba! So this is a 11 day VERY detailed itinerary (budget, hotel, excursions, airport transfer included). We traveled to Istanbul, Cappadocia and Alacati in September 2024. We are a group of 6 Americans, 3 couples, in our mid 30s, and joined by a 7th person in Alacati. Please keep in mind, our budget is higher than average so there are premium/expensive items on this list.

We enjoy history, chilling, drinking, being a tourist and eating a ton of food.

In addition, I’ve read several recent posts about negative experiences in Turkey. If you are interested in going, it is better to overplan than have no plan at all. From what I’ve read, you’ll have a fairly bad time if you don’t do your due diligence in researching hotels and restaurants. Use a mix of google reviews and tripadvisor. But if a place has 5 stars and 5000 reviews, look at the reviews, because some restaurants and hotels use bots to make it seem better than it is. So if a place has really good reviews, but a lot of reviews are from accounts with only one review, it’s probably bots. Also be aware of local scams, like taxis scams or the shoeshine, etc. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself, say “no” if you feel uncomfortable. The worst scam I faced came from a transfer company that I’ll mention at the end (no, they did not get my money and I hope they lost money).

Costs: First off, we went with Turkish airlines for everything. We wanted nonstop flights and they were the easiest airline with direct flights. I downloaded the Turkish airlines app and it is fairly easy to use. -Our round trip flights were from LAX to IST ($8890 business class) -IST to NAV($184) -NAV to ADB, connection in IST($179) -ADB to IST($233) -Total for 2 people: With travel insurance, flights were $9727.

Secondly, hotels were pre booked on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Expedia or through the hotel website. We also got higher end rooms such as suites. These prices are for 2 people. -Sultanahmet area: Henna hotel for 4 nights and it was approximately $560 -Goreme: Zara cave hotel for 2 nights for $700. -Alacati: D’mira Alacati hotel for 4 nights for $733. -Total for 2 people, 10 nights : $2166 for hotels.

Third, we chose prepaid airport transfer van services so we didn’t have to deal with our luggage. I booked these transfers through Viator. You could get away with using airport taxis or the new metro instead of transfers in Istanbul, but the other two airports are smaller, so pre book a transfer or rent a car before coming to Turkey. The first company we used was ‘İstanbul Vip Transfer’. It cost $120 for a round trip transfer from IST to Sultanahmet area split 3 ways ($40) The second company was ‘Helios transfer’. It cost $175 from NAV to Goreme round trip split 3 ways. ($58). Finally we used ‘Alantransfer Airport Transfer’. It cost $272 from ADB to Alacati round trip split 4 ways ($70). Total: $168 for airport transfers for 3 cities.

Fourth, tours/excursions: -Cagaloglu hamam for 2 for $140 plus tip ($170 for 2) -Sunset Bosphorus cruise for 4 ($44 a person - $88) via Airbnb -Hot air balloons in cappadocia ($500 for 2) and the hotel booked it for us. -Private red tour plus in Cappadocia ($219 for 6 people -$73) -Snorkeling with Saint Mary Tours ($48 a person - $96) -Total: $927 for 2 people for extra excursions

Food/drinks/souvenirs/additional taxis: -I’m not going to do a full breakdown, but I would estimate for everything extra was around $1800- so about $225 per day (yes, again, we are bougie people) So overall, for us, it was about $15k for everything

Dishonorable mention:

* Joy trip transfer in Alacati:
   * This transfer service is owned by liars and rude people
   * First off, when I had messaged them asking for airport transfers, they offered Ephesus tours. I did not inquire or even want an Ephesus tour before that. Once I had booked the tour, I was unable to change the timing for the tour even though hotel managers I talked to before were able to make changes to reservations. Also, I had booked the tour well in advance, starting in July. I asked if it could be switched from morning to night. The person messaging me said “The guide will meet you in Ephesus. This is our agreement with the guide. You want to make changes all the time, but this is not right.” Idk, it gave me the ick. It was unprofessional and weird; they could have just said, sorry we can’t change it. If I had known it was that much trouble for them, I would have handled the tour myself or just would have never booked it.
   * Then, I found out that this company lied to me. They told me that we could NOT do a self guided tour and that we needed a tour guide in order to enter Ephesus. I suppose it’s my fault that I didn’t do more research on this, but my friend really wanted an Ephesus tour, so they seemed the most convenient.
   * Then when I canceled the tour because of the lies, they proceeded to harass me for hours. I blocked and reported them immediately, but they used other WhatsApp numbers to try to guilt me into paying for this tour.
   * I don’t want an apology from them, I don’t want anything from them. Do not contact me.
   * TLDR: if you want an honest company, avoid them at all cost

**Final thoughts about Istanbul:** 

* \*I do NOT recommend Istanbul as a travel destination for anyone with small Children that still use a stroller. Istanbul is VERY hilly and has cobblestone streets. It is hard enough as a healthy adult, it is extremely hard to do this trip with a stroller.
* \*In that same vein, Istanbul will be difficult with people with disabilities. My friend can walk but she does have joint pain issues. Stairs can be steep and have small steps. Elevators can break down. Some places have smooth concrete that shoes have a harder time gripping. Again, hilly.
* \*If I could describe Istanbul in one word: electric. There’s so much energy in the city. So much to do, so much to see. Even at 3 am you could still just walk around and admire historical sites or find a bar to relax in. I can see why people say you need at least 4 days in Istanbul. You really could spend two weeks here and keep finding new places
* If I had more time, I would have explored Karakoy, kadikoy and gone through istiklal street.

**Final thoughts on cappadocia :** 

* \*I see why there’s an entire tourism industry wrapped up in these balloons, they are  magical
* \*The food in Goreme is… not great …if I knew this beforehand I would have just gone to the cheapest possible doner kebab place or Burger King lol
* \*The non hot air balloon tours are also nice to do, but just be prepared for heat. I wouldn’t say those tours are a must, but if you don’t do hot air balloons and if you don’t like souvenir shopping you don’t have many other options.

**Final thoughts on Alacati:** 

* \*The walkable town center is fantastic, such a cute and photogenic town
* \*Taxis are easy to get, and easy to use, definitely would have been cheaper to rent a car but we didn’t want to deal it
* \*My Turkish friend described Alacati as “where rich Turks vacation” and I believe it. Prices are high and the beach club had very fit people lol

**Final thoughts on the trip:** 

* It is not a budget destination, inflation has hit the country hard. Don’t expect prices to be the same as 5 years ago. It’s not crazy expensive like Switzerland but it’s more on par with US prices.
* I think Turkish people are some of the nicest people around but there were a few assholes. There were definitely people who were out to scam us, touts that constantly begged you to come to their shop, but there were also several people that bent over backwards to help us and showed us amazing hospitality.
* I would say as a petite female, I did not feel unsafe or worried about my safety. I was worried about pickpockets but not my well being.
* You can easily get away with just English in these areas. I used google translate very few times on the trip.
* Depending on the age and activity level of your group, tours were actually the low point, not that they were bad, but we could have just explored on our own; tours were just too structured for us
* Best food of the whole trip? Azize alacati meyhane, but Alacati in general had consistently great food, whereas Istanbul had great and mediocre food and Cappadocia was just not good
* Kitty cats everywhere pspspspspspspsps
* After approximately 12 cups of Turkish coffee, I can confirm I do not like it, sorry Turkey. After 45 cups of Turkish cay, I can confirm that it is absolutely delicious.
* I loved Turkey and I loved the food and the people, 10/10 amazing place",30,6,20444,2185,1
Commission Problem,"Context: I am in the process of getting my RE license in my state. Yet to take the exam, halfway finished with the course. My partner is a licensed agent, and I independently conducted market research, gathered insights, and created an information packet for my partner to send to an investor, subsequently leading them to submit an offer on the property. My partner and I have agreed to a 50/50 split on the commission, however, being unlicensed poses some legal concerns. 

What are our options to ensure I am compensated without violating laws and being investigated for unlicensed RE activity?

I did not engage in any sales activities, nor did I communicate with any parties on either buyer or seller side. I simply conducted and compiled market research for the licensed agent to close a sale on his own. 

There is a 90 day closing period, is it possible to get licensed and a referral fee in that period without raising any concern by my state's RE commission? Or charge my partner a consulting fee? Speak with an attorney?

Any insights would help. Thank you

Theft deterrents for an unoccupied property?,"I’m a homeowner with a house for sale on a busy street. It is obvious from the listing photos that the house is unoccupied because it is staged with nice furniture and decorations. Someone cut the realtor lockbox off the door yesterday, got inside, and stole some items. I rekeyed the lock and now we are using a heavy duty lockbox, not a realtor lockbox.

How does inheriting a house work?,"Ok so, I've already lost my father a couple years ago, and today my mother just told me that she had a scan today and might have to battle cancer for the third time... She is dead set on giving me the house before anything happens, but neither of us know how that would affect the curent mortgage. As we all know mortgage rates are crazy in the US right now so I have a couple questions if anyone knows.

If she puts the house in my name can I keep her current monthly payment or how does that work?

And does her giving me the house stop me for being able to get first time homeowners loans later on?",33,6,601,118,0

"Bay Area appraised value significantly low, need help! Thanks","Hi, about six months ago, my business partner and I purchased a 12-unit commercial property (apartments) in the Oakland area for approximately $1.2M. Unfortunately, our business agreements aren't working out, and we never signed a TIC (Tenancy in Common) contract. Now, my partner is trying to buy me out.

We were in the process of refinancing, and the lender's independent appraisal valued the property at around $1.4M. However, I'm concerned about this figure. The property was originally purchased for approximately $1.9M in 2018, and it seems unusual for it to now be appraised at only $1.4M after six years, especially given that the surrounding area has appreciated in real estate value. There was no appraisal when we bought it, which complicates things further.

The appraiser justifies the $1.4M value by pointing to our recent purchase price of $1.2M, despite the fact that some repairs have been made and the property is cash flow positive. I’m worried that we might be miscalculating the property's value.

I’m confused about what my next steps should be:

1. Should I force the sale of the property, hoping it will sell for more than the appraised value?
2. Should I get a separate appraisal? However, if the second appraisal is also low, I might still be stuck with a buyout offer based on the $1.4M value. Plus, appraisals for large properties like this are expensive.

I’m feeling really unsure and anxious about the situation and would greatly appreciate any advice on what to do next.

Thank you so much for helping out!",61,9,1539,250,0

I was thinking of doing a HELOC to access some equity and use it for my next property. Does anyone know banks that offer HELOCs for investment properties? Thanks in advance friends!",39,5,313,55,0
"Taking a couple week break from work, want to spend few days of those travelling. Need tips.","Basic info: Flying from London, looking to stay at either one place for 4 days, or in one city 2 and the other 3. Will be staying in hostels. At the end of October.

And I honestly have no clue where I actually want to go, hence need for tips, lol.

Currently, I'm undecided between first city being Rome or Athens. Both for architecture and historical reasons. 

Any places you guys could recommend that I could go to? Anything that doesn't require more than 2 days to see major stuff.  And preferably the one with good public transport system.  

For references, the cities that I visited and also enjoyed:

Berlin - nightlife, history.

Krakow - architecture

Budapest - architecture, night life.

Needing estimates on this $1.25M House Now(whether to buy) or Keep Saving for 2 More Years?,"

I'm looking to get an estimate of how much I would be paying monthly for this property. 

A little background of myself: I own my own business, and if I stay on track, I expect to gross $400K this year. After expenses, I’ll net $239K, and after paying myself, I'll have $142K left to put into savings. By the end of this year, I’ll have about $357K in savings. By the end of 2025, I expect to gross around $600K, netting $369K before my salary, leaving me with $273K to add to my savings, which should total around $630K.**360 Huntsville Idetown Rd, Dallas, PA**

**Situation:**

My wife, our two children, and I are currently looking for a house. We’ve found one that’s been on the market for over a year without any buyers. I feel the interior needs quite a bit of updating. We're considering purchasing it for $1.15 million. I’d appreciate help estimating how much I would likely be paying monthly if I put 20% down (and I’m also open to your thoughts on whether 20% is the best option).

  
Property:

* **Link:** [360 Huntsville Idetown Rd, Dallas, PA](https://www.lewith-freeman.com/real-estate/luzerne-county-mls/residential/property/24-2753-360-huntsville-idetown-road-dallas-pa-18612/)
* **Total Sq. Ft:** 8,106 (5,123 finished above ground, 2,983 finished basement)
* **Lot Size:** 5.23 acres
* **Bedrooms:** 4
* **Bathrooms:** 7 (3 full, 2 half, 2 three-quarter)
* **Taxes:** Estimated $26,223/year
* **Garage:** 4 stalls, attached
* **Year Built:** 2000
* **Utilities:** Central AC, gas heat, community well, on-site sewer
* **Features:** Modern kitchen, finished basement, lake view, security system, master bedroom on 1st floor, wet bar, deck, whirlpool tub, invisible fencing

My guesstimates:

* **Mortgage (Principal &amp; Interest):** $5,800 - $6,000
* **Property Taxes:** $960 - $1,440
* **Homeowners Insurance:** $200 - $300
* **Maintenance/Repairs:** $950
* **Utilities:** $380 - $710

 **Total Monthly Costs:** **$8,290 to $9,400**

Probably have to put in $200k for updating at least?

What are your thoughts? Is this property a worthwhile investment, or should I continue saving for another two years and wait for something better to come on the market?",91,16,2179,320,0

Boarding pass not assigned at check in (online),"Is it just me or have others noticed that there airlines seem less likely to assign a boarding pass when you do online check in? Seems like I always used to check in online, get my boarding pass, and then show up at the airport ready to go.

But on the last few flights of mine no boarding pass has been assigned when I checked in. Now I get a confirmation of check in that I have to then take to the airport to get my boarding pass. But that means having to go and line up at the  bag drop line and that can take an hour at least. As I have no bags to drop that makes for a very frustrating experience!

  
Edit: this is flights to/from US, UK, France, Netherlands.

This seems like a new frustration and has happened on BA, Air France and KLM on my last few flights.

Is there a trick I am missing here? Let me know if this is just normal nowadays or or if there's something I am doing wrong.

Example airline email:

Dear passenger, 

You have successfully checked in! Please note: We cannot provide you the boarding pass online now, you need to obtain it at the airport.

**How to obtain your boarding pass:**

* Come early to the airport on the day of your flight to make sure you have enough time to obtain your boarding pass.
* Go to a check-in counter, even if you travel with hand baggage only.
* Once all necessary steps are taken, one of our agents will provide you with a boarding pass to go through security checkpoints and to board your flight.",47,8,1458,272,1

How often should my agent communicate with me. ,"

I am the seller. I put my house on the market with a broker almost two weeks ago. So far, I’ve had 5 showings. My broker only showed one of them, the remaining 4 were from buyer’s agent. My broker told me to download the app HouseByShow to keep track of showings and feedbacks. She hasn’t initiated any text or phone calls regarding my house. I was the one who reached out to her after the first week and she did give me a run down of the feedbacks but referred me to the app. Going onto end of week 2 and no communication. Is this normal? Is she just going to initiate communication when there is an offer ? Or wait for a while to reevaluate the price? What should I do? She is co-listing with another broker and he took the pictures of my house. Honestly they were not good pictures. They were dark and blurry and didn’t highlight the features of my house. I had to ask him to use a picture that I took for the first picture, because his was too dark.

I speak pretty solid French and have been to France a ton, including wine tours in Burgundy, Loire Valley, Bordeaux, Provence, and Champagne.

I'm open to staying anywhere along the wine route as long as it's reasonably easy to access.

"Bought a Property, found out that seller did not abide by closing agreement.  Similar experience/suggestions?","I bought a home in 2020, with two structures (think in-law apartment) on the property. Separate electric, plumbing, walls, parking etc for both. 

Part of the closing agreement was that the seller would connect to public sewer, from the failing septic for both structures. 

The seller contracted a construction company that connected one of the structures to public sewer, the other was left on septic, unknowingly. The plumber connected to the wrong pipe. The construction company did not have access to the home to check the drains at the time of the work, house was vacant. 

I did not find out until 3 years later with a $3000 sewage backup from the existing septic tank. 

Seller signed a septic abandonment clause, I cannot pull a septic permit to have the work remedied and it’s about $5-7k to have the issue resolved. 

Has anyone had any similar experience?

Would title insurance cover this?

Does anyone have any suggestions? I had a brief conversation with an attorney who suggested pursuing the plumber as an option but was not definitive and it was not hired counsel, more of an informal conversation. 

Any suggestions/advice appreciated. Seller has been unresponsive. 

Edit to add:

Construction company took the “whoopsies” approach and shrugged it off. Seller also documented she had been regularly servicing both septic tanks, and knew both were there. When initially confronted she denied responsibility. 

Cost of civil pursuit would likely just about equal cost of making the repair myself. ",109,16,1515,243,0

"Mexico City, Rome, or Dubai? 3 month trip over January to March","Hi all, trying to figure out which of these destinations would be best for a 3 month trip next year.

My current ranking is:

1. Rome
2. Dubai
3. Mexico City

But I'm very open to hearing from anyone who can provide advice.

My considerations

* No budget concerns, price is not a factor
* Rome would be winter, so the weather might not be good? Unsure about this. Plus side is that it will be way less busy and its football season and I love football
* How friendly and open are people in these cities? I've heard Mexico City is great for meeting new people, idk if the same can be said of Rome and Dubai?

If you had to pick one, which would it be?",63,12,650,118,1
Keep deposit? ,"I was listing agent for land. 

Buyers agent submitted offer, cash, close 30 days no contingency.

Buyer dragged feet for almost 60 days talking about title issues and looking into it.  

Buyer backs out days before the rescheduled closing citing buyer backed out per attorneys advice on title issues.  

I found out the buyer was also buying abutting land and it failed to perc. (No public sewer available and that’s why they backed out of my sale.  

I called buyers agent with this new info but didn’t tell her I knew full the full story.  

She just repeated that due to title issues they can’t purchase, never mentioned the failed perc test.  

I have not spoken with their attorney, so I’m not sure if the buyers agent is lying or if their attorney is lying to get the deposit back.   $2000

This closes to a new buyer this week so I‘ll be reaching out to our attorney to see where this stands.  

Am I right for trying to keep deposit?

Bodybuilding and travel,"Hi there,

Travelling to the USA (Boston, Ma) in a couple of days and I am a bodybuilder, I'm doing my trt shot the day I leave so no concerns with taking in testosterone as I won't need it. However I take telmisartan/cialis/arimidex all with no prescription. I am travelling from the UK. 

I wondered if the 3 medications listed were okay to bring in or whether I am gonna land myself in hot water. Telmisartan is a BP med, cialis is for ED but I use for BP management as well and arimidex is in case of increase in estrogen. I am only taking enough for the 14 days I'm there but like I say I am concerned if they are prohibited or not? Remembering I don't have a script.

Urgent property tax issue! Would seller financing be an option?,"My dad is disabled. He owns a house and lived in it until he suddenly became disabled and was no longer able to climb stairs and the bedroom and bathroom were on the second floor. They moved into a rental and used the income from renting their house to pay their rent. They were receiving a senior exemption and they were unaware that they were not entitled to receive that if they could no longer live in the house. In July, the county tax assessor let them know that they owed $16,000 in back taxes due August 1. When this amount was not paid by Sept 1st they added a 20% collection fee and 12% interest and just five weeks later the amount due is $6000 more so that they owe $22,000. They live on a fixed income and can’t pay these taxes. If they sell the home, they’ll need every dollar of their equity to subsidize and be able to continue to pay their rent. They need to sell quickly, but can’t afford to sell below market value and they are worried about these taxes quickly consuming every dollar they have in equity! Looking for ideas! 

As a realtor, I have fielded seller financing offers. The last one I received offered market value for the house, payment of all commissions plus closing costs and a balloon payment after seven years. no one at my brokerage has experience with these kind of deals and they seem very risky for the seller if the buyer defaults. Is this even an option for my parents since they have a mortgage for about $72,000 and they owe taxes that are currently $22,000? seems the county is determined to extract all of the equity in the home as quickly as possible! Adding these kind of penalties so quickly just doesn’t even seem legal! At this rate, by the time they sell the house, will be lucky if they have any equity at all!

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Has anyone had any successful seller financing deals where the buyer paid faithfully and did not default?",63,10,1916,351,0

I'm rethinking purchasing a home because of global warming.,"I paid cash for my last house. I recently sold it and am now doing a month-to-month rental, looking for a new house. After watching Hurricane Helene I am rethinking whether I should purchase, and if I do, if I should pay cash again or take out a loan with 20% down.

My thinking is that insurance companies will fold from these huge disasters, or our homes won't be insurable because of X reason. Then if something like Helene comes along you lose everything if you owned it outright. If you only invested 20% and have the rest in an index fund (like VTSAX) then you only lose the 20% you invested. If disaster doesn't strike you still gain equity (hopefully) and the benefit of owning your own house, which I love.

I am in the Eugene area which is west of most of the fire hazard area in Oregon but still seems iffy. I have family in Paradise, California and all eight of them had their houses torched over the last several years. They were insured, but how much longer will these homes be insurable?

I don't know. The cat woke me up because she wanted attention and I couldn't stop thinking about this.",59,9,1106,202,0

So far, we're expecting a minimal itinerary: A walk in town, occasionally grab dinner, visit a beach or two. Because we're a large group, most places that can accommodate us are a drive away, or a good 30-minute walk, from the town centre or beach.

Mortgage Rates vs Rental Rates not making sense,"I am actively trying to scale my real estate portfolio in order to achieve financial freedom but I feel like I constantly am running into blockers...would love to hear from some of you

[Netherlands] Anyone does short weekend/day trips around europe?,"I live in the Netherlands(Eindhoven) and I am considering doing short weekend/day trips around europe.

I know of two options. One is flixbus. Second one is NS international.

Yet another option is to take the train from Eindhoven to Amsterdam and then I would get more options.

I want to do short/quick trips every other weekend. And want to avoid the long waiting times at the airports.

When I am there I might stay the night at a hotel or return the same day.

The only one I have done so far is Eindhoven to Antwerpen via Ns international. Although there arent many Eindhoven to X city possibilites. I guess I need to first travel to Amsteerdam always?

Flixbus is good too and it guarantees a seat. Although maybe slower than NS international.

Need advice from anyone who has done this before.

Owner's Title Insurance,"Buying a house for $1.2million, cash. In Atlanta, Georgia. Buying without real estate agents involved. I know the seller personally. 

(Lots of equity from my last home. Lucked out buying low and selling high. First time in my life something has ever worked out)

On the closing statement I see:

* ""Title Examination Fee to Traditional Title Services:"" $275  
* Owner's Title Insurance to Old Republic National Title Insurance Company Coverage: $6,827.05 

Closing attorney insists this ""Owner's Title Insurance"" is worth it, its a one time cost. But reading the policy's exclusions list, seems like any scenario where this policy would kick is is conviently excluded. 

I am now also learning that the closing attorney will keep a nice chunk of this premium as a comission, makes sense why they're pushing it so hard. 

At the same time, this is a HUGE purchase. I really despise insurance, any time i've ever had to use it they've pulled every trick out of their bag to not pay out what is actually due.

This is the reality of home ownership.,"Bought our house right before Covid made the market crazy (literally a week or two before) so we did not pay an inflated price but neither did we sell previous house for inflated price.

We have been steadily renovating (house has excellent bones but needed updating, built in 1962 - we bought from the original owner)

Our last renovation was updating the basement bathroom and we signed with the plumber last week to start the work - $10k.  Then we had our annual furnace inspection.  Inspector comes up the stairs and into the kitchen, ""You need a new furnace""  $9.2k.

So next week the plumbers will be here from Tues-Thurs and they will come install the new furnace on Wednesday.

This is home ownership.  You gotta know this is what you are signing up for.  There is no landlord to call.  This is why you save an emergency fund and buy less than you can afford (so you have some spare funds)

It sucks but at the end of the day our bathroom will be done and hopefully the new furnace will be quieter (old Furnace is a Lennox Pulse - google what those sound like if you are curious)",38,7,1087,201,0
Rabbie's Tours versus self-guided Highlands Roadtrip to see Scotland - experiences?,"My husband and I (both 30, from the US) are planning a late April/Early May trip to Scotland next year for about a week. We're debating on doing self-guided highlands roadtrip, renting a car and everything. I typically enjoy this type of planning but am mentally spent, and open to leaving it in the hands of experts. I've heard positive things about Rabbie's tours and appreciate the smaller group environment (I think I saw 16 people max?). A few questions:

* Does anyone have a preferred tour, either 3 days or 5 days, that would allow us to depart from and return to Edinbugh, while experiencing the Highlands? 
* What has been your general experience with Rabbie's overall... good enough to forgo a roadtrip? We're hoping to have some time to get a little hiking in, not sure if the tours will allow for this.
* What's the demographic or people like on this trip? I'm assuming they aren't a bunch of rowdy students.
* Lastly, I see there's an option to allow Rabbie's to select and book our accommodations for us. Rather than go through the hassle of picking one on our own - which is a hassle because we'd need to determine relative location, etc. - we aren't going to get stuck with some cruddy, dirty B&amp;B or hotel, would we?

Engineer Found Drainage Problem During Inspection Period,"I recently put in an offer on a house in South Florida that was accepted. The house was built in 2020 and looked great on the inside. My only problem with it was potential drainage issues outside. Long story short, I'm in my Inspection Period until next Monday and hired an engineer to come out and look at the property for drainage issues and discuss what I could do to resolve them. He advised that about $20k (minimum $15k) worth of work is needed to be done as there are clear violations of codes for the County (i.e., built to drain onto a neighbor's property, foundation too close to big trees, no drainage plan in place, etc.). Since the house is a new construction, it is not grandfathered in and therefore there's exposure for the violations of new codes.

  
The engineer is giving me a report stating that up to $35k worth of work needs to be done to resolve the issues, which will give me adequate room to negotiate down. My fear is that the Seller will take the report, say ""Okay don't buy it"" and then sell to someone else without telling them for the same price (thereby destroying any leverage I have). If they have the engineer's report detailing the violations and drainage issues, do they have to disclose it?

Denied Boarding Despite Meeting Transit Requirements,"I recently had a flight from Iceland to Singapore with Qatar Airways, with a layover in both London (Heathrow) and Doha. I have an Indian passport with a valid U.S. visa, and according to both Heathrow's website and the UK government's official website, I didn’t need a transit visa as I wasn’t required to go through UK immigration.

However, despite meeting all the requirements, Qatar Airways denied me boarding in Iceland. This forced me to book a last-minute one-way ticket, which was far more expensive and inconvenient.

Has anyone experienced a similar issue? Who should I approach for compensation—Qatar Airways or any other regulatory body? Also, would EU261 apply here, since the flight originated from Iceland? Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated!

So 350K is taxable (yikes).



I found a table that shows 0% 15% or 20% depending on my gross income.



If my gross income is 160K, do I have to add the 350K for taxable income 510K and putting me in 20% range (492k and higher) or is it only the 160K putting me in the 15% range n (44.6k to 492K)?

However, I'm being told that is not the case and the buyers still have to pay their agent. To me it seems this only hurts sellers instead of helping them because I would imagine most buyers are going to ask sellers to cover their fee too.

Airline Refuses to Refund Return Ticket After Canceling Departure - Feeling Cheated,"Hey everyone,

I’m in the UAE and I'm feeling super frustrated and could really use some advice. A few weeks ago, I booked a round-trip flight package to Beirut from Abu Dhabi through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) on Etihad Airlines. The airline ended up canceling my *departure flight* because of the situation in Lebanon right now and initiated the refund for that leg of the journey. However, they did **not cancel my return flight** and are now refusing to refund me for it.

They claim that because the tickets have **different reference numbers**, the return flight isn’t eligible for a refund. But when I booked, it was a package deal – I bought them *together* and wasn’t given the option to buy just one ticket. Now they’re saying the reference numbers are what matters, even though I never got the chance to buy these flights separately in the first place!

I feel like this is some sort of cheating as I won't be able to be in Beirut to actually go back on the returning  Any advice on how to get a refund for the return ticket that I obviously can’t use now?

"I am buying my first home, however the seller is caught in the hurricane and is no longer responding….","We put in an offer to which they countered and we accepted. We already had the inspection on Tuesday, we got back to them on Tuesday night with our two requests for them to fix or potentially take off the overall cost for us to fix it ourselves. 
Now it’s Friday and we haven’t heard back from them, their realtor let my realtor know they’re in the hurricane in North Carolina. (I’m in Missouri and the home I’m buying is here too) I’m super concerned for them and I’m also wondering how this affects us buying the home, what happens if they’re not okay and don’t respond to us? Do we lose the house or do we get to go through with getting the house but ultimately without repairs?

Transfer time for LAX,"Hello,

In a few months, I will be flying internationally for the first time. On December 28th, I will be flying out of SMF and into LAX with my brother via Southwest to transfer to terminal 7 and leave LAX on my international flight.

My SMF -&gt; LAX Flight is scheduled to be from 6:45AM to 8:20AM, to which then my second flight leaves at 11:30AM. These two flights are booked on separate tickets, and in every other connection I have more than enough time to transfer without any worry (the LAX to SMF return flight has a 6+ hour layover).

I'm aware that the terminal I would be arriving in LAX at, Southwest, is at the opposite side of where the United terminal lies, and that I additionally will need to collect and recheck baggage in my 3 hour window. Regardless, is this enough time to make it to my flight?

If I estimate that the flight is \~40 minutes delayed (meaning I am off the plane around 9AM), baggage collection takes \~30 minutes, and we take the \~15 minute walk outside of the airport to cross straight from Southwest to the United terminal (Both my brother and I are able to walk pretty quickly, there's no concern over exhaustion or anything), that would get us depositing luggage around 10AM (+15 minutes accounting for anything else). Then, we would have to get through security and be at the terminal within the remaining time.

I understand that this is a pretty optimistic timeline, and it should also be considered both that this will be early/late morning as well as extremely close to New Years where travel is likely going to be more frequent. With all that in mind, how risky is this decision? This is the earliest direct flight to LAX from SMF we could get.

Thank you!",21,4,1706,302,1

Buy the big house or wait?,"Ever since having our second child, our current starter home has been feeling too small. We've been looking for a bigger place for 9 months, but the market is such that there comes maybe one potential house per month available in the areas where we are looking.

We finally found a house that ticks every single box. We can afford it. The only problem? It's too big. It's so big it would be more suited to a family with 4 kids (we only have 2 and are not having more) or perhaps two families.

We're at a loss for what to do. Do we just buy the house, and if it feels too big maybe we can rent out part of it? However while we have small kids I feel this is not ideal as our tenants would have to put up with the noise. And we'd have to spend more money to convert the place... And always share our space with others... 

Or do we just wait and hope that something else will eventually turn up...? 

Anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice?



Edit to add relevant information: 

We are not in the states. There is no such thing as central heating or cooling here, so utilities would not be astronomical. Hiring help for cleaning and home / garden maintenance is affordable. All of this would make owning a slightly bigger home more feasible. 

But... This house is truly massive. I initially did not add the size because most people wouldn't be able to comprehend having this much space. Everything is big here, it's the norm. I'd say the average houses in the neighbourhood are around 4500 sq ft. This one is 5500 sq ft (includes a triple garage). Maybe this information would sway those saying to go for it in the other direction!

"Avis/Budget Rental - Fraudulent Charges Post Rental &amp; ""Nora Henry""","I recently rented a car from Budget near LGA airport and paid the rate for a hybrid. They gave me a mid-size SUV and refused to swap me into another car because ""you pre-paid and there's nothing we can do here since you paid Budget.com"".  Annoying enough but I figured I can contest with HQ. 

Issue is after the return. They tried to hit me with not one but two (so far) charges saying I damaged the car. First one was a ""spoiled"" interior claim. Second was a ""dent repair required"" claim, a full 1.5 weeks after the car was already returned. Both I had to get Budget HQ involved to waive because I had picture proof of no such damage - and the local franchisee apparently did not document the supposed spoilage/damage at all. 

I noticed that both letters came from ""Nora Henry"", working different positions every time (first was just some specialist title and the second time, she was magically with roadside assistance).

A google search tells me I'm not the only one who this has happened to.

So I was just wondering if more people had this happen to them? Should I expect more of these baseless accusations? How is there not a class action lawsuit against Budget/Avis for this bullshit they are pulling? It's taking us time and not to mention the mental energy to fight these fake charges they are trying to pull on consumers.

Seller agent and lawyer lied on transaction— recourse?,"I was working with my business partner to buy a rural property, and the seller’s attorney informed us this morning that the seller does not want to proceed with the transaction. There was no reason provided and no opportunity to counter with a different offer.

This is after the seller’s attorney, sent us a contract with wrong information, which my lawyers office had to send amendment to last Tuesday. She ignored our messages, and did not proceed with getting a corrected contract to us. The real estate agent on the transaction ignored our agent for days, and won’t even take our calls now. We feel EXTREMELY UPSET. The attorney even admitted that she knew LAST WEEK that the seller did not want to proceed, but kept that information.

We understand that the seller does not have to sell to us just because he accepted our offer.

House sale during divorce,"We are looking at a house for sale in which the couple is selling because of a divorce. The house is significantly overpriced. They bought it a couple of years ago according to house sigma and now have it listed for 500k more with nothing done to it since moving in. Looking at the pictures they have really let it go downhill in the short time they have owned it - like the shower tiling now needs to be replaced etc. 

According to their realtor the wife has moved out and wants to sell and the husband is still living there alone and doesn't, hence the overpricing. The realtor agreed it's over priced, has told them that and seemed exasperated that it was listed so high as well and said hopefully if it sits for a while with no showings etc that they will be willing to come down in price. 

I know in a divorce that a judge can order the sale of a house. Is there any sort of time frame that is usually given for that kind of thing where they would have to lower the price in say 6 months if they had no offers or can they just go on forever with it overpriced if the husband wants to keep living there?

Seller relisted but were under contract,"We attempted negotiations since the house appraised under slightly. The seller told her realtor she’d rather go back to market. We said okay, we’ll pay the gap. She then said she doesn’t want to do FHA repairs. We said okay, we switched to conventional. She then said she doesn’t want to pay concessions. Too bad, they’re in the contract. 

So today, they re-listed the house and stated it was no longer pending. This is not true, we’re under contract. My realtor is having their broker contact her realtor. 

This has been a nightmare. What do I even do now? 

Update: The sellers agent is the broker and has been contacted. They are remarking it pending and stated the seller “demanded” it relisted for backup offers. My agent reminded her we’ve performed and she is in breach. Funny enough that got her talking after being impossible to work with this entire time 
(I.e. utilities weren’t on for inspection, took until final day of option period for them to be turned on, and ignoring contact from my agent until the day before our final day. Ghosting my realtor for days throughout the entire process.) 

The agent stated she didn’t know we were moving forward and wasn’t informed we were changing from FHA to make the deal work. My agent sent her a screen shot of all his outgoing calls she ignored and texts she didn’t answer. 

Things appear to be back on track with 10 days to close. We’ll see. Thanks for the help everyone. 

Update 2: 4 days until closing the deal is dead. We switched to conventional to avoid the seller having to do repairs. Well, the seller refused to sign the paper that allowed us to use conventional instead of fha. Effectively killed the deal at the finish line because she doesn’t want to pay my realtor which she previously agreed to. Her realtor said she decided she’s going back to market and refusing to pay the buyers realtor, make repairs, or pay any concessions. She also is raising the price? Her realtor states she plans to release the listing since this seller is “clearly getting council from someone else” and has now killed an over asking over value deal. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ",39,6,2114,373,0

Title: Planning a 1-2 Year Solo Trip as an Indian — Visa Advice Needed!,"Hey everyone!

I’m an Indian traveler planning to kick off a 1-2 year solo backpacking adventure starting early next year. My idea is to begin in Europe, hop around for a few months, then head to South America, and eventually explore parts of Asia.

# Here’s a bit more about my plan:

* **Where I’m starting:** India (currently based here).
* **When I’m leaving:** Hoping to start around late November to early December. Pretty flexible on dates.
* **Budget:** Trying to keep it around $1,000-$1,500/month, give or take.
* **What I want to do:** I’m all about meeting locals, exploring hidden gems, and experiencing different cultures. Definitely want to mix city life with nature, maybe do some volunteering or work exchanges along the way too.
* **What I’ve figured out so far:** I know the Schengen visa only allows 90 days in 180 in Europe, which is going to be tricky. South America seems a bit easier, but I’m still figuring out the specific requirements. And Asia will probably be a mix depending on the country.

# My question:

Anyone else dealt with the whole visa issue as an Indian passport holder while trying to do long-term travel? How did you work around the restrictions, especially in Europe? Are there any countries that are more chill with long stays? I’d love to hear from anyone who’s navigated this or has some solid advice to share!

Also, if there are any fellow Indians who’ve managed to make a trip like this happen, I’d be super grateful to hear your experiences and how you tackled the visa stuff.

Thanks a lot, and safe travels!",71,13,1560,256,1
What kind of tap water filter should I buy? (under 20€ if possible),"Hello guys,

Home Improvement Questions,"We might be selling our house in the next year. It is 60/40 stay/sell.

The reasons don't matter - there is no exigent factor that requires either decision. It is kind of a love-it or list-it scenario.

Our current house is lovely - our neighborhood is coveted (houses sell in under 90 days when they take up to 270 around us). Our house is the 'cheapest' on the block of high-end, executive homes.

Our house was also the first build on our sought-after street, so we have been working on replacing the 1998 vibes since we bought it 10 years ago.

We would like to do some improvements -  that I want to start planning to do or just do, now. We have already modernized our roof, windows, door and fully painted the house in a more modern color scheme inside and out (very well done, to the point that people coming to visit us drive past our house thinking it isn't us).

It has tons of curb appeal - if when it looked less than fantastic in in 1990's hues.

I'd like some help to organize the improvement list to just prioritize spending and time - but also with highest return on investment toward the top of the list, so that if we do sell, it has at least some repayment. We will enjoy all of these improvements, so I'm really looking to optimize for \_potential\_ resale to just drive up square foot valuation, which our market does support, especially as the cheapest house in the nicest neighborhood.

Details: a farmhouse-style, 4 bedroom, 3 bath, 3000 sqft  + 30x15 large room-over fully hvac'd garage spare room and partially finished basement in 1000 sqft of the space. We use the room-over-garage as a 5th bedroom but that technically only counts as extra space due to being under a hipped roof area.

Yes, I will be working with a realtor at some point. We just don't know if we are ready to do that yet.

Here's our list:

1. replace our garage doors with insulated, carriage-style doors (this is actually #1 on my list) - question is do I get a)  'best' door that has three-layer (steel, foam, steel), R-18.4 with wood look, steel carriage-ish door - these still have the obvious garage door panel. b) Or, would a full-out faux carriage door four layer (still wood-look steel, we live in the NE and I wouldn't do a wood door) but that hides the garage door panel.
2. Kitchen Countertops - replace high-end orginal laminate with

* granite?
* quartz ?
* corian (not favored in our area, but I love corian)
* soapstone (my second fave)
* marble ?

1. resurfacing cabinets - our cabinetry is high-end and could be visually improved - I would consider doors and or professionally painting. \*\*I will move before living through a kitchen remodel/cabinet replacement. Seriously, that is my line in the sand.
2. Full master bedroom ensuite redo/redesign. Our house was designed by its builder to showcase his building, not designed - so our master bedroom windows look into our neighbors garage (they keep it much neater than we do ours!)  - and our WIC and master bath take up the full scenic view of our densely wooded, multi-acre private lot, and we have four doors in and out of this space. I have a plan, on this, an architect lined up to do stamped drawings, and would GC this with trades myself (have done this before). Square footage would not change - storage, reducing doors
3. Leave the ensuite setup as is- Master bathroom redesign. Ugh our bathroom is horrible c 1998 - awful jet tub that I would gladly host a bonfire in, just poorly designed.
4. install 2 egress windows in basement and fully finish about half the basement - will not take much - rough out of electrical is done - plumbing access is in place for a 1/2 or full bath. This is below grade so it would not be a full-valuation improvement, but would be able to be counted as 'finished basement'
5. laundry room improvement - kind of like a California Closets optimization to make the space more functional - includes a laundry Chute (which I love, but not sure if it is desired or a detriment)
6. replace upstairs carpeting with  hardwood -either in hallway (about 30 lf of hallway) OR hallway and bedrooms
7. improve bathroom 2 &amp; 3
8. replace septic system retooling - we have it cleaned and inspected (always passing) on the regular. It is just aged; and they fail. And, our state is eyeing this up as public health opportunity. Redoing it could support upgrading us to a 'legal'
9. outside rear yard improvement - currently our rear yard is basic, trees, fire pits, functional gardens that we don't really do much with. We could get a hard/landscaper in and make it wow - but is that worth it? currently a nice large deck with slider. I always envisioned a large bricked patio with shelter; just have never done it.
10. complete landscaping of front yard to remove and redesign walkways away from house, tear out and replant a 15 x 40 kidney shaped tree garden.
11. raise the roof over the garage (the roof is seperate from our main roof, so this would not require a complete reroofing or look bad due to the existing separation) to capture the full over-garage square footage adding in about 450 sq ft of above-grade living space.

Would love some expert opinion on prioritizing these of projects - in terms of potential payback if we sell (again, these are the things that will happen over the next few years anyway, if we stay - I will be happy with any of them, and if we go want to make it worth the money and time as much as possible).",26,3,5435,963,0
"The Underrated Gems of Cáceres &amp; Merída, Spain","Extremadura is a region in SW Spain that even Spaniards don't visit that much. I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of Cáceres and Merída. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Merída is only an hour away from Cáceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

Both cities are easily accessible by direct train from Madrid and Seville. I can't recommend them more highly!",50,8,1266,223,1
Commercial property that has house on it,"I am looking into a commercial property. It is a retail gift shop that can be used for lots of things. 

There is a house on the same parcel. It has the same address. The gift shop just has the letter A next to it. For example 1200 A. And the house is just 1200 next door. 

My question is, if I wanted to own and run a business out of the retail shop. Do I need to live in that house as my primary residence to do so? Or does it not matter what I do with the house?

I know I’ll get all the answers about checking with my local county/office regulations. I’m just asking if anyone knows off the top of their head.

Need advice on my Vietnam itinerary,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are planning a trip to Vietnam from January 30th to February 10th next year. We’ve already booked our tickets, which were a great deal, but I overlooked the fact that our trip coincides with the Tet celebrations. We’re feeling a bit anxious about how the first few days might go, so we’d love some feedback from anyone with more experience in Vietnam during this time.

Here’s our itinerary:

* **January 30:** Arrive at Hanoi airport, then take a private transfer to Tam Coc, Ninh Binh. We should arrive by 4 PM, so we’ll keep it low-key—grab a meal, walk around, and acclimatize after the flight.
* **January 31:** Spend the day exploring by boat and bicycle.
* **February 1:** Early morning private transfer to Phong Nha. Ideally, we’ll arrive by 2-3 PM. After that, we’ll grab a meal, cycle around, and take in the landscape.
* **February 2:** Visit Paradise Cave and Phong Nha Cave.
* **February 3:** Early morning private transfer to Hue, stopping at the Vinh Moc tunnels along the way. Once in Hue, we plan to visit the Imperial City and the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh.
* **February 4:** Transfer or take the train to Da Nang via the Hai Van Pass. In Da Nang, we’ll visit the Marble Mountains and, weather permitting, spend some time on the beach.
* **February 5:** Visit Ba Na Hills.
* **February 6:** Take a taxi to Hoi An, where we’ll explore the Old Town and relax at the beach.
* **February 7:** Visit My Son.
* **February 8:** Fly back to Hanoi. We’re planning to explore the Old Quarter and maybe do a pub tour or street food tour.
* **February 9:** Visit some museums in Hanoi.
* **February 10:** Visit local markets and do some souvenir shopping before our flight back to Europe in the evening.

We’re wondering if we’ll be able to arrange private transfers during Tet and whether the weather will be warm enough to enjoy the beaches in Da Nang and Hoi An at that time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",35,6,1958,326,1
Wrong E-visa vietnam,"I made a stupid mistake and didn't realize that vietnam has an option for a 90 day visa. Therefore I applied and got approved for a visa of 30 days (this was also the default amount of days).

Now I'm applying for the correct 90 days but it is the exact type visa (single entry) and price (25 USD). So now I'm wondering if my current visa would also be valid for 90 days but with the wrong exit date? On my approved visa it also says that the length of stay is subject to the immigration officer, so could it be that they will still give me the 90 day visa in my passport?",20,3,572,114,1

Trying to sell cigarette smokers house,"We bought a 2300 sq ft house that smelled strongly of cigarette smoke (the previous owner was still smoking in the house during walk through). We hired a professional “smoke remediation” cleaning company to clean the entire first floor and use ozone generators (1500 sq ft). The smell improved but was still strong. We used Zinser BIN two coats on all the walls and then a top coat, new countertops installed, new backsplash, cleaned and BIN painted cabinets, had wood floors and all windows professionally deep cleaned, ducts cleaned, all new lighting put in, and are in the process of cleaning and changing out all outlets. We also did an additional 24 hr ozone treatment, are about to do another one but much shorter. We had an attic fan installed. We also checked the attic insulation and luckily it does not smell. We sealed off the fireplace in case it was contributing to the smoke smell. We are thinking of buying new kitchen appliances too. Right now we’ve put in about $30,000 into all of this cleaning, not including the hours of work we’ve done ourselves. 
All of this and there is still a slight stale cigarette smell remaining. 
I’m at the end of my rope with this house and not sure what to do. It’s making me very depressed and anxious and feeling a lot of regret. We bought it in June and it’s now almost October and I’m unsure if it can be fixed or if we should just try to sell it after only a few months of living here and move on. I don’t want to lose a ton of money by selling it under what we paid for it also having put so much money into it ourselves or then having to sell it for less than we even bought it and only a few months later. 
We were advised that the professional restoration company and special paint would get rid of the smell, and obviously it did not. 
We thought we would be done with cleaning “renovations” in July, but that wasn’t the case. We have a baby on the way in October, so obviously we can’t sell and move this instant but looking for advice on what we should do in a few months. Should we keep trying to remediation the smell or should we start getting the house ready to sell? ",38,6,2133,400,0

Get through customs and there is the exit with 2 options - nothing to declare, and declare. To be safe I head over to the declare side, where the counter area is roped off.

So I ended up walking through with things I'm sure were fine to have, but wasn't able to declare anything.

"First Home, Home Inspection Results","Hey all, just looking for some insight. 

There’s a town house I’m looking to purchase that was built in 2018, interior unit. We did the inspection last night and some issues came up that I’m not sure if they are big or small. 

1) Lots of dry wall cracks. Some big (in length, not width), some small. Mostly running along the ceiling in straight lines but there was one horizontal crack in between two door frames that are side by side. There were two that ran in a straight line most of the length of their respective rooms. No discoloration so I assume the drywall just wasn’t installed right

2) Balcony door stick when opened 

3) a couple squeaky stairs

4) the dining room windows don’t lock properly, the lock is misaligned with the catch, so you can’t turn the switch all the way. 

5) there’s one spot on the roof where the flashing needs fixed 

6) stairs to the rooftop terrace are missing a handrail entirely, which is actually a code violation. 

7) On the rooftop terrace there are two carve outs for rain to drip down, however water is pooling right before the drain. So it appears that the terrace’s floor doesn’t have the grading that it should’ve. I’m not sure how big of an issue it is to fix that? 

8) In the attic, I’ll just quote the report… 

&gt; Tape joints on the fire separation wall are deteriorated / pealing. Fire barrier has been compromised, exposed joints with a gap. Recommend correction by a qualified contractor / handyman to maintain fire barrier. 

9) also attic, rusted nails indicating high humidity, recommended installing an attic fan 

10) some grouting needs to be redone in the bathroom. 


Does any of this sound horrific to anyone? Like a “run away” level of issues for a 5-6yr old townhome? It’s my first house, and while I understand every home has issues, I’m trying to make sure I’m not signing up for tens of thousands of dollars in repairs",35,5,1894,336,0
Critiques/suggestions - 3-week Mexico itinerary,"Hi there - my partner and I are visiting Mexico from mid Nov to early Dec! We will be there for just over 3 weeks, which hopefully gives us enough time to explore 2-3 regions and have a good variety of experiences (cities, beaches, etc.). This is our high-level itinerary so far:

**Days 1-5: Mexico City**

* Including day trip to Teotihuacán

**Days 5-8: Bacalar** (fly to Chetumal from Mexico City, then bus to Bacalar)

**Days 8-11: Valladodid** (ADO bus from Bacalar)

* Including day trips to Chichén Itzá/Rosalia Chay Chuc/cenotes)

**Days 11-14: Merida** (ADO bus from Valladodid)

* Including day trips to Uxmal/Ek-Balam/cenotes

**Days 14-17: Oaxaca City** (fly from Merida)

* Including day trips to a mezcalería/Monte Albán/Hierve el Agua/Pueblos Mancomunados

**Days 17-21: Puerto Escondido** (ADO bus from Oaxaca)

* Including day trips to Mazunte/Zipolite/Chacahua National Park

**Days 21-23: Mexico City**

Have done quite a lot of research but wanted to check with those in the know if this itinerary makes sense or if we've missed anything! Some specific notes/questions:

* We've booked flights in and out of Mexico City (from Europe), besides that pretty open so far
* Have already cut a few places out (e.g. Puebla/Cholula) so the trip feels relaxing, but is this still too much? Or anything amazing missing?
* Don't plan to hire a car - happy to do it, but it doesn't seem necessary for the places we're visiting?
* We like exploring cities and walking (museums, markets, etc.), LOVE food and drink, and appreciate natural beauty
* Want some beach time but not into all-inclusive resorts/sleepy towns with nothing else to do - so thought Puerto Escondido/Bacalar were good options (aware Bacalar is not a beach, but think it counts as lazing by the water vibes)
* For beach we also considered Holbox (but were put off by bad reviews of sewage problems/flooding, power outages, mosquitoes, bad service, etc.) and Isla Mujeres/Cozumel (but hear they are too touristy/similar to Cancun/Tulum) - any other perspectives on this?
* Neither of us are particularly into archaeology/visiting ruins - does this mean we have too much time in Merida/Valladolid? Thinking we might just visit 1 or 2 of Chichén Itzá/Uxmal/Ek Balam and not all of them (similarly with the cenotes)
* We also briefly considered doing Jalisco (Guadalajara, Tequila, Puerto Vallarta, etc.) instead of Yucatan

Some hesitation to put an offer on a SFH that's been on the market for 2 months,"I'm considering making an offer for a listing that's been in the market for almost 2 months -- quite rare in this neighborhood, and in this city (Ann Arbor), which is still a seller's market even in the past 1-2 years when rates went up. For full transparency, here's a screenshot of the listing (don't want to type the address otherwise it'll show up in search engines) if you want to look at pics on zillow:  [https://imgur.com/g4ipCdh](https://imgur.com/g4ipCdh)

My realtor said this was way overpriced to begin with. Was initially priced at 1.4m, and they recently adjusted it to 1.3m, but it's still way too high. My realtor's CMA (which I understand is based on very limited data points) suggests $950k -- for reference, the vast majority of SFHs in that neighborhood of Ann Arbor is over $1m and quite old (built before 1950s).

The seller's agent has received no offers, and said the main complaints from other buyers were that they didn't like the layout, which my realtor and I surmised is because:

1. Many stairs. Most potential buyers are in their 40s &amp; 50s. I don't mind at all because I'm 32 and the oldest in my family, and we will likely leave Ann Arbor when our little one goes to college (in \~ 10 years).
2. The primary bedroom bathroom has a strange arrangement (you can see part of it from the pictures), but it's not a dealbreaker to me. It's just an oddly shaped bathroom. I might want to redesign part of it.
3. The basement bathroom has a very tiny shower. Quite frankly, I don't know what in the world they were thinking with that design.
4. There are 2 sets of stairs to the second floor. One of the bedrooms is unreachable from the primary bedroom unless you go through another bedroom. That's not a big deal to me.

These are the main complaints with the layout, I think. I would be happy living here, but I can't help but feel that from an investment perspective, it'll be hard to resell down the line for the same reasons as now, but who knows what's going to happen in 10 years...

Any words of wisdom for a first time homebuyer?

Also, note that I have a lease through the end of May, so I'm not in a rush. So I still have a little over 8 months, but also note that there are very few listings in that neighborhood historically, and even less that are suitable for my family -- I do anticipate a few interesting listings will show up in the next 8 months, but no guarantees on that front. Also my realtor said spring time is when there's far more competition, and ""deals"" for the buyer usually happens late in the calendar year (around November &amp; December), so I don't have a lot of competition currently.",79,17,2648,474,0

Traveling to Tijuana from San Diego,"Hi Reddit,

"If the new DOJ agreements have an impact on prices, how long will it take to see results?","Obviously, it would be hard to say exactly, because of prices go up for other reasons or down for other reasons It's hard to know. But I'm sure experts and economists can isolate different variables and have an idea. In Washington, we don't participate in that agreement with our NWMLS, Northwest multiple listing service. But, it's certainly been in the news and we've been making sellers aware of the negotiability of commissions for years. As far as I can see, people are still offering two and a half to 3%, with a few 2% on higher ends here and there. 

Personally, I think it's a big tempest in a teapot and wasn't really a problem in the first place and will not bring prices down or stop them from going up. But that's just me .

"Da Nang,Vietnam for 8 months ","Last year we have left the beautiful place called Da Nang where my boyfriend and I spent incredible 8 months.We decided to move to Vietnam just for a month and ended up staying longer than we thought we would.
The city itself has a lovely beach that has white sand and adorable little crabs that I enjoyed looking at.
It is less crowded than Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City which makes it perfect for people who like nature but also want to have some activities and modern city environment.
Together with that, Da Nang has a lot of foreigners and we ended up going to different events from Halloween to Holi festival where we had a great time and met new friends.Vietnamese people are also quite friendly and very kind,we felt really comfortable and welcomed there.
There are a lot of restaurants and cafes that offer a lot of different cuisines and dishes.We have tried Vietnamese and other cuisines,and there is also a night market in the city where you can try a lot of fresh seafood.
It was easy to move around the city since we rented a bike,so we were able to explore a lot of places in and around Da Nang.There are a lot of cool things to see,but for us the most memorable places were:

2.Marble mountains

Getting Mortgage for homes well above appraisal,"I'm interested in buying a manufactured home in NH that was appraised at $100,800 in 2020. Since then, it's received a bathroom renovation, a new oven and burner, and a new fridge, but otherwise remained mostly unchanged.

Now, the price has raised to $142,000, and while I was pre-qualified for well over that, I'm concerned about getting a mortgage for the property at that price.

  
With the current market, do lenders go over the appraised price significantly? Would it be worth hiring an appraiser to estimate a more up-to-date price?",47,7,540,90,0

Iceland for new years eve advice,"Hello all. Recently decided to go solo travelling for new years eve this year and I'm trying to decide where to visit.

[CA] Purchasing a home by Sheriffs Sale ( judicial foreclosure),"I am a tenant in a home scheduled to be sold by auction in California. It is a judicial foreclosure from a court case brought by a junior lien holder for a debt. The primary lien (mortgage) will get paid first, but are otherwise not involved.  

There are different provisions in a judicial foreclosure, such as a minimum value for auction, and a homeowner’s right of redemption period after the sale (3 months or 1 year in most circumstances.) 

If someone is interested in bidding at the auction, can they find out anything about the redemption period, or if other liens behind this one will survive the levy? 

Seems risky as a buyer to pay cash and not know if you have to wait a year to apply for title. That’s why I’m wondering how a buyer would research that information I so I can do the same thing. I have all the court filings and information about the liens, but they do not address this. 

Anyone with experience in this realm who can offer advice would be so appreciated. 

Edit: I reworded my original post -  this isn’t a bank foreclosure by a lender. ",63,10,1067,198,0
What is the real value of the guest house?,"My husband and I got divorced about four years ago, and we have a unique living situation. We live in Florida on a property with two houses: the main house and a detached guest house. It’s important to note that the property is assessed as a whole, based on the entire 1 acre of land, rather than evaluating each house separately.

Since we have one child together, we agreed in our divorce settlement that I would stay in the guest house so I could be close and regularly see my daughter. However, I’ve actually been living in the main house with my ex-husband (I rent a room there for a low cost) and renting out the guest house for $2,300 a month, which covers more than my living expenses. I believe part of a home’s value comes from the income it generates.

About a year ago, my ex-husband started pressuring me to give him half of the rental income from the guest house, even though it was well after our divorce settlement. I eventually agreed, and we modified the divorce agreement.

Now, he wants to buy out my share of the property for a very low price of $52,000. Given the rental income, that amount feels insignificant—I could earn that much in just a couple of years. Plus, in the last three years, I’ve replaced all the appliances, the roof, A/C, septic system, and fence.

A recent appraisal of the entire property came in at $657,000. My ex-husband hired an appraiser to evaluate the guest house, but the appraiser only looked at comparable properties nearby instead of assessing its actual value.

Now my ex is threatening to sell the whole property if I don’t agree to sell it to him for $52,000. I’m trying to figure out a few things:

EU and Schengen travel ban with travel thereafter ,"Hi there. 

History (short). 
I moved to live in Malta (UK Citizen from birth). Once landed I started my residency process/paperwork (I had arranged a long term rental contract, sorted private medical, arranged a car etc etc) I engaged with Grant Thornton to assist me through this, also at a large cost. I was not at all trying to take the piss. 
The process was still ongoing for over a year and a half and at that point, had to travel back to the UK for work. When leaving Malta, and at the airport, was given a photocopied piece of paper stating I was banned from entering the “European Union and Schengen countries”. This ban was to be in effect for 3 years. 

However, Would I be able to visit Montenegro as it’s not an EU member nor is it in the Schengen?

Backing out of home purchase on the day of closing,"It's to early to call my lawyer so I figured, why not post on reddit!

I find myself in an incredibly embarrassing position. After spending 5 months on the home buying process of a specific location, I am now at the day of closing and a wrench has been thrown into the system.

You see Reddit, I was motivated to buy a two family home to give my parents (and disabled brother) a more secure place to live.  They currently rent, and don't make much money.  Father is retired, mother makes 20k a yr (if that).

The intention was for my family to live downstairs and myself to live upstairs.  We found a property that, while on the smaller side, seemed to fit our needs.  Throughout this whole home buying process we ran into every snag imaginable but here we are now ready to finalize everything.

Yesterday we did our final walk through. It was me and my mother.  This was not her first time seeing the property.  However now she suddenly had so many criticisms.  Up until this point she had remained happy and looking forward to moving. I had asked her more times than I can count if this is something she wants and the answer was always yes.

Last night she unloaded how unhappy she is with the place and how much she hates it and doesn't want to move.  80% of the purpose of buying a home was for her.  As you can imagine, this has definitely knocked the wind out of my sails.  It ended up turning into a huge fight with me asking why didn't she say anything sooner. The situation is bleak now and I no longer have any interest in purchasing the home.

So, what does this all mean for me? I realize I will lose my good faith deposit (5k) but what else am I potentially looking at if I attempted to back out now?

I'm just so angry and embarrassed and wish I never did any of this.





UPDATE: I BOUGHT THE HOUSE EVERYONE! I appreciate all of your input.  It really helped put things into perspective!  I shouldn't let her feelings impact my decision (even if my initial decision to buy a house revolved around her 😅).  If she doesn't want to move in, that's her choice and I will simply rent the unit out.",50,10,2108,401,0

Grand Canyon Sept. 2025 and bringing 65 year old dad - Airports and Duration Questions,"Hi - So, I've done most but not all of my homework, including the NPS site, \~2 dozen reddit posts and a few YT videos.  I'm looking for some additional guidance on optimizing our trip and making sure that we are not forced to rush around.

**Trip Objective and Background:**   
GC has always been on my dad's list, we were initially planning to do the 3day river trip offered by Western Expeditions, but I'm too concerned with my dad's health to put us in a position like that. He's not obese, but he has a heart condition and we just do not want to put ourselves in that type of situation if we can avoid it.   
  
The objective is to optimize for shorter, less strenuous hikes, helicopter tours, mule rides and other activities where the physical activity is limited in time (say &lt;3hours) and in strain (limited elevation gain, dicey pathways, etc).  We are very much into scenic drives, I'm not concerned with the 4-5 hour drive between the SR and NR, for example.  If there are opportunities for catch &amp; release fly fishing, even better.

We are very interested in Phoenix, Sedona, Flagstaff and even Page.  Vegas is less of a thing for us, but if it makes sense to fly in/out of Vegas, then so be it.  We fully intend on renting a car, if that isn't obvious.  We don't really drink but we very much enjoy a good meal, so I'd prioritize the towns/cities offering more in the way of food over say bars and nightlife.

I realize that there are other opportunities for parks, such as heading into Utah, and while that is certainly appealing my main goal is to get my dad to see the GC.

**Trip Dates and Duration:**   
We are targeting early September 2025, we are flexible and can bring in to August but September is preferred.  We'd like to stick to 3-4 days, say we land on a Thursday morning and then fly out on a Sunday evening.

**Accommodations:**   
Traditional lodging but we are certainly interested in a non-primitive camping option, if it makes sense.   

**The information I am most interested in right now:**  
1) Given the above, what is the most ideal flight plan, where to fly into, where to fly out of?  Currently thinking fly in to Vegas, then depart from Phoenix.  Not opposed to using the same airport if it makes more sense.  
  
2) Should we plan for 3 nights, 4 days (Thur, Fri, Sat night, leave Sunday afternoon)? Is this enough time given our objectives?  Say 2 nights in/around the canyon with the remainder spread between the other locations (Sedona, Flagstaff, etc...)

3) Is there a compelling reason to go towards end of Aug, early Sept versus end of Sept?

Brussels - is it as bad as they say? Has anyone enjoyed it?,"So looking to travel to Europe as an American next summer and trying to do some planning. I've been to the UK and a few eastern/central European countries before (and loved it). I'm not one to be starry eyed about places and neither am I one to be overly critical of places. Looking at countries (and cities/regions/places) I haven't been to, the consensus seems to be everywhere in Europe north of Spain / Italy (and west of the old iron curtain) is amazing and anything negative you heard about a place is because the people visiting did it wrong. The one exception I come across is Brussels. Tourists, residents, ""travelers"", everyone seems to hate Brussels and act like it has no redeeming qualities. 

Places in southern Europe like Barcelona and Venice and Rome seem to be split in people's opinions. Places in northern Europe seem to be either universally loved, or when visitors say they had a bad experience, people tend to push the bad experience back on to the visitors themselves (in other words - I expect the pushback on my comment to be that ""plenty of people complain about Paris"" or wherever, but this pushback is going to come from people who really like Paris / disagree with the criticism itself and say the bad experience only happened because the traveler ""did it wrong"" vs. when someone criticizes Venice, people who like it say ""it's not for everyone / it has it's problems but i love it"".) (All just in my experience and I realize reading reviews online and watching travel YouTube videos only does so much. Which is why I'm asking the question here).

Anywho, all this provides context to say that my research shows Brussels seems to be universally hated, and this seems to be unique for Europe (especially ""western Europe outside the UK""). Usually people will make travel YouTube videos like - ""Is (Insert City Here) as bad as they say?"" And then go on to talk about the good things of the city (if only to be quirky and different as a content creator). But I've seen videos of people asking this question about Brussels and then being like yup, it's bad.

For context, I'm from the rustbelt in the US, so watching the videos, and seeing some of the things that people don't like in Brussels wouldn't bother me (like things like it being run down or people ""feeling uncomfortable""). But I'm also not there in person, so who really knows.

So has anyone been to Brussels and enjoyed it? Are there redeeming qualities? I almost want to go out of curiosity but only have so much time and money to spend, and don't want to be super disappointed / feel like I should have invested limited time/money/energy resources elsewhere. Also not really looking for ""instead of Brussels, try Ghent"" type responses. Those seem to be as universal as the hatred of Brussels. Just trying to see if there are redeemable qualities in Brussels that would at least help me feel less guilty of ""pressing the red button"" out of curiosity and going there instead of somewhere else.

Advice on travel itinerary - SEA + LatAm,"Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 5-6 month trip from February next year. Our current itinerary is this with number of days we plan to stay in each country/city in brackets: 
- Argentina (14) / Brazil (14) / Taiwan (7) / Singapore (3-4) / Malaysia (14) / Thailand (21) / Cambodia (7) / Vietnam (21) / Seoul (10) / Japan (14) / Indonesia (30-42) / Dubai (3-4) / London (home) 

Couple of considerations 
- We don’t want to go to Japan or Korea when it’s cold hence why we’re not going there at the start of our trip 
- We want to spend 4-6 weeks in Indonesia as family will come and meet us there hence why it’s the last leg before a couple of days of luxury in Dubai. 
- We really want to spend some time in both LatAm and SEA. 
- We’re late 20s / early 30s, aiming to go for mid-high end hotels. Not keen on slumming it though open to nice hostels with private rooms and bathrooms. 
- Also planning to take trains/buses where doable, e.g from Malaysia to Thailand, or across Vietnam. 

Questions for you:
- Do you think the itinerary is doable?
- Is there an easier way to travel between South America and Asia (ideally Taiwan but could be HK or Singapore). At the moment it’s a 35-40hour flight inc layovers. We don’t want to do this in eco so are looking at business and it’s £4k roughly per person. 
- We ideally don’t want to spend more than £20k each. Is that feasible? Our international flights right now total about £8-9k per person. 
- Any country we should do away with or anything we’ve missed?

Connecting through Singapore Changi. Diff airlines / bookings / terminals. Do we need to clear customs / immigration?,"Hello friends, 

I looked through the layover FAQ but it doesn't have much regarding self transfers so I hope I can ask here.

We need some help. So we just booked flights into and out of Singapore / Changi for the start of our big Asia trip but had to use separate airlines and book separately due to cost. Coming into SIN on Japan Airlines, into Terminal 1 and leaving on Singapore Airlines out of Terminal 2. We have US Passports.

The big worry is we have maybe 2.5 hours. First, does anyone know for sure whether we can go from T1 to T2 without having to clear customs? Second, if we don't have to clear customs, will we still need to re-clear security? Does anyone know how long you think this will take at roughly 8:00 AM on a normal day?

We don't know if we will be checking luggage. We probably will. If anyone has knowledge / experience, can you let us know what to expect in either case? Checked vs carryon only?

My wife is in a bit of a panic about this as we didn't take this into account when choosing flights. Changing flights to leave us more time in between will cost more than we have in the budget.

Iberia nightmare for name correction,"Ok guys, I'm having a nightmare with Iberia.

My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",88,16,2007,298,1
Planning a trip for March 2025 for up to two weeks; Suggested destinations?,"Title. I reside in Seattle, WA

March 2025 is when I'll be done with my grad school program, and as a reward I want to go on a solo travel for up to two weeks. I have several destinations that I have in mind and things I want to do there, and wanted to get estimates on how long it would take me for the stuff I want to do plus anything else you guys might suggest. I added ? at the end of how long I wanted to stay there, because they are all my estimations. I plan to get a Hotel and a rental car (if possible) for all these locations

**1. Hawaii (6 days)**

I always wanted to go there, and things I want to do are:

* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours/hiking (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* Local food/drinks

I was thinking about spreading these activities across the islands instead of trying to do all of them on the main one

**2. Rome/other cities in Italy? (5 days? 1 week?)**

I plan to stay just in the city or stay close to it. Most of the activities I wanted to do are sightseeing and visit those historic sights and museums. Also food. Definitely food lol.

Rome definitely will be my primary destination, but I also want to check out other cities such as Florence, Tuscany, or Sicily. I did consider Venice once, but I heard it's suffering from overtourism and they initiated some sort of restrictions? If they are fine with just a single traveller, than I would add that to my list. So things I would want to do are

* Tour Rome and Vatican City on Vespa
* Visitng historic monuments and sites
   * Colosseum, Pantheon, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, etc
* Eat lots of pasta/pizza
   * Or take cooking class learning to make one
* Wine tasting
* Boat rides in Venice
* Rome catacomb tour
* Other stuff that I can do in Tuscany/Sicily?

**3. UK (1.5 weeks?)**

At first I wanted to stay just in the England/London area and check out all the famous landmarks (London Bridge, Big Ben, The Parliment, Buckingham Palace, etc), then visit Oxford and Cambridge, followed by visiting the white cliffs and Stonehenge. But then I got curious on things to do in Scotland as well; How easy is it to travel from England to Scotland? Definitely considering visiting Mary King's Close in Edinburgh, but what else to do? Full list of what I'd want to do would be:

* Visiting all those locations I've mentioned
* Go to Scotland if it's easy to enter
* Visit one of the castles
* Fish and Chips
* Ride the London Eye
* Visit the British museum
* The Scottish highlands, Wales, the Lake District, Cornwall, the Cotswolds

**4. Japan (1.5 weeks?)**

Similiar to UK, I wanted to stay in Toyko initially, But I feel there's so much to explore in Japan. Really want to fit in time to visit an onsen at least for two days, and do stuff between Toyko and Osaka? Full list of things I want to do:

* Eat tons of sushi, ramen, curry, tempura bowls, and even a fugu sashimi
* Visit to Studio Ghibli Museum
* Visit to Tokyo tower
* Shibuya
* Onsen Trip, as I mentioned
* Shopping for some tax-free items cheaper compare to US; Maybe a Gundam Figure build kit or a Gibson Guitar?",75,13,3186,559,1

"8 days in Spain, starting and ending in Madrid - is that enough time to visit another city or should I just stick to Madrid and its surrounding towns?","I’m planning some solo travel around a work trip to Madrid next week and I want to use my time effectively. This will be my first time in Spain and I’m currently torn between two options:

1.	Split my time evenly between Madrid and another city - I’m thinking Barcelona, Valencia, or Seville, or even crossing into Porto (though I’ve been there before)
2.	Stay in Madrid for the full week and take day/overnight trips to surrounding towns (Toledo, Sergovia, Salamanca).

My first day off will be next Friday (11/10) and my flight home from Madrid to London is 3pm the next Saturday (19/10). I’ve heard that 8 days is too much time for Madrid but I’m worried that things will be too rushed if I visit a second city but only spend 4 days in each.

Because of the flight schedule, I must start and end the trip in Madrid. I like walking and street photography, and I can speak basic Spanish. I also want to keep costs low so I’ll probably be staying in hostels for the entire trip.

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations?",150,29,1027,181,1
2+ weeks in Guatemala and Belize,"Hi,

I am trying to plan a 2-week (18 days) trip around New Year to Guatemala and Belize, but I can't figure out the order of places to visit as the travel time between places is very long.

So far my draft looks like this:

Day 1 - Fly to Guatemala City- drive to Antigua

Day 2-3 - Antigua

Day 4-5 Acetenango

Day 6-9 - Lake Atitlan

Day 10-11 - Flores/Tikal

Day 12-16 - Belize

Day 17-18 - trip back home

What doesn't make sense to me is the trip from Atitlan to Flores as it's a 10-12 hours journey. But then it makes sense to get from Flores to Belize.

I can't change where I fly to and from, but would like to end in Belize and leave the beach as the last part (if I have to spend a day in a city with an airport, that's also ok).

Would you amend the time spend in any of the placea above? I hear mixed opinions about Semuc Champey so skipped it as it's a long journey.

Airline charged extra for baggage despite it being included in the ticket price,"Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I took a book bag on an international flight with Norse airlines from JFK, NY to Rome in July 2024. 

The bag was perfectly within the allowance of the airline's carry-on policy. I was not charged extra on the original flight. However, when I checked in for my return flight, the agent insisted that my book bag was not included for free. He basically stated that I had absolutely no baggage allowance according to the system although I had purchased a ticket where one carry-on item plus one personal item was included for free. I had the exact same bag with the exact same weight and size that I had used on my original flight.

The agent did NOT weigh or check my book bag's size whatsoever. He eyeballed it and decided to charge me $75 or else I would not be allowed to take my bag on the flight as a carry-on.

I reported this to the airline but they simply replied this: ***'It is the passenger's responsibility to make sure that the bag fits the allowance. Upon the check in counter the agent has to make sure that the dimensions/weight is respected. If the employee determines that a bag is not within the allowance either by its weight or its size, a charge will apply. We are not able to come back on an agent decision, sorry***.'

So, in a nutshell: the agent is God and determines who should pay extra and who should not and the airline has very little to do with this decision and can't do anything about it once it has been made.

I am sorry, but in many other industries. or areas of life, this would constitute a racket/ fraud for various reasons (the impunity of the agent even if a mistake is made, the fact that the bag was not even properly checked for size and the will nilly decision to charge me for something that is supposed to be included in the ticket price and no way of claiming my money back).

Any advice on what I can do about getting the baggage fee back?",79,13,1936,353,1

Advice on Machu Picchu Tours ,"Hi all, I am planning on being in Cusco around mid November for Machu Picchu.

Traveling to Vietnam in Dec - Question on Overnight trains,"Hello, travelling to Vietnam in December. My tour operator previously had a domestic flight from Nha Trang to Hoi An on their itinerary which has now been changed to an overnight train journey. I’m concerned about safety and comfort of these overnight trains. Do they disrupt sleep? I understand I’ll be sharing a cabin with traveller from the same tour operator. I’ve seen other tourists on the operator’s website (Contiki) say the overnight train was “awful” and “painful, horrible”.

This change has been really inconvenient for me because we were told only much later after booking the trip and after I had purchased international flights to Vietnam, so I either lose what the money I pay for the international flight by not going at all or suffer overnight on a train.

Lot hidden from country records,"I was looking at buying a lot, and in my research ended up looking at the lot next to it.

We found mention to the owner in a RoW document filed with the county and our realtor made contact with him.

"First time home buyer, inspections weren't good","It's a house built in 1970 and it has the kind of problems you'd expect. 

Major issues include a failing sewer pipe that couldn't be inspected all the way to the street because of roots, termites and dry rot in fascia and some corvals on the exterior, an installation error on the fireplace that's creating a fire hazard, and a leak in the garage. The general home inspector also noted some aluminum wiring that wasn't installed correctly that's convinced me it needs an electrical inspection too. 

All told before I've had an electrical inspection, I've been quoted $18k for repairs. Given I know there's at least some aluminum wiring, I expect that number to go higher. Despite all this the inspectors were generally very positive for a house this old.

We absolutely love the house and the property, but this is intimidating. My realtor is suggesting that we ask them to either cover closing costs or reduce the sale price of the home so that we don't need to risk the current owner making the cheapest possible repairs. I'm inclined to agree, and I guess here's the part where I'm asking for advice. Covering closing costs seems wise since that leaves us with cash in hand to address these problems ourselves, but is this too much to take on for a first time home buyer?

Update:

Huge thanks to everyone that replied, you folks have really helped to shape the conversations I've been having with my realtor and given me confidence (and some reasonable doubts) about moving forward on this house.

Well, we're doing it. I just got through with an electrical inspection where we walked through all of the issues that the general inspector noted and then some. The short version is that it does have aluminum wiring throughout and the aluminum is incorrectly spliced with copper, both at the breaker box and behind every outlet. There are a few areas where it's clear that new wiring was added as copper as well, so that needs to be chased down and addressed at the point where the splice occurs. 

Good news: we have a plan to address the fire hazards and bring it to a livable standard. He had other recommendations to make as well, up to and including a rewire, but just to address the safety hazards he put is in the ballpark of $3500. He's going to get back to us with an actual quote but that was based on a house nearby that was the same size where he just completed the same exact job. I trust the guy; I know him by reputation and he's gotten a really strong recommendation from someone I trust who has worked with him in the past.

I'm not taking a rewire off the table, it's definitely something that I intend to address in the time that we're living there, but it's no longer got me worrying about whether we'll be able to close on the house burning down.

Worth it to fix leaning garage?,"I have a large two-story detached garage that’s leaning to the point of being unsafe to enter. It's about 2,100 square feet, and I’ve been quoted $100K to fix the lean. Does this seem like a reasonable estimate, and would it be worth it in terms of return on investment?



I’m torn because I feel that the garage adds a lot of value to the property. If we tear it down, we'd also need to do quite a bit of electrical work since it’s connected to our driveway lights with 220V power running to its panel. The lower level has high ceilings, making it ideal for an auto shop, and the upper level is insulated. With plumbing and heat, it could even be converted into an auxiliary living space.

Should we do a joint mortgage or a trust?,"My parents live with me. We have to purchase a house, they want me to be able to continue living in it indefinitely when they pass.

Background: My parents are elderly and not well, they have a lot of medical issues and one of them is developing dementia. I have been their caretaker for decades and live with them. I've helped with the house payment (made most of it actually, except for taxes and insurance) which I was happy to do because I can't qualify for much of a mortgage (student loans, I have to work from home to care for my parents and that affected how much I can earn/pay). Their last house ruined our credit (overextended repairing things the inspector missed) and while we were preparing to claim bankruptcy on those credit cards a hurricane destroyed our house with a tree. It was insured and we were able to sell the remains/lot. We have to buy a new house in the next 6 months and we now have funds for a significant down payment. We're trying to keep the mortgage amount below 25% of the price of the house. They are not currently on Medicaid but there is always the possibility something catastrophic could happen any day and they don't want medicaid to make me homeless, but I don't want them to refuse care because their worried about the house. I do have a sibling but they are not close with my parents and the house is my parent's only significant asset so they are only in the will for things like pictures we saved. Would it be better to have a joint mortgage with the 3 of us on it, or would it be better to have it in their names and have some sort of trust set up?

Redfin hiding Buyer Brokerage Commission ,"Redfin until just recently put the buyer's broker commission front and center on the website. Now it's at the very bottom under the ""other"" tab renamed as selling agency compensation. 

Classic Redfin move. They want to make it harder for consumers to differentiate one listing offering a buyer brokerage compensation and one that does not.  Their seller clients are more inclined to offer a lower compensation or no compensation to the buyer. This means that their listings actually will cost the buyer more than one that offers to pay the buyer's broker. So they want to hide that from you now.

Help please,"Hi, I'm buying a house and closing on it this October 24th which seems to have gone by pretty quickly, but as we get closer my realtor and I agreed to put on the offer a credit of 3000 for the repairs that need to be done such as the rust and barnacles that were found on the pipes, the missing handrail, etc. So I asked today if they had responded to the offer and my realtor said that the sellers haven't responded and that he's pretty sure they're out trying to fix the things I told them not to worry about.

Denied Boarding - boarding pass was still valid,"Hi everyone,
My original flight was from LIS to MAD to DFW to IAH. 

Sept 26
I arrived at the airport at 9am for my 12pm flight. My boarding pass got me through security just fine. 

My LIS -&gt; MAD flight got delayed by 2 hrs, which would’ve caused me to miss my flight from Madrid to DFW. I didn’t think too much of it, and assumed I would be rebooked on the next available flight out of MAD.

I show up to the gate to board, and when the gate agent scans my boarding pass, an error shows up. 

Turns out Iberian (or American Airlines) had changed my itinerary completely to a new flight with United…that had already left 2 hrs ago, so I was denied boarding. 

I was confused since I had not been notified through the app, and my booking confirmation was still valid through American. Everything remained the same. I called American and waited on their callback list and never received one. I also called Capital One Travel, and everything looked the same on their end. I finally talked to Iberian, and they said they couldn’t just rebook me for another flight since American was responsible for the flight.

I checked my spam email randomly - didn’t even think too much of it - and found that Iberian Airlines had sent me a pdf file stating I needed to check in for my new flight (the flight i was supposed to be on).

Email was sent at 7am.

Because I needed to go back home, Capital One booked me a one-way flight for $1400 the next day. :(

I’m just confused since I have yet to talk to AA - what happened? How did my pass get me through despite not even being registered for that flight? Why was my original itinerary not updated?

Singapore vs US/UK/Canada for a first-time solo female traveller. A matter of waiting a budget.,"I'm from South Africa, and want to start saving and planning for an international holiday. The only time I've ever left the country was in 2005 as a 10-year-old to go to Taiwan on a school trip. While my heart wants to go to the US or UK the most, there are so many hurdles to that. Firstly, there are staunch visa requirements for us, and as a self-employed freelancer with no kids or assets, visas are even harder to get for me. It's doable, but it would involve spending way more money because I'd have to go for interviews at the consulate, which would mean flights or long road trips in itself because I'm nowhere near any of those visa offices. So, money is obviously the biggest factor for that, coupled with our way lower exchange rate, I'd have to save for at least 2 years to go on a worthwhile trip. I'd want to be there for at least 2-3 weeks so I can explore as much as possible given the size of the country, but ideally a month. The same goes for Canada and the UK.

OR, I could go to Singapore (where I don't need a visa), and even though it's also expensive, it has a lot of western influence and I feel like it's as close as I could get to the US without visa requirements. I could spend a week in Singapore and only have to save up for around 6 months. It just kinda feels disingenuous to go to a culture-rich destination like that when I'm not really interested in the local culture, cuisine, etc. I'd be going to go to Universal Studios, try Five Guys and Shake Shack, visit IKEA, the zoo, super trees, sky walk, and their train system (I love trains) and maybe some sightseeing bus tours.

Which road would you take?",95,15,1638,310,1
What northern part of Italy I must visit in 4-5 days?,"Hello travelers!

I’m planning a trip to Italy but need help figuring out which cities are must-visits. I plan to stay in Florence for 2 nights, but I’m unsure about the rest of my itinerary. I generally prefer not to stay more than 2 nights in any city.

I’m having some trouble finding an affordable flight or bus from Edinburgh to Florence, so I may need to stop over somewhere in Italy. Since Florence is in the northern part of the country, it makes sense to focus on that area, but I’m unsure which cities to prioritize and the best route to take. I’ll be in Italy for 4-5 days and want to make the most of my time before heading to other European countries.

Any advice on cities or routes would be greatly appreciated!

Do sellers do an appraisal when listing homes? ,"Hi! So, we just bought a house and appraisal is this week.  They listed the property ALL over the place and pulled it off the market (obviously lower at some points to create a bidding war). 

They first listed at 2mil, then kept dropping it and we landed at 1.6.  It surely will appraise at MORE than 1.6, right?  Because if someone actually bought it at 2M, wouldn't it not appraise?  The process seems a little confusing to me.

Am I in the wrong?,"I had a family friend who is also a real estate agent helping me find homes for a few years. They were awful. He kept pushing us towards homes that were way over our budget and never had time for homes we liked that were in our budget. We lost out on 2 homes that dropped in price because he didn't watch the prices on them and they were under contract by the time we knew that they were in our budget. He did help with 2 contracts for other homes where the deals ended up falling through, including one where he tried to get us to file illegal paperwork to help the deal go through and we didn't feel comfortable. We ended up buying a house that he never showed us and he was never involved with the process at all. Now he is suing us for the commission on the home we bought. He's also asking for more than double the actual commission. Can he do this to us? I know he did work for us, but he was always lazy and we ended up having to find all the homes we liked ourselves. He was also clearly greedy by only doing work for the homes that were outside our price range. We never complained because he was a friend, but now that he's suing us I'm beyond pissed.

Edit for important info I forgot to add- he sent a demand letter, he isn't actively suing us yet. Also we never signed any contract with him.",18,5,1304,257,0

Help a newbie!,"Hello community! New investor here need advice on a deal I am about to do. Feel free to roast, criticize or give any advice you have I can take it. Backstory: 22 years old about to get out of military after first contract. 70k cash saved up &amp; 775 credit score, no debt. Looking to buy duplex to live in and ultimately renovate if the numbers make sense. I am approved to use VA loan at 5.5% guaranteed. Here are the numbers:
Purchase price: 300k @5.5% (might be able to negotiate new exterior paint job credit)
Monthly costs: mortgage- 1703 tax-245 (2933/yr) insurance- 167
Market rents are 1600$ easy for both sides as is but currently being rented at 1410 and 1325 tenets pay all utilities (separately metered)
Planning on putting aside 20% of rents for Maint, vacancy, capex and will be self managing property. 
Property is fine as is but if fully renovated in my market I estimate 500k-550k ARV. This is a 2500 sq foot 3 bed 2 bath both sides. After renovation rents would be 1900-2000$ so about 4,000$ total rent for both units. If I did the BRRRR method would this work out perfect? 300k purchase + 10-15k closing + 80k remodel + 5k for refinance costs. 80k remodel number I got from my father who is a general contractor in the area. 500k ARV x .80% refi (because it would be my primary residence) = 400k minus 15k closing, 80k remodel, 5k refi cost = 300k my original purchase price. 
Property details: 3 bed 2 bath both sides with attached garages, aluminum siding, copper plumbing, 1972 construction, separately metered, all electric water heater, range, dryer, public water and public sewer on a slab foundation in a great school district right next to brand new construction everywhere. 

My only cash investment would be the 10-15k of closing costs as of right now. I am very very new this is the first house I am ever buying. 
Any advice is welcome. Am I getting a good deal as is? Should I keep it as is or renovate? Do numbers look accurate? thanks!",14,3,1969,344,0

"Sellers hid damage, settle outside of court or sue?","I just bought a house in Oregon, and found that the sellers deliberately hid and didn't disclose major rot (with mycelium growth) on a support beam. There was a large hole cut out of the wall that they had propped up personal property to cover. 

My ""inspection"" was done by a career contractor and was not a formal inspection (and regrettably not very thorough beyond looking in the crawl space and attic, but that's another story), although because of their stuff covering it I don't think a inspector would have noticed either. 

From what I'm reading, it sounds like the case is most likely in my favor - they were clearly aware of it and didn't disclose. If at all possible I'd like to avoid a lawsuit and just settle the issue outside of courts. This is a very small town where everyone knows everyone. 

Is there any reason it would be better to bring it straight to court, for example to protect myself if the damage is greater than it looks? If it is more than I originally settled with outside of court, would I have voided my opportunity to sue in the future? Or could I still sue in the future if necessary?

Edited to add: See my post below clarifying, but I did not have a formal inspection because there were none available in this small isolated town. Also, the point I was asking about was centered around them lying on the disclosures after having lived here for five years - if I could have gotten a formal inspection I would have, no need to keep bringing that to my attention, thank you.

How to predict appraisal on a new construction home in an old neighborhood?,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, so moderators feel free to remove me if not. That said, I’m desperate for some advice on what to expect for an appraisal! We are under contract on a parcel of land in the best neighborhood, but the finances to build will not work well for us if we don’t get a good appraisal. We plan to complete the appraisal in next few months before we start building but after we close on the land, which our builder requires. The details are… 

- House is in an old neighborhood in Eastern VA, most houses averaging 1965 builds. No new builds have sold for comparison. 
- Comparable older homes in the neighborhood go for $220/sqft, often needing some work. 
-There are no really similar neighborhoods with new builds in city or county (neighborhood has water access, lake and marina, and club house with pool), except for one that’s also a gated golf club. A couple luxury new builds in that neighborhood go for $350-550 + /sq ft .
-New construction homes that have recently sold in the city in general go from $190-300 per square foot, and some nearby that are new construction for sale (but not really in a ‘neighborhood’) are $250-300 
- We want to make it work because the location is amazing, walking distance to pool and marina on a corner lot. We plan to build a mostly single-level home with nice outdoor space. The lot is a level 0.6 acres, others are larger (up to 2 acres) but often with slopes, but maybe a water view. 


I guess my questions are: Is there a typical amount that new builds tend to land above older comps? And how much do the things we like about the house/lot factor in? Is there any way to ballpark our appraisal before we start work on the land?

Help me understand mortgage costs and points because I’m feeling misled,"I’m under contract on a home purchase. $825k, 10% down. 

I’ve shopped around 10 lenders and narrowed it down to 2. They were both offering substantially the same terms that interested me, which is a 6.125% rate with a 1/0 buy down   (At no cost) to 5.125% for year 1. And a low-cost one time refinance option. So my plan is to refinance in a year or shortly after, and as such i don’t really want to pay much in points, if at all. 

Lender A told me on 9/20 that to get the 6.125% would cost me $1100 in points

Lender B said the 6.125% would cost me $1,600

I went with a lender A because they were slightly cheaper and the lender whose pre-verification letter is in the offer.

But now as I’m sent the official application to sign and proceed, the loan estimate with Lender A has $3500 in points.

Can things have really changed that much in such a short amount of time?

What to do with about three extra weeks in SE Asia?,"I am going to be solo backpacking around SEA from January to April, starting by looping northern Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. I'll be getting back to Bangkok in mid March and then I'll have about 4 weeks before I fly to New Delhi (from wherever I end up at)

I was initially planning to go down to Phuket briefly to check out Khao Sok for a few days and then use Koh Lanta as my base to check out the Thai islands for about 10 days since Phuket just doesn't sound like my thing. Afterwards I would go to Singapore for a few days and then Malaysia for just under 2 weeks.

However, Western Malaysia is supposed to be super wet in April and I've already been to jungles in central America and will in Vietnam and Thailand as well, so I don't know if it will be worth it. I'm also not sure if there will be enough to do without breaking the bank to spend 10 days on Koh Lanta, so I may have anywhere from 8-16 extra days to do something that is a cheap plane ride from Phuket/Singapore/KL.

I'm currently only going to be spending about 7/8 days in Cambodia between Siem Reap + PP and their surroundings, so I could theoretically add some time here.

However to be able to close by 10/31/24, I need to have renters first months and depot in my account by 10/31/24.

Im worried about how to get a renter to pay first month and depot and how to communicate to them they won't be able to move in untill 11/10/24 (give us a couple days to move). 

What are some creative solutions to this dilemma? ",53,9,655,123,0
"I've been unemployed for a year, should I just say screw it and take a trip to South America? ","I looked into traveling to Costa Rica or Brazil earlier this year in November so I wouldn't have to be in the U.S. for the election. I didn't make any serious plans though because I wanted to be available in case I got any job offers. 

I've lost count of how many jobs I've applied to in the last few months, and while I've gotten a couple interviews, no one has offered me a job. 

My health is good, and I've got plenty savings. I do live with my parents, but they say I can stay as long as I want. 

I can't think of a reason not to go, but is five or six weeks going to be enough time to get ready? What are the main things I should be prepared for in Costa Rica or Brazil? Would it be better to just wait a year?

Appraisals ,"We lost a house. We are considered a backup offer. The current buyer stated that if the appraisal comes back low at his offer(373,) he is not willing to continue the purchase and not fill the gap. Although in our backup offer states we are willing to cover a 15,000 appraisal gap. 

The house was purchased in June at 280, and flipped for 349,999. Me lender and realtor believe the house will not appraise at 373,900

I know they do comps and the state of the house. The house is super updated but similar houses have sold in the past 6 months for 300-325,

I’m thinking the house will come back around 330,000. How do they determine the appraisal other than comps. Do updates really make difference? I sold a house that I flipped and it appraised at asking. But don’t get asking bc she couldn’t afford the gap. This was based on comps. ",11,2,837,153,0

"Newfoundland, Canada - Best Trip Ever","I have been extremely fortunate to travel to many countries in South America, Europe, the Middle East, and more. I am writing today to tell you that the trip I enjoyed the most and had the great pleasure of going on was a trip to Newfoundland, Canada. We spent 3 days in St. John's, the provinincial capital, then rented a car and drove near 4 hours to Bonavista. The countryside was glorious. We stopped at breweries and in a few small towns. Once at our destination, we took day trips to various fishing and artesenal villages. We were out in the sea just meters from the whales. We spent an afternoon watching the Puffins. The people were awesome, probably some of the nicest people in the world, no joke. At one air bnb, a cottage, we befriended the neighbours who invited us to their nightly bonfire with family, friends, and moonshine. The month was August, and the weather was lovely. We had such a fantastic time and hope that you do too :) If I had to move and could go anywhere, I would choose Newfoundland. ",37,6,1018,187,1

Is it possible to plan a family trip when all people involved seem to have conflicting (even opposite) views?,"So, I’m planning a trip with my family (my father, mother, and younger brother), and it is like hitting yourself against a wall constantly. Whenever I have one idea that someone likes, another slams it. I thought it was possible to come to a compromise, but the problem is that both my parents have absolutely different ideas of what a perfect holiday is (one is super active, and likes to see and visit as much as possible, sometimes even too much, and the other is the complete opposite, and likes to relax and just spend time indoors without doing anything), but the problem is that they all want to spend time in family, and no one wants to be left alone. So the thing is that, each one of the people involved want to force their idea unto the rest, and no one wants to compromise, or let the others do what they like.

At this point I really don’t care what we do, but I really don’t know how to organize this so that everyone is at least a tiny bit happy, and we all make at least one good memory.

Anyone been in a similar position? How did you solve it? Is it even solvable?

So far, I tried making a list of NO’s (things that are non negotiable for them. And it looks like this:

- country where it’s cold in December (ideally with temperatures below zero)
- not too crowded. Ideally, based on small cities/towns
- somewhere new. So far we’ve celebrated new years eve in Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Praha, Vienna, Salzburg, London, Helsinki, St Peterburg, Moscow, Riga, Vilnus, Bruxelles, Geneve, Budapest, Stockholm.
- Budget friendly
- somewhere where you don’t have to drive long hours to visit things
- not more than 5 hours away by plane from Spain.

To be honest, I’ve been breaking my brain trying to think of a place that complies with all these conditions that my family imposed on me. I don’t know if such a place even exists, but if anyone has an idea, I would be very grateful.

Delayed luggage with LOT in Warsaw,"I wondered if anyone here had experience with delayed luggage with LOT. 
I had a flight from Bucharest to London via Warsaw last night. The flight from Bucharest left late and I barely made the connection to London.

Today, I have tried to speak to someone about it, assuming it’s a simple matter of getting the bags on the next flight.
Everyone at LOT has been extremely unhelpful, they tell me to contact a different number every time and all they say is that the bags are being traced. 

It’s soon 24h since I got to London, and I have no idea where the bags are. I was coming back from a long trip with lots of clothes and personal items in there. 

What are the chances of my bags appearing once we’re past 24h?

Typical Agent Experience ? ,"Hi all,

I'm based in Adelaide, Australia, and I own a property valued at approximately $1.1 million. Recently, I purchased another property off-market for $1.45 million. The agent who sold us this property, in my opinion, pressured us into using him as the selling agent for our current home.

Initially, he quoted a commission rate of 1.8% with a $5,500 marketing fee for a three-week campaign. I pushed back, saying the rate was too high and unfair, so he reduced it to 1.6%. The issue is that we were supposed to be executing the Form 1 for our new property, but he refused to proceed unless we signed the contract for him to run the campaign on our existing property.

I’m feeling quite anxious about the whole situation and would appreciate some honest feedback. Am I being taken advantage of here? Or should I be grateful that his poor performance for another vendor resulted in a cheaper purchase for us?

I’ve done the calculations, and assuming we get the market value for our property, he’s set to make around $30,000 for three weeks' work, which mostly involves opening the door a few times.

Is this a common real estate experience, or am I getting ripped off? Is it also common to feel super anxious when selling your home? ",27,5,1238,214,0

BOA (Boliviana de Aviación) airlines warning,"Heads-up for anyone traveling to/through Bolivia. 

BOA airlines sucks and is very corrupt (not surprising to anyone who knows Bolivia well). With Bolivia's recent currency volatility, things have gotten a lot worse. Not a lot of options around Bolivia, unfortunately. 

  
**IF FLYING BOA:** 

1. Do not let the airline put priority tags on your luggage (if you are paying for an upgraded seat). All this will do is make your bag a target to be stolen / ransacked when checked 

2. Keep everything valuable with you... Particularly cash (should be obvious but i'll state the obvious)

3. If you are checking a bag, don't lock your luggage. Airline workers will just cut the locks off and ruin your suitcase. Might as well let them search through your things without breaking your suitcase so you don't have to spend a few hundred replacing the luggage they ripped into. BOA will not take any accountability for their employees breaking into your luggage and stealing your belongings.

  
This is not to say Bolivia is not a great country worth visiting. Just note that with the recent currency volatility, things have gotten worse so be extra careful. ",44,6,1153,196,1

NYC in January — recommendations please! ,"My boyfriend and I are planning a trip to New York City in January! I have never been but he has more times than I can count! I fully trust him to plan this trip catered to our mutual likes and interests but I was hoping for suggestions on places to eat, must-see spots, and anything else! 

My only requests for this trip are trying a NYC hotdog and a slice of pizza (LOL), seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, going to the American Museum of Natural History, and finding some good dessert spots/other eateries. He is not a sweets/sugar person so he has left me in charge of that.

Dates: January 10-12, 2025. We are planning to arrive between 9:30am-10:00am on Friday and depart around 2:00pm on Sunday. 

Stay: we have yet to book the hotel but we will be staying right in Times Square 

What he has discussed booking so far: going to MoMA, American Museum of Natural History, two evening shows (a play off Broadway and the blue man group), either Little Italy or China Town, shopping on 5th avenue, and a few restaurants he really wants me to try as they are favorites of his. 

As this is my first time going, we’re trying to hit some really key spots while also not overwhelming either of us since we really only have 2.5 days there.  If anyone can give any recommendations given the time of the year or other tips, I would greatly appreciate it!

* A good customer service that's easy to work with.
* A plan that will actually not have these disconnection/renewal problems every month.

Trying to round out my Taiwan itinerary,"Hi all,

I've got a trip coming up to Taiwan at the end of this month for about 8 days. We'll be starting out in Taipei and planning to do a lot of the common activities and day trips from there (Yangmingshan, Beitou, biking around the city, night markets, Elephant and/or Teapot mountain hikes). 

We want to see another part of the country as well and have landed on Tainan. Currently we're booked for 3 nights there (arrive afternoon day 1, two full days, leave early back to Taipei on day 3). 

I've read that Tainan is all about history and food, and personally I'm not too much into the history when I travel. I'm not disinterested, but I'm not the type of person to prioritize museums or temples just for the educational aspect. I'm more intersted in nature/scenery, food, walking/biking around, local culture. It's very hard to tell if two full days in Tainan is going to be overkill for this and if we should prioritize Taipei time. 

Also we were considering the east coast but spending 5 hours to and from Taitung seemed like a lot of time after the rest of our travel (we'll be in Singapore coming from US first, so a lot of time on planes and traveling). Though biking around that area seems really nice. 

Just trying to find a good way to round out our trip and a bit worried Tainan might be a miss. It seems very polarizing in that many people recommend but then many people say it's boring. For someone like me that wouldn't normally prioritize museums/historical education, is there still enough to fill 2 days that wouldn't be better spent elsewhere?

Buy house linked to organized crime?,There is a house that we like in our preferred future school boundaries.

Apparently a friend or family member still owns and resides in the house. Would you consider this?

No Home Insurance at Closing?,"Hi there - we are relocating from the Midwest to NE Florida for my job. 
We made an offer on a house Sept 14 and it was accepted Sept 15. We’re scheduled to close Oct 21. 
Obviously one of the things we need to close is home insurance, however, we learned today that many insurance companies are in a holding period (not issuing new policies) for 30 days due to Tropical Storm/Hurricane Helene. What happens if we can’t get home insurance by our close date? Anyone been in a similar situation? Or know a company that is not in holding period? ",29,5,543,102,0
Can KLM really trick me into giving them EUR 980,"
All my life I’ve been dreaming of going to Rio de Janeiro. I booked a flight to celebrate finishing my master’s degree. I had to work while studying to afford this trip. I booked a basic fare (EUR 980) by accident and asked customer service if I could upgrade to a student fare (for an extra EUR 110). They told me it was okay. The student fare brings several benefits such as checked-in luggage but most importantly, flexibility. You can reschedule for free and get a refund for EUR 250. So I upgraded. When upgrading I specifically asked if I could get all the benefits from the student ticket. Yes, they said, I specifically asked if I could reschedule for free and if I can reschedule for free and get a refund for the TOTAL price minus the EUR 250 cancellation fee. The lady said yes.

To keep a long story short, my last exam didn’t go as planned and I don’t really know when exactly I can go (this is out of my control). So instead of rebooking the flight for free I decided it’s worth losing the cancellation fee of EUR 250 from my total EUR 1090 and rebook by myself afterwards somewhere in mid-February to mid-March since I didn’t know exactly when I would be able to go.

The issue: I got back EUR 110 and nothing else. I explained to customer support that I was informed the opposite and they simply don’t care. Since I did the upgrade and asked about the cancellation through phone, I expect their guidance and given word to be correct. What can I do?

This post discusses an issue with KLM’s customer service after a flight upgrade and subsequent cancellation.",48,10,1575,286,1

Panama in January: Bocas del Toro vs. Bastimentos Island?,"Hey everyone!

My partner and I with our family are heading to Panama at the beginning of January and trying to decide between staying in **Bocas del Toro** or **Bastimentos Island**.

* **Scuba dive** and **snorkel**
* **Fish**
* Spot some local **wildlife**
* Relax on a **nice sandy beach**

We’re not into the super-commercial vibe, so if anyone has recommendations on where to stay that’s more quiet and off-the-beaten-path, we’d really appreciate it! Also, if anyone has tips on which island is better for the activities I mentioned, that would be super helpful.

Rent or Buy,"I'm selling my current home to move to a bigger one and closer to family. However, I am torn between renting or buying the next one. It's a but of a unique situation.

There is a medium likelihood I'd need to move again 2-3y from now. There is a HIGH likelihood 4-5y. After 5y, likely staying in the home for a total of 15y. This is due to a job situation completely out of my control.

From all the areas I've looked at, rent or buy calculators are telling me 4-6y needed for buying to be cheaper.

Here's the part that makes it even trickier, I own a rental house, but I have a property manager. If I were to buy, it'd be with the intent to rent it after I move. However, I don't think I could justify a property manager in some cases. And I've never managed a property from out of state.

How to best leverage inherited property,"25. I Inherited a SF home from my parents. It’s paid off and is in a decent area. I still live at home, but recently got the property put in my name. 

I’m ready to move out, but do not want to live in the home because it is very close to my current home and I want space, privacy, and a change of scenery. So I  plan to rent the home out, and rent an apartment for myself to start. 

I could rent out the home for more $$ than I’d rent an apartment for myself and would make a slight profit. Worse case I’ll break even. 

My question is, is this a good idea? Bad idea? In the middle?

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts in different subs lately asking if they should carry their passports on them, or leave it in the hotel safe. Most answers say to carry it with you as it’s the only “recognized” valid ID; that a Drivers’ License or a photocopy is not acceptable.

Paying for a parking ticket in Frankfurt (through a bank)

"Selling home, had offers twice , both times contract fell apart during attorney review period. ","We have a home that is two years old. We have kids that we have to transfer schools and a lot of logistics as far as moving goes. 

Twice now we have gotten offers and both times they have canceled the offer during the attorney review period. 

We had two weeks to close this last time, so we had everything packed and ready to go with school transfers and the whole 9.  

It’s extremely frustrating and all the buyers say is that they changed their mind during inspection. And the only thing on the inspection report was a broken pipe. That we have since fixed.

Builder locked in a mortgage rate without written consent. What can I do?,"I am constructing a new home and was offered a rate buy down as an incentive.

I estimate the house is worth at least 50,000, maybe 60,000,  in the current condition.  It isn't a very deep hole as it needs around 10,000 in work to turn into a rental.  I own the house across the street. That 2 bedroom is worth around $125,000 now and rents for $1100.  (paid $28,000 + 25,000 in rehab).   I figure this house will be about the same rent but rehabbed just enough to rent will be worth 100k.   I can't work on it for about 5 months until I finish another house project in progress.  Insurance and taxes are about $1,100 combined for the year.  Comps on the occupied cookie cutter houses on the block are all over 100k.  

It is in a lower end neighborhood but everything that can be rehabbed for blocks around is being bought up by rehab and flip guys.  The area is coming up a bit but I would not say gentrified.

The worst house on the block just sold. It had no metal left in it. boarded up, 40 foot long retaining wall falling in, fire upstairs, lots of issues.  A contractor bought it for the unbelievable price of $60,000 and gutted it.   I was talking with him and mentioned I just closed on the house up the street.  He glanced at it and said ""I will give you 50k right now"".   This is a serious offer.

I am tempted to take the quick money for no work.  Especially so if I can get more than 50.   Of course taxes takes a chunk.

To complicate things, my wife does not know I bought it.  She told me not to buy any more houses because I have just been forced into early retirement.  I lied about the size of the severance settlement and bought the house.  I figure I just converted money into another form of money and I think it is worth more this way anyway.  Right now, most of my income is from rentals.  I don't really care how much they are worth because I am thinking only about monthly income.  So, for example, 45k into that house generates another 1100 in monthly income and it does not matter to me that the 45k is in a less than liquid asset that might be worth twice that.  Assuming I am around, I plan to rent my houses for at least another 10 to 15 years before I sell them all to cash out. 

I also am a flipper of goods bought from estates.  A $15,000 profit would be considered a major win for me in that business but not so much for my real estate side. 

Fix it and rent it or sell now for a quick profit?

Personal mortgage situation (Madrid),"Guys, let's see what you would do in my situation because I feel a little overwhelmed. I am a 27-year-old kid from Madrid, I have a 210k mortgage at 1% interest, 5k in liquid, 30k in investments, and I work in IT with a monthly savings of between €500-700. Plus, I've already spent 10k on improving the house. What bothers me is that in the end I'm going to end up paying about 50k more to the bank in commissions, and the apartment seems expensive for what it is.

Would you amortize part of the mortgage to reduce interest or would you keep the investments and go for the long term? What would you do with that liquid 5k? Invest more, save or cover part of the mortgage? Has anyone else been in a similar situation?",36,4,717,135,0

Broken NFC tag on passport ,"Hello,

I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience. I am a Ukrainian citizen with a residence permit in the EU.

Recently, while traveling, I accidentally spilled water on my biometric passport. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be heavily affected; the appearance and 99% of the stamps look just like before.

However, I’m concerned about the biometric NFC chip embedded in the passport’s cover. I wasn’t even aware of its existence before. Now that I’ve read about it, I found an app called ReadID and tried to scan the chip — but it’s not being detected :(

For instance, my friend’s passport scans without any issues.

My question is: how critical is this problem? Could it affect border crossings, opening bank accounts, or any other procedures where the passport is required? Does this make the passport invalid? Or is there a chance that official institutions have different devices that might be able to read the chip, even if my phone can’t?

Thank you very much in advance for your reply.

(I cannot replace the passport at the moment since I would need to go to Ukraine for that, and right now that would mean being automatically drafted into the war. Although I haven’t lived there for over 10 years.)",27,6,1219,205,1

Dream house numbers are scary ,"Hey Everyone,
This sub has been very helpful throughout my research and accounting throughout the years, but we finally have a conditional offer accepted on our actual dream house, but now I am worried about the finances of it all. This house is centrally located for us near our jobs and families, and is actually down the street where we first lived together. We always loved this house, and when it came on the market, we were incredibly excited. We are in CT in a relatively HCOL area.

I am a teacher with a pension, as well as an HSA that I max out each year, my wife is employed part time as a therapist, and runs her own private practice half of the week, online. Once we factor in our retirement savings, we take home roughly 9k/month.
Our mortgage payment, with taxes and insurance will be just around 3500/month, our monthly expenses will work out to roughly 2950/month (this includes utilities, car payment, groceries, subscriptions, etc) This leaves us with about 2500/month left over for saving and entertainment.
I know that these numbers are close for right now, but my wife is already working to take on a few more clients, and with my contract, I know that I (half of our income) can depend upon a 20% over the next two years, and roughly 10% raises each subsequent year.
Are we making a mistake doing this? I know these numbers aren’t ideal, but we’re of the thought process that this is a house we have always envied, it’s within our grasp, and things should improve on the income end as time progresses.
Any input/advise would be helpful here. Thank you.",30,6,1575,276,0
Maldives - Best local island for snorkeling right off the beach??,"My wife and I are planning to stay on a local island for 6 nights February. We'd like to choose one where the house reef is great for snorkeling right off the beach. The idea is to spend most of our time snorkeling independently without needing to book snorkeling (not interested in diving trips. Looking for easier current, we can both swim but i am less water confident / fit.

The three other factors important to us are:

- At least a few Food options at reasonable prices

- island transfers not more than 1.5 hours from Male by speedboat (but we may take public ferries,)

- A laidback vibe (with a few bits to walk around see but not expecting too much)

We have already booked Dhigurgh for whale shark and those types of trips beforehand. This is for after that 

Our research is pointing us to Fulidhoo, or Dhiffushi, and at a push Thodoo, but i need to look at Ukulhas maybe too

What US airline would you pick to build loyalty?,"Hi all, I started a semi-new job a bit ago and have been traveling semi-frequently, averaging 2 RT per month.  This year I've bounced around on different airlines, but haven't earned any status since I spread out the flights across different companies.  Looking into next year, I'd like to establish a primary airline and suspect I'll be able to earn at least the first level/tier of status. 

With that being said, I'm curious what US airline you would choose to build loyalty with?  I understand that this can vary based on your home airport and where the majority of your travel is to/from so I have the below:

* My home airport is LAX - So Delta, AA, United, and SW would all work.  These are the primary choices for airlines I see for my flights and flew this past year.
* My work travel is 95% in the lower 48 with the occasional trip to Canada.
* My travel destinations vary, so that isn't a primary deciding factor.
* My work travel is in Economy, primarily booked through Concur on a company card, so no CC perks to maximize.
* About 1x/year, I make a vacation trip to Europe.  Ideally this is in Business class for the long haul.  If I have status with an airline/group, it could be helpful.
* I have the regular AmEx Platinum, which gets me some benefits for lounge access at Priority Pass, and at Delta lounges.

Trying to get out of contract signed under false pretenses,"My boyfriend recently signed a contract for a property in a trailer park where he has a rent-to-own mobile home, both from the same rental company out of Utah (we're in Wyoming). His move in date was Oct. 1, and he was not able to see it beforehand, but by the pictures it seemed decent enough, just had a few things that would need fixed.   
However, he found out the day he was supposed to move in that there is s lien on the mobile home due to it being inhabitable. The property owners are now refusing to give him a refund or let him out of the contract, citing that, he's ""Choosing to move out, so the sale isn't canceled."" 

They told him that he could choose to stay and follow the lease, or they can litigate and enforce the lease terms, and that if he chose to abandon the mobile home then ""Thats his prerogative""

They're blaming him for not looking close enough before he bought it, despite having him under the impression that it was a habitable place to live with crazy things like electricity and running water.

I just am trying to figure out if he's actually in the wrong, or if there's still a way to get out of the contract with the money that he went into it with

Buyer Agent did a 180 once I switched from her recommended lender,"
I’ve been working with my realtor while looking at homes and everything was great at first. She recommended a lender but also encouraged me to shop around. I ended up getting prequalified with her lender with a conventional loan, but the rate was higher, so I found a lower rate FHA loan with a broker. Since I chose the broker, my realtor has changed her attitude, giving the broker a hard time with choosing not to communicate with him, and when she does, it is passive aggressive from what the broker has told me.

She argues that I have better chances with a conventional loan with the lender she recommended and blames my FHA for our unsuccessful offers (2 so far). I’m starting to question if she’s actually right, especially since I know FHA loans have stricter rules. However, I feel her behavior isn’t warranted; she should be advocating for me more even with this loan being perceived as inferior to a conventional. I’m unsure if I should let her take the lead with following her recommendations, after all she’s the expert and I’m not, or if this attitude is unacceptable and I should start the process with ending our contract. Every exchange we have makes my blood pressure rise but I want to be sure if she’s right. 

If it matters, I wasn’t really sure how I got the conventional in the first place as my credit is sub 700.

EDIT: thank you all for all your info! I have decided to inquire with my broker on a conventional loan. As for my agent, I just sent the metaphorical break up message. She did acknowledge that it’s been a rocky journey. 

EDIT 2: a lot of people aren’t reading my update on switching to the conventional loan. So here I am again, I GET IT, FHA is inferior to conventional, although not impossible I know it is a huge challenge. I have switched loans already. My agent and I had a long talk about the approach and future expectations, you can read in my comments where she was lacking, it wasn’t just the FHA situation, she WAS getting fired but we talked it out and have put an offer on a home using conventional loan, hope we go under contract soon now that my broker, agent and I can work with each other and not against.

-If we do a multi-family investment, I'm still unsure about how that would work for refinancing and putting that money to work in another property. I'm not seeing any of my calculators for analyzing deals showing that to be a good return with the rents in the area.

LONG STORY SHORT QUESTION:

In this scenario, **would you buy a multi family property and try your hand at renovating/flipping/BRRRR** and live in the same condo we are in now for $500/month, or **would you get a single family home and maybe try doing a flip on that instead?**

Bonus question: should we even consider FHA loans? I have read that the strict inspections and that coupled with the fact that sellers don't want the long timeframes on the loan closing are not favored versus a conventional loan. We couldn't do all cash as anything we are looking at is in the $1.5-1.8 million range for properties.

VAT refund Barcelona Airport Experience ,"I’m traveling with my mother in barcelona. I’m flying home earlier than my mother while she continues her travels. She placed all of her purchases under my passport and I am planning to attempt a VAT refund by myself (I will not be taking all items purchased with me, they’re all smaller items and can also claim they are items I already have if they do ask) She said some airports are more relaxed and did not need to show all items when submitting for the refund. How has your experiences been in the past with the Barcelona airport? Did you really need to show all of the items? I’m just planning on checking the items that I’m bringing with me so will do this prior to security. 

I’ve also read some threads that said there are locations in barcelona that stamp the receipts before the airport so you do not need to check the items there. Can you do this before your day of departure and how does that work? Would you suggest this instead? 

Any information here would be appreciated!! ",40,6,991,183,1

What neighborhood to stay in Barcelona ,"Hi! I am traveling to Barcelona for a week and am trying to figure out what neighborhood to stay in. Here are some of my thoughts:

1) I have been to Barcelona a few times and have seen all the tourist attractions so being close to them is not super important to me. As long as I can get to them somewhat easily on train/ bus, I’m happy!

2) I would like to be somewhere that is less touristy &amp; more locals/spanish people but still has some stuff going on.

3) I am solo traveling as a 26 year old, female so safety is important to me. Being near nightlife is not important, would rather grab a glass of wine at a cute place. 

4)one of my favorite things to is to go to a cute cafe and then shop in boutiques and vintage shops. Staying somewhere that has a lot of this would be great. 

5)a park nearby would be great to sit and read a book but this is not a must-have.

Let me know what you think! Thanks in advance ❤️",39,7,924,180,1
"Wells, ME in October. Looking for day trip and any other suggestions","I’m going from Chicago area to Wells, ME in a few weeks, with my wife and kids (middle and high school). We’re driving there, with an overnight stop at about twelve hours (eastern NY or PA, depending which highway we take).

Does this triplex make sense for us? ,"Looking to buy a triplex in the 460k range with 5% down. PITI is 3600ish. 

Exceptional neighborhood, very desireable. Two units are dated, rent for $1200. Third unit is semi-updated - lease up end of November, I would likely live in this unit with my wife as our first owned home. If it were to rent on the market, I'd say it could fetch $1500. 

Does this math work out for a way to build some equity while keeping our costs low? I'm aware that maintenance, potential vacancy, etc will be a factor. However we're currently paying $1500 for rent without building any equity. 

Any guidance is highly appreciated 🙏

Vulture letters,"One of my brothers passed in April, and I am the executor of the estate.  The estate had to go through probate, which makes the will public record along with my name/address since I was named executor.  As part of his estate planning, he did what's called a TODD - a Transfer on Death Deed.  This is in Minnesota, US.

What the TODD does is transfer the deed to a designated person and the house is not part of the estate.  The TODD named another brother as the beneficiary (not sure that's the correct term) of the TODD.  So, 30 days after death, the lawyer files paperwork with the county and the house deed is now in my living brother's name as if he owned it all along.  The owner's name is also changed on the county records.

However, since probate was filed (in May) until now I have continued to receive letters and phone calls regarding selling the house.  I got a call the day after probate was filed.  Really?  My brother is barely dead and the vultures come out.  Many of the letters are 'official' looking, using ""probate"" in the return address.  

I have refused most of them and sent emails back to others.  It would take about 3 minutes of research to find out that the house is not in probate and the new owner is listed on the tax records for the county.

The house is on one end of a major metropolitan area and many of the letters are from realtors on the opposite side of the area and a different county.  

So, realtors - please do some research before sending out these letters.  Every time I get one, it makes me angry and sad.  ",15,2,1553,303,0
Home assessed value is up but taxes remain about the same,"I'm a homeowner, and school district taxes are out.
Apparently my home's assessed value is up by over 8% from last year, yet due to a different calculation of taxes (lower tax per assessed $ value), it's just about the same actual dollar value as it was last year.

The new value they assessed my house at, is 99% correlated with Zillow - not sure if they go off Zillow or similar, or if it's just correlated.

Considering I had to fix a lot of things in the house, and I'm still working on it, the real market value is not even close to the assessment - I can barely sell it for what I bought it at, _after_ having done some pretty extensive renovations. I bought the house at a stressful period, and I was eager to just snatch something, be it as it is.
I bought the house in March 2024.

I suppose some would wonder why I would contest it, if the $ value of the taxes remains the same, and well, if I can successfully contest it, I can lower my tax, so tax _remaining static_ is not a valid argument - if the tax unit per $ assessed is down, it's an opportunity to pay less tax (if I can successfully contest).
Additionally, I don't know if county and city tax will act in the same way as school tax.
And if there's one thing that's almost certain, it's that taxes don't really go down.

There is however an additional consideration - would contesting the assessment affect anything else?
Can it have an effect on the house's is resell value?
In other words - does a high assessor's assessed value ever have a positive impact?",57,11,1529,280,0

Anniversary trip - northern lights or safari or ???,"10 year anniversary is coming up and can't decide on a destination. We're leaving our 3yo at home with the grandparents and this might be one of our last kid-free trips. I'm torn between wanting to make the most of it and actually relaxing. Biggest constraint is that we have 8 days max (sat-sat).

Option 1: 3 night aurora chase from Tromso, norway + 3 nights havila cruise or observatory in senja. Pro: trip style is familiar to us, jet lag works in our favor, current solar cycle may be peaking. Con: disappointment at not seeing northern lights and the cold. 

Option 2: South Africa safari, targeting a malaria free game reserve. Considering using a travel agent because uncomfortable booking everything myself. Pro: animals!!! Con: jet lag and game drives are early morning, I am a mosquito magnet. I feel like an utterly irresponsible parent for considering the safari although I know I could get sick/die anywhere.

Also considered Galapagos islands, Hawaii big island, amalfi coast, and doing a cancun all inclusive.

Feedback please. Would you choose the northern lights trip knowing that you might not see anything? I think the safari is doable with a teenager but I don't think I would take my kid on a northern lights trip.",51,9,1236,208,1

Confusion turned ugly ,"Long story short, accidentally signed 2 exclusive agent contracts. We’ll call them Agent A &amp;B. A being our original, B Being the most recent one. I did not know you couldn’t have more than 1 agent when buying. We have been signed to Agent A for months now. Signed to agent B for only a couple days. 

We’ve had agent A for a while now. Together we’ve looked a handful of different homes. Found one we really like as of recently.

Agent B was helpful by all means but only showed us homes that they knowingly knew were completely out of our budget. While doing so, we thought we were signing a “viewing” agreement but it was a agent agreement. They never asked if we had anyone else helping us. Well we recently told them we were sticking with our original agent. They spoke very rude to us and basically told us we couldn’t do anything without them because of the paper work. Now shes threatening to take our original agent to the Board Of Commission. 

Yes I know we should have read the fine print . Yes I’m a first time homebuyer , I take full blame for all of this. We were never trying to undermine or take advantage of either agent. The process moves so fast and we have been traveling out of town a lot as of lately. Are we legally bound to Agent  B ? Or does our original contract with Agent A outweigh the newer contract with agent B.

Inherited house flooded,"Please help!

My mom passed away earlier this year. She had a reverse mortgage on her home. I inherited it, and planned on making a small profit after selling it. Nothing huge, just enough to pay down some bills and maybe create a little savings for me. I’d estimate between $50-110k, but I guess it depends on the market.

I cleared the house and was having some small things done by a handyman, mostly painting. At the last minute, I had him change a couple of bathroom taps to make them more modern. Everything was going great, and I was even excited and proud of it because it looked great. 

There was a huge flood overnight. I’m out of the area, so I have no idea what happened. The neighbor called to say there was water coming out of the garage. I was devastated, but the water got turned off and the handyman insisted he could remove the carpet and get some fans going. He did remove the carpet. 

I called the insurance and explained what happened. They went out today and said everything needs to be ripped out. All the walls have to be taken back to the studs. The insurance company gave me all kinds of confusing information like what would be covered and what it depended on. I have never owned a home and I don’t really own this one since there is not a huge amount of equity in it. 

* will the insurance restore it back to what it was?
* should I strip everything down to the studs and just sell it as is?
* should I just walk away and let it go?

Sell vs Rent? ,"Reading over other post here regarding this question, I see each person's situation is unique and I need to ask from my own person perspective. 

I own (no mortgage) a 2 bedroom 3 bath house in a pretty remote part of Arkansas, more of small retirement area, not much work there. 

I bought another condo a while back and put this house on the market (Feb 2024) and have only gotten low ball offers and even the one I accepted backed out. I am so tired of dealing with this and am thinking of leasing it.

My concern is of course the headache of leasing when I live 4 hours away. I guess I can hire a lease management company? Since I don't owe anything on it, I haven't got a mortgage to consider, the going rate in the area for a place my size is at least 1000.00 a month. HOA fees are going up to 216.00 a month, which I absolutely get NOTHING for. When I bought this place it was 106.00 a month.

My realtor put an offer on the apartment with a cash for keys clause that offered the tenant 2 months rent to vacate the property at least 24 hr before the 60 day closing period. The renter refused and said she could consider in 3 months but doesn’t have an answer right now. Any guidance on how to handle this situation? Ideally the renter would move in 60 days but it doesn’t sound like that’s happening. Also, what should I be considering if I proceed with the purchase while the renter is still there (e.g, different mortgage terms and fees?) thanks in advance for advice! 

Note - the tenant has been in the apartment for 1.5 years and has kept it in pristine condition.  ",42,8,845,158,0

Management change during lease. Moving &amp; trying to avoid paying 2 leases,"I signed a lease for a duplex in Cleveland, Ohio on 09/15/2022. The year lease went through 09/14/2023 and I renewed until 09/14/2024. I do pay on the first of the month, and the first month I moved here was prorated rent. During my second year here, I was notified of a management change. In August of this year, I contacted the new management company asking about seeing a new lease. I spoke with someone on the phone stating I would be doing month-to-month until they send a new lease over, which I can then review (rent increase &amp; other changes) and see what I’d want to do.

I found somewhere else to live that would start on 10/15, and gave my current unit my 30-days notice today (10/08). They stated although the last lease I signed is technically over, it is still in effect until I sign a new one with them with whatever contract they create. They stated that they don’t do prorated rent and I’d have to most likely pay for all of November since it wasn’t a proper 30-day notice.

My old lease does state: Notwithstanding this Paragraph 1, Tenant may, upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the Landlord, terminate the Lease provided that the Tenant pays an early termination charge equal to three (3) months' rent (the ""Early Termination Fee""). Any early termination will be effective as of the last day of the calendar month following the end of the thirty (30) day notice period (the ""Early Termination Date""). The Early Termination Fee will be in addition to all rent due up to and including the Early Termination Date.

I am just looking for a way to not have to pay for the full month of November. I feel like I can at least fight for paying a prorated amount (since I did in the last lease I signed &amp; that’s what they’re holding me to), or only until mid-November, since my lease states it starts and ends middle of the month. 

If anyone has any information that’d be great!

My LTV qualifies based on appraisal even with the HELOC but it seems the HELOC would prevent me from removing PMI now? My previous service provider didn’t have this requirement and it’s not listed in the Freddie or Fannie requirements for removing PMI.

Leaving our house furnished,"I just wanted to make sure I’m not missing some worst case scenario that’s worse than what I’m imagining.

Everything that would be left behind is nice enough to use (even if it’s just temporarily) or sell for some $ on FaceBook marketplace. There is nothing that is truly junk and would warrant haul off. Nor is there a lot of stuff that would take several hours to clear out.

Now I do understand that is an opinion and it is possible a buyer would disagree. Is there a worse outcome that I’m not picturing than said buyer taking us to small claims to pay a junk haul off bill?

Suspicious listing agent?,"There’s a home I’ve been checking out for the last week, trying to get the loan in order and set before going in to make an offer. 

My realtor (who I trust) ended up telling the listing agent how much I love the home, and how I’ve been attracted to it for a few years, so I’m pretty set on making the purchase. I thought maybe this could help my case, considering it was an older home in a very rural area and it wasn’t getting any attraction at all. Not the case. My realtor called the listing agent to schedule a showing in the evening, and the listing agent just happened to schedule a showing that overlapped our showing.
The whole time the listing agent was being SO rude to us. She barely even had information on the house itself, and wouldn’t answer any of our questions.
She proceeded to bring the other group closer to us, where they very loudly talked about “how serious they were and an offer will be put in tonight!”

No offered was put in that night. The very next night, about 7pm I get a call telling me that an offer has been put in and I have less than 20 hours to put my offer in before it closes.

Now I know the market goes fast, but is there potential of the listing agent lying about the offer? My realtor wasn’t digging on her one bit, and neither were we. She 100% thinks she just wants to light a fire under our asses to get the “biggest and best offer” on the table.

We had two bullshit showings, nobody showed up to the open house this past weekend and I have a feeling we’ll get no offers tomorrow.

We have been paying the mortgage in cash every month and have never missed a payment. There is a living grandfather, the home was owned sole and separate from him. There was a will leaving the home my wife’s mother, the only child of said grandparents, who had deceased prior to grandmother dying. Wife is also an only child. There is also an estranged sister of the grandmother somewhere in Pennsylvania somewhere? No party wants anything to do with the house and believe that the house belongs to my wife.

 

When my wife’s grandmother passed, it was her understanding that the home would need to go through probate, and the process would be expensive. She didn’t have the money or the connection to the house to want to keep it; she wanted to use it and walk away from it when she was done, a decision that I have never agreed with. We got married earlier this year and have lived in this house almost the whole time that we have been together with the permission of the executor, a family friend. (I include this tidbit bc of the possibility that someone bring up adverse possession)

 

The home has become somewhat dilapidated over time. Needs a new roof, the HVAC just went out, the flooring is falling apart and is becoming less and less livable. We do not want to invest in fixing this home up if we will not be getting a return on that investment. As we get closer to purchasing a home of our own, the equity that we have been building over time in the home, dilapidated or not, looks more and more appealing to him. We are just against the clock and are not liquid for that much cash (our biggest barrier atm).

 

We want to purchase a home now and we are feeling the pressure of this home falling apart around us. We cannot carry two mortgages if we must go through the probate process, which we understand takes an average of 18 months. I wanted to see if anyone out there with a better understanding of Prop 19 and the changes since 2017 might be able to shed some light on our situation.

 

TLDR: Is there a way to avoid probate of dead grandma’s house?",34,5,2462,460,0

Croatia: Transportation options from Pula (or that general area) to Dubrovnik?,"Hi all! I’m going to Croatia in a few weeks and was hoping to get some additional input here. We’re going to be staying mostly around Pula but I am DYING to see Dubrovnik and have booked my return flight out of that airport. I’m trying to figure out the best way to get there. 


Flying: Always an option but the times are somewhat limited, which isn’t ideal


Driving: Not a great option as I get very tired when driving long distances 


Bus: It seems like any bus from Istria would take multiple changes, which I prefer to avoid. It also looks like there may (?) be a direct bus during the day, which means losing a whole day of doing stuff. Are there any direct overnight buses I may be missing?


Train: From what I can tell it’s not really an option but please correct me if I’m wrong! It looks like the train mostly runs down the center of the country and doesn’t actually have a stop in Dubrovnik but it’s totally possible I’m missing something 



I’m guessing flying will end up being my best option but I’m hoping someone who’s actually been there may have some little gem to share that I have completely overlooked",78,11,1126,206,1

Which airline app to check in on?,"Hi all, would especially love input from any United or Air Canada ticketing agents or folks who flies Air Canada and United with similar segments regularly.

My partner booked a reward round-trip flight via Amex Travel to Edinburgh on a combo of United and Air Canada aircraft. Every flight outbound and home bound on the Amex Travel site shows only the United confirmation number and flight numbers. I was able to get the Air Canada confirmation number by looking up his reservation on United.com

Flights to Edinburgh:
IND - EWR (Operated United Express)
EWR-EDI (Operated by United)

Flights home:
EDI - YYZ (Operated by Air Canada)
YYZ -IND (Operated by Air Canada Jazz)

We know he can check in online and get boarding passes in the United app for the outbound part, but was unsure if he would need to check in on the Air Canada app instead for the flights home since they are both operated by Air Canada.

Is anyone able to provide clarity?

Legality of bypassing buyers agent commision agreement. ,"We are close to closing on a home. My husband signed a buyers agreement saying he is on the hook for 3% fee for our buyers agent. However the seller wont budge from 1%. Our agent insists we pay the 2% out of pocket.

Switzerland &amp; Austria - Car or Train?,"I am planning a trip for me and my husband in late Spring 2025. Nothing is set in stone yet, but we are looking at Switzerland and Austria as I have family in that region.

Would it be recommended to use the train and public transit or a car? It doesn't look like trains save much time, and sometimes it is faster to drive, depending on the destination. We can rent a car in Geneva and return it in Vienna, which would be convenient. I just don't know which would be better price-wise. We obviously can't predict the price of fuel in 8-9 months, but I also know that even with the Swiss Half Pass, the cost of trains and other public transport will start to add up, especially as we want to do some of the more remote hikes like Oeschinen Lake.

  
We went to Scotland in 2023 and we did not have a rental car, and it really hindered us because there was a massive tube strike going on. We were supposed to have a car, but got denied because we were under 25 at the time.

  
I'm just wondering if for convenience, it would be better to rent a car. But I also want to go about this the most cost-effective way without feeling like it's a burden (either way). Any advice is much appreciated!!",41,7,1191,229,1
"Ethics question, advice","We're in the early stages of preparing to put our primary residence on the market. VHCOL area and our home is in the 90th percentile of price for the town. Not quite the tippy top but very close.

As part of the process we're doing our due diligence and meeting with the leading agents in the area.

During one of the meetings, an agent claimed to have a current buyer in-hand who they were due to show comparable homes to literally two days after our meeting. They showed us screen shots indicating proof of funds for said buyer (including the person's name, which felt icky to me and possibly unethical if not illegal though not the point of my post; I later googled and found the person to be a plausible buyer of such homes). Agent also said he had a signed agreement with this person to represent him as a buyer's broker for 2.5%.

I said great feel free to bring them by, we'd tidy up, etc. He then said I'd need to sign an exclusive, non-MLS pocket listing in order for him to show the house. I told him he could show it FSBO. He said no, he needed a signed seller's agreement because he had a fiduciary responsibility to his buyer to get him the lowest price possible, part of which included trying to get me, as seller, to pay the fee.

I told him he could do that as part of any offer and subsequent negotiation. I also reminded him that once I signed a seller's agreement he'd then have a fiduciary responsibility to *me.* I told him that I maintained that he could show it FSBO and that regardless I was not prepared to sign anything with anyone at this moment. And...that was the last I heard from him.

Thoughts? Was he just grubbing for the listing? If he did have a live buyer, shouldn't he have shown our home or at least presented it as an option?",23,3,1765,326,0

I budgeted about 6K total for the trip, is what I have leftover enough to have good food/cool experiences with?

So far as getting around is concerned, we won’t have a car. I’m hoping to rely on both ride share and the trains for travel around the coast (North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady, Musselburgh, Dunbar, etc). Any suggestions on what is most cost effective?

"Conventional Mortgage Lender requires to certify ""Property has no defects"" and ask to permit them to inspect post-closing and request repairs","We have a house in the late stage of purchase contract.

report and assist in a post-correction inspection of the property repairs.""

Have you ever seen Lender requiring Buyer to sign that at closing? 

Buyer would not sign as Home Inspection Report states a list of defects, so the Buyer won't be able to certify ""no known defects"".

Lender refuses to accept Home Inspection Report as one of documents for underwriting, to determine themselves whether Property is eligible for Conventional Loan. Looks like they are afraid they won't be able to sell the loan to Fannie / Freddie, and try to drop this responsibility to the Buyer. Lender also refuses to issue a Loan Denial Letter, stating that it is just Buyer that refused to sign a document required for a fully approved Conventional Loan.

If Buyer refused to sign, did Lender issue Loan Denial Letter or simply stated that Buyer refused to close?

The purchase contract is in loan contingency period, but the Loan Denial Letter is required from Lender to terminate it based on this contingency.

I use Zillow but can't see exactly what to do to get those kinds of alerts. 

Does anyone have a recommendation for the best app to use for this specific task?",28,6,479,88,0
Help!! Co-owner on deed won’t sign over rights to sell,"Long story short: my elderly mom owes 50k in prop taxes on her house (inherited from her dad) in bad shape, or they foreclose Oct 17.

Disputed charge vs Orbitz?,"Has anyone ever disputed a charge vs Orbitz and won? Any details you can provide?

Quick-and-dirty: I'm alleging a system glitch that resulted in wrong class of service and wrong ticket and wrong fare. I \*paid\* what they said I bought (fine, I'm OK with that part), but only once before in my 15-years history have I bought a fully-restricted fare - that was in October 2023, lol. For context, I take more than 40 flights per year almost all through Orbitz, so we're talking 500+ flights via Orbitz in my history. That's quite a sufficient sample size to conclude ""Oh, he always books changeable tickets"".

I had an outstanding flight credit with Air Canada. Because I was going to fly Air Canada (AC) for the new trip, the Orbitz system signaled - ""hey, you have an outstanding credit to use for this flight"" - but when I attempted to book the Premium Economy ticket, it failed for whatever reason, multiple times. I finally just made a new payment with credit card, because I needed to travel.

Fast-forward, I now I have a basic economy ticket. OK, no Premium seat AND doesn't allow changes. Whatever, I'm not bougie, I just need to fly back to Copenhagen.

I take the trip. I don't get to bring the extra checked bag (I'm Star Alliance Gold) and the Economy seat is not comfortable, but the Maple Leaf Lounge in Montreal is nice. They get credit for that.

HOWEVER, I need to change by return dates and initially, Orbitz said ""you have to contact AC for changes"" and then when I did so, AC said ""you have to contact Orbitz for changes"", and then Orbitz - of course - sent me to AC. I finally got AC on the phone and they said ""no change"".

I was online with Orbitz more than 2-1/2 hours tonite and they're refusing to accept responsibility for this error. For context, we've been dealing with an impending death in the family. There is ZERO chance I'm booking any flights that could not be changed. Even if there was no space in Premium or I was priced out of Business, I'm still getting an Economy ticket that allows for changes. And in addition to that, the other Cause of Action is the fact that I sought the booking on Air Canada in large part because Orbitz's website SIGNALED me that I had a $1700 flight credit to use for the trip. For the use of the credit to then be disallowed at point-of-purchase is a CLEAR indication of a system glitch, to say nothing of the fact that I'm a pretty experienced traveler who generally knows what I'm booking.

Lastly, to be clear, Air Canada is not to blame here. They are proceeding based on standing policy and what they were told by Orbitz. They are not willing to make an exception, and essentially accept responsibility for what Orbitz did wrong. The extra bag issue aside, I'm cool with that. I have no problem segregating the issues. Orbitz doesn't even need to admit any error. But they do need to fix it.

How late in the day is too late to view a property? ,"I’ve been condo/house searching for years and I found one that I love that just went on the market today after a few days “coming soon.” Properties like this go very fast, and I’d love to look at it today, but I have a lot of commitments including work.

Money comments on having just returned from a trip to the UK.,"My wife and I recently spent three weeks in the UK, mostly touring by train and car. Wonderful trip but I noticed two things I didn't expect.

The UK was expensive! I would rank it right up there with Switzerland. We stayed in three star hotels and B&amp;B's, rated 8.0 or higher on Booking. We paid US$350 per night in London and Edinburgh, US$250 or less in the countryside, breakfast included. Restaurant prices were high too, we paid pound for dollar. Meaning that a pasta dish would cost GBP20, which is US$26. A burger might be GBP16 = US$21. Gasoline cost around US$8.50 per US gallon. Entrance fees for attractions were high, up significantly from the Rick Steve's prices we saw in a four year old book. Like US$40 to see Stonehenge. Museums in London were still free.

British restaurants have caught the tipping disease. They use hand held. point of sale devices for card payments (normal) and the bill almost always included an ""optional service charge"" of 10%. The server would point out that it's optional but there it was, already added into the bill. Incidentally, quite a few restaurants, pubs and deli's are cashless. It was payment by card only. If you go make sure you have a chip card. (Pay toilets in the parks cost 20 pence to use and no longer accept coins. You have to tap your credit card -- chip -- and you're in. It shows up as a 27 cent charge on your CC bill.)

Transportation: The train was expensive too, although we didn't try to book ahead to save money and did walk-up ticket purchases. London to York cost US$94 per person, second class. Car rental was a pleasant surprise. We reserved with Enterprise from the US five months before the trip and were pleased with both the price and the service. And you don't need an Oyster card for the London underground anymore. You can use a chip card in the same way and you get the same fare as with an Oyster card. You just tap in and tap out. No muss, no fuss.",61,12,1937,351,1
37M Solo Traveller from the UK Seeking Advice for US Trip,"Hey everyone, I've solo travelled a lot around Europe and Asia, but now I'm planning my first solo trip to the US and would love some advice as I'm utterly clueless about the country! I'll be traveling for 17 days in January 2025 and hitting three main spots: New York, New Orleans, and Puerto Rico. Budget is quite relaxed but obviously don't want to go crazy, what I priced up in this post came to about $2500 for flights and accommodation.

* New York: A no brainer really, there's everything to do here, plus it’s where most of the cheapest UK flights land. I’ll spend 5 nights here.
* New Orleans: Always been on my list, I'm not totally sure why, possibly the mix of good food, music, and unique colonial architecture / culture. It's somewhere I've always wanted to go, maybe just for that Gumbo. Another 5 nights.
* Puerto Rico: For winter sun and the Spanish-American cultural blend, the rest of the trip will be quite active, so this feels like a nice way to relax before heading home; 5 nights here to finish.

Here’s where I could use some help: I’d like to visit a smaller, less touristy (for Brits anyway) city for 2 nights between New York and New Orleans. Initially, I thought of something down the East Coast, but then I came across Portland, Maine. As a bearded man in his thirties, the cliché rings true and I'm big into craft beer, and as a big NEIPA drinker, going to New England really appeals to me. I hear Portland has 27 breweries in the city, and will also have that smaller city vibe, so I think I'd really enjoy it there. However, it’s a bit tricky to reach and expensive for just two nights. So the question, Is it worth it, or would you suggest elsewhere?

About me: I’m an extroverted introverted, so really enjoy meeting locals and fellow travellers alike when my social battery allows it, so I’ll look for social accommodations and group activities like walking tours or pub crawls when in the bigger cities, are these a thing in NYC/NO? I live for good coffee, good food and good beer, and seek them out everywhere I go, I'm expecting to be very happy in America in this regard. I'm also a metalhead, and have always been curious about the American metalcore scene, would love to find some bars along the way that align with that, maybe thats more likely in NYC? Oh, and I’d love to see an NHL game whilst here! I see Rangers vs. Blue Jackets is on when I'm planning to be in town, anyone know how hard it is to get a ticket for this?

Thanks for reading this far, none of this is set in stone, so any recommendations, critiques, or advice would be hugely appreciated! Oh, and finally, how welcoming is the US for British solo travellers, and am I going to have fun?",57,11,2699,492,1

Buying a house in a different state a year before I move,"I am currently renting in my current state. I recently re-signed my lease, which ends next year in August.

I've been looking at homes online **in a different state** (where I grew up) for a few months now and came across something I like at the right price. I've been in contact with the seller's agent and it seems we might be able to get an offer accepted.

I was excited until I came across the difference between **primary resident mortgage vs investment mortgage.** 

If I bought a house now, my plan was to find a renter for 1 year and then move in afterwards. From what I've gathered about primary residence mortgages, is this illegal and considered mortgage fraud? I find it hard to believe that homebuyers are kind of forced to only look for homes with 1-4 months left on their leases unless they want to throw away a ton of money from either their lease or empty home.

So, are these the only options?

- Wait until May-July 2025 to look for a house.

- Buy now. Move in. Lose money on my lease (my lease has no early termination clause. I could try negotiating with my landlord, of course.)

- Get an investment mortgage and go with the original plan (Judging by rates, probably a no-go)

edit: Appreciate the replies and it seems I have an answer. I'll add an additional note that my job is indeed remote and I've gotten approved for a move without issue.",56,12,1368,244,0

First Street Flood Factor inaccuracies,"Hi all, does anyone have any success stories regarding getting a map changed with First Street's Flood Factor data?  They have drawn a river through my home and have the culvert where the water actually flows under the street as high and dry.

Superiority complex on steroids...  How can a company release a product that has the potential to cause significant financial harm to someone **and** have an actual policy that says they are smarter than you, don't bother trying?!

[realtor.com](http://realtor.com) actually agreed with me and at least removed the flood score, but the map looks devastating and is out of their control (though I think they have a little responsibility here to keep their vendor honest).  Kudos to them regardless for having a Customer Care department though.  They were pleasant to interact with.

Frustrated in the time I've put into this...  Frustrated that I don't know how to resolve it...  In one part of their site they seem to entertain the vague possibility of *maybe* listening if the person shows up with a FEMA LOMA letter.  As best I can tell, that involves me having to go hire a survey crew.  I'll be mad if I have to do that, but in other parts of their site they are adamant that their data is better than FEMA and say that FEMA data is irrelevant, so I'm not sure what a LOMA letter would actually change.  I'd be way more mad if I went through the hassle, time and expense of that only to find that it didn't move the needle with First Street.

I booked accommodation at a 5 star hotel down there and I've received a message to say that I must provide advance payment a day before travel otherwise I'll have my reservation cancelled. 

They've sent bank details for me to transfer to and although they are a known and established hotel (Roseate House in Delhi Aerocity) , this makes me a bit nervous. 

I know that if anything goes tits up in any manner, I'm going to struggle to get the bank to help me / have no protection because I made a bank transfer and didn't use a debit card/credit card to make the payment. 

  
Can someone tell me if this sort of thing is common in India or?....",85,15,919,173,1

"Last months of our trip, Nepal or more SEA ?","Hey travelers,

my girlfriend and I are in the last month of our one year world trip and have a hard decision to make.

So far we travelled Argentina/Bolivia/Peru/Chile/Columbia/Mexiko/Japan/South Korea and now are in Laos. Our original plan was to go to north Vietnam (Ha Giang Loop) after Laos and then fly to India for a month and afterwards to the Philippines in December cause we gonna met some friends there.

We did some hiking in the andes in South America and fell in love with it. So another option would be to fly to Nepal instead of Vietnam and do the three passes trek and just 2 Weeks India. ( I have been to India before )

So its basically 

Vietnam/India/Philippines/New Zealand 

vs 

Nepal/India/Philippines/Vietnam or New Zealand

I know this is really about personal preferences but still we would be happy for some input from other travelers. Both North Vietnam and Nepal were affected by the current floods so we are quite unsure about that also. Is is even possible to do the three passes trek that spontaneous ? Also we are travelling with hand luggage and would have to buy/rent a lot of stuff in Nepal.

Thanks !

Daniel

25 year old with a $170k Income,"I want to start off by saying I am not writing this post to boast about my income. I am simply wanting to gain insight into how people are diversifying wealth at a young age. 

I am 25 years old and work a commissioned job in Tech. I am set to bring in approximately $170,000 this year. All of my debts are paid off and I do not have any student loans. I live in a state where there is no state income tax.

My company does not offer a 401k and so I currently invest in mutual funds and have already contributed the maximum to my Roth IRA. My company pays me weekly and I automatically deduct $325 per week or $1,300 per month towards my investments. 

I currently rent a one bedroom apartment (nothing fancy) and pay $1,500 per month.
The housing market in my city is insane. Housing prices have almost doubled in the last 4 years and continue to get more expensive. The average price for a house in the city (that I want to live in) is around $500k- $650k. 

All of the influencer “gurus” say that the fastest way to growing your wealth is real estate. Disclaimer… I do not buy into the vast majority of the garbage that these “gurus” put out there. However, there is a common trend amongst the wealthy. Real estate= financial freedom. 

What are different ways I can diversify my investments? Should I buy a house next year since the fed just cut interest rates down to 4.8%? Any advice would be much appreciated!",31,7,1416,263,0

New York and New Jersey,"Hey all,

My husband is turning 30 and he has always wanted to go to both New York and New Jersey (we are based in the UK). For simplicity and to just be near everything, I was going to book the trip with British Airways that includes flights and a hotel around Midtown for 5 nights.

* Is Midtown the best to stay for convenience?
* I've got a long list of things to see and do for NY, what about NJ? And can we get there on public transport of should we hire a car?
* I was going to book for February/March time. We're quite comfortable with it being on the cold side and would rather it be chilly with less crowds. I was wondering whether as it is out of season will stuff be closed? Or will we be okay?

Cash vs Mortgage: New Primary Residence,"Hi! I’m evaluating a potential purchase and would appreciate insights from those experienced in this area.

Current situation:
I own a property and am considering buying a new primary residence (over $2M) with cash from a family inheritance. I’ll sell my current home in 3-6 months and intend to stay in the new home for about 15 years. The home has been on the market for 2 weeks with no offers that I am aware of. In my area, houses are usually on the market for 3-4 weeks and trends are that 80% sold over asking last month.

I’m deciding between buying outright in cash or getting a mortgage. I’d like to understand the economic implications of each option. 

1. Leverage in a sellers market: Do you believe there’s room for negotiation on the asking price given the competitive market and if so, what percentage below asking should I consider? 

2. Mortgage considerations: Would it be wiser to get a mortgage with a larger down payment instead? What factor should influence the decision given my adequate cash flow and financial stability?

3. Tax implications: As someone in the highest tax bracket, what are the tax implications of buying in cash versus using a mortgage? 

Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!",39,6,1273,215,0

"WSJ: In a Florida Town Ravaged by Storms, Homeowners All Want to Sell","https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/st-petersburg-florida-homeowners-hurricane-insurance-cost-4bc92822

Non paywalled: https://archive.is/fawWw

&gt; ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.—Kellen Driscoll bought his home here in 2019, settling in the coastal enclave of Shore Acres. It flooded for the first time four years ago after tropical storm Eta dumped more than 3 feet of water.

&gt; Hoping it was a fluke, Driscoll tore out the affected drywall and started fresh. After all, the four-bedroom home built in 1960 had no flood history. 

&gt; But then it happened again, and again. Like many others in the community, he put his home up for sale in the spring of this year. After seeing little interest, he cut the asking price. 

&gt; On Friday, Hurricane Helene deposited more than 6 feet of storm surge in the neighborhood. The rushing waters ripped the “For Sale” sign off his front lawn, and etched a waterline that reached halfway up his front door, just underneath the doorbell. He reduced the asking price for a fifth time.

&gt; “We flooded here four times in the last four years,” said Driscoll, as he threw his television sets, furniture, appliances and other belongings to the curb. “I’m just hoping I can sell the house. It’s a good neighborhood for sure, but dealing with the floods is horrible.”",69,13,1294,202,0

Should I buy a home?,"I know this is reddit, so I'm not going to take advice without any thought, but I'd like to hear thoughts on my situation and whether buying a house is a good idea.  
I'm 28 and me and my SO are looking at buying a house soon.

The home we're looking at is $630,000 and the rate we're looking at is 5.25% with about $20,000 worth of points. The home is available in January and would involve breaking our lease for around $9,000 (it's high because we received concessions). The HOA is $320/month.

Our financial situation is as follows:

Me: $130k in cash, 108k in stocks, 30k in Roth IRA, 165k in 401k

Salary: $128k/yr

SO: $50k in cash, 25k in stocks, 25k in Roth IRA, 35k in 401k

Salary: $90k/yr

The cash to close would be about $158k (not including $9000 for lease break). So it would be about 167k.

Any advice on how to go about paying this (for example, taking out of Roth IRA vs cash or something like that) is appreciated.

Any thoughts on buying a home being a bad idea in my situation is also appreciated!

We currently have no kids, but plan on it soon and just feel it is better to buy a home sooner rather than later. We like the area of the home and can see ourselves their for 10+ years. It is one of the last end unit townhomes in the development for a reasonable price for the area so that's why we're looking at breaking our lease to get it. If we don't get this one, we will likely have to look about 10-15 minutes further away from the city for a home and the commute for this townhome is very close to that maximum we are willing to travel to work, any further would definitely be burdensome.

Again, any thoughts are appreciated! Just looking for a vibe check from the reddit community.",20,5,1712,314,0

FHA Loan - Broken window in shed. Need solutions for appraisal.,"Hey! Hoping for some quick advice and solutions.

In 2 to 3 days I’ll be having an appraisal and I just was reminded a window in the shed is broken. Not cracked, but broken from what I recall.

We thought originally being a non living space it for sure shouldn’t be a big deal. But I just found where it seems FHA doesn’t care about this use of the structure, broken window, needs to be fixed unless just cracked. 

Aside from replacing the entire window and frame for an updated window or just the window pane, what else is acceptable?

What if I literally take the window pane that’s broken out and don’t replace it? I assume I of course need to board it up inside and/or outside. What about if I just board it up inside and/or out and don’t take out the broken pane of glass?

Need to try and find a quick solution as fixing the window isn’t an option til Monday it sounds like. I don’t know I even care about replacing the window. I need to go and see it myself to recall as I don’t have enough pictures of the structure and from what I see no windows are broken, but I can’t see much clearly in the low quality photos used.

Update 1: I went this morning and checked it out. There are some windows broken that someone tapped over pretty well, which I know isn’t part of any FHA guidelines I found, but just simply saying. There don’t appear to be any real dangers from these broken panes. 2 appear broken and 2 appear to just be something small went through at a high velocity and so there’s just a small hole and cracked around it. 2 windows are completely missing and 1 whole window is covered and another 2 panes missing in a window of line 8 panes of glass are covered.

Update 2: I had the broken glass panes removed. Should be satisfactory for the appraisal to pass. May get noted but will be fixed next week.",63,11,1820,341,0

Fallen in love with a house which is great size, characterful, modernish (despite the longe diner), gorgeous well developed south facing garden and decking area, big bedrooms and lovely road with outstanding schools….. however it has a large lounge / diner and no other rooms downstairs.

Some folks from my work thing are booking a Cusco - MP - Cusco all in one day tour, but at $400 USD pp, it felt pretty steep to us. I'm hoping to put together a more budget-friendly plan.

Does it make sense to:

* Book ahead and take the 16:30 Bus + Train from Wanchaq to Aguascalientes (""Machu Picchu station"") on 9 November ($52pp)

* Book a ho(s)tel in AC for 9 Nov
* Try and find a guide in AC on the day, to take us up to MP on Circuit 2 on 10 November
* Book transit ahead and go back to Cusco on 10 November
* Book accommodation in Cusco for 10 November
* Try and find a tour, in Cusco, on 11 November to take us to Manu, likely leaving in the early AM 12 November and returning 15 November?

Any recommendations on tour companies for Manu? I was looking at [Manu Wildlife Peru](https://manuwildlifeperu.com/parque-manu-peru-tour-manu-area-peru/), [Quechua Expeditions](https://www.quechuasexpeditions.com/manu-jungle-holiday-4d3nclassic/) and [Amazon Peru Travellers](https://www.amazonperutravellers.com/manu_national_park_cultural_zone_4days.html). The last one is notable for being about $200 cheaper pp than most of the rest of them, which is great but also curious...

Is it feasible to see MP and Manu in one trip?

Are we missing something critical if we only do those two, if we only have a week?

Any recommendations very, very welcome.",52,10,1999,308,1
What is the seller looking for? Can they back out of a sale after closing,"My friend (Katie) has a family member (Marie) that lives on 5+ acres and sold one acre to Katie. 

The land is land locked and it took Katie over **5 years,** 50K in law fees and an easement agreement to get the land approved for construction by the town. 

Marie agreed to sell for 200k, the land is valued at 400K. She is borrowing another 600k for the construction on the land. Homes similar to the one she is building go for about 1.5 mill. The closing process took place about a month ago and money has been disbursed by the lender for construction.

Marie now wants to back out with no real reasoning, or explanation. Katie said that the only way would be if Marie sues her.  She has spent plenty of resources to bring this project to a reality and now deed and all are under her name. 

What options does Marie have at this point? My friend does not want to lawyer up unnecessarily early. Just trying to get an idea of what recourse can  Marie pull from?....",73,15,965,182,0
Maximize Cash Flow Vs Early Payoffs,"Hi 👋 I’m thinking about evaluating paying off my soon to be 5 mortgages early vs maximizing cash flow for peace of mind. Breakdown would be that I have 4 rentals and my house that each have a loan on them. Most of the loans will be split in half as I bought them with my parents so 50/50. And we have a mix of houses and new mobile homes. Just seeing if there might be anything I’m not considering or missing here.

House- $190K
RP1 (cash out refinance)- $48K my half
RP2 new mobile home, land already paid for - $53K
RP3 new mobile home, land already paid for - $19K my half 
RP4 house (loan is about to close for this next week)- $160K

Mortgage costs, interest %, and rents:
House- $1200 &amp; 3.95%
RP1- $450 &amp; 9.29% &amp; $700 for my half’s 
RP2- $700 &amp; 9.29% &amp; $1400 
RP3- $300 &amp; 10.17% &amp; $750 for my half’s 
RP4- $650 &amp; 7.63% &amp; $800 for my half’s (estimate on how much it will be able to be rented at)

Am I being Petty?,"I made an offer on a house at asking price with max concessions which was about $17k.  The seller verbally agreed to $14k in concessions.  The seller agreed at 12:30pm on Monday.  We signed the agreement and sent it for the seller signature, the seller called my agent at 7:00pm and stated that his partner won’t agree to $14k his partner wants $5K in concessions.  I’m flabbergasted because how could we possibly go from 14 to 5 in a matter of hours.  I tried to negotiate, and offered 12k and a final offer of 10k in concessions if signed on Monday.  The seller declined.  The seller then came back on Saturday morning, saying they would accept $10K.  I told my agent that I would need to go back to our original deal of 14K because I had moved on and made an offer on a different house.  My agent said the seller was angry and that he had to urge his partner to take 10k.  I was already compromising too much with 10k so with another option, I figured it wasn’t worth it to back track for anything less than 12k, the seller angrily declined. I just want to know if you think I was being petty? The truth of the matter is the house was originally listed, overpriced and it was taken down and re-listed at a more reasonable price and the concessions are because the taxes on the house are some of the highest I’ve ever seen for the area and I would have to reimburse them for 6 months that they paid.  I didn’t want to come out of pocket with that much.  I believe the house is going to sit until the spring unless they offer the concessions or cut the price again.  I believe the seller will learn the hard way. It’s unfortunate because it is a very nice house, I’m a little sad we couldn’t come to a deal but I felt like I needed to stand firm on my decision not to take $10k after that day. The house I offered on is bigger, has more space and a cheaper so I can live with my decision.",17,4,1889,377,0
My realtor can’t remember my (common) name or spell it right ,"My first name is common, and my last name is common enough. Both names are fairly short (7 letter first name, 6 letter last name) and spelled the usual way. Neither name is from a different region or country or would somehow be unfamiliar to my realtors, who are also raised in the same city and background as I am and speak the same native language as I do. Like, no f*cking excuse here. 

Realtors are a husband/wife duo. 

I’m pretty sure one realtor showed up drunk to a July showing but I couldn’t prove it. Given that I’m a recovering alcoholic, I have a little credibility in knowing if someone is toasted and reeks of booze though. Couldn’t prove it so I didn’t feel like I could get out of my contract. I moved past this red flag, regrettably. 

I finally got an offer after 4 months on the market. The counter they drew up was FULL of spelling errors, my name was misspelled repeatedly, and only a quarter of the things we talked about were in it. I literally just sent them a text telling them to try again, and that I expected a higher standard of work. Frankly, I was not nice about it. 

Again, while this is unprofessional af, I don’t think I can break my contract over it and we’re literally at the counteroffer stage. 

But I’m paying them 3% of $1.1m, and…yeah, I’m hurt they can’t even spell my name after months. 

I’ve never bugged them after hours, always respected their expertise, never contacted them while they were on vacation, and encouraged work life balance. I tend to generally strike people as quiet and polite, so this is really out of character for me and I know I’m feeling the heightened emotions of selling my farm. I’m devastated to sell, but their unprofessional approach is making everything SO much worse. 

They’re also putting a ton of pressure on me to make decisions quickly. They still excluded something minor because they thought it was petty that I’d ask for curtains. They complained about adding a page to the addendum. I’m paying them $33k. I feel like for $33k they can write a few extra sentences and get it right? 

When the realtor called tonight to say she was sending over the counter, she called me by the entirely wrong name and laughed about it. There’s still one instance in the contract where my name is misspelled because I was too sad and burnt out to even bother asking for a correction. 

I don’t even want to pay them and I’m 10 seconds from backing out of a full-price cash offer or sabotaging the whole thing. I won’t, because I’m an adult, but damn I want to. 

How…do I handle this professionally? ",61,12,2570,467,0

Winter Scandinavia Interrail Trip,"Hi reddit!

Next winter i want to do an Interrail trip Through Scandinavia, i want to visit al the Scandinavian countries and i want to go up to the polecircle. The plan im having now is to go from Copenhagen, all the way north, up over the gulf of Bothnia and back to Helsinki where ill catch a flight to The Netherlands where i live. Thing is that im kind of planning my trip to see what my options are, and i could use a little help i think...

  
My plan now is celebrate new years in Copenhagen. I did that as well last year and it was so much fun. Back then i had the same idea to go to the pole circle by train but found Copenhagen so much fun that i didn't go any further north. Anyway, after Copenhagen i want to visit Stockholm, because that is where the night train to Narvik in Norway departs. After that im a bit lost. I would really like to visit Narvik because a friend told me its nice and its in the polecircle.  From there to Haperanda where i can take the bus into Finland to Kemi where a train runs to Helsinki.  

Have you guys got any recommendations for my trip, some nice cities (especially nightlife and i know thats a bit hard to find in Scandinavia haha) or some nice rail routes. I would also like to know a bit more about trains and good train connections, and if they are punctual and reliable during winter.

"Someone left an anonymous note on our door: ""To The Family Who Lives In This House...""","Before my wife and I bought our home in 2021, we were in the market for a fixer-upper. We wanted a neglected house with good bones, a place where we could add value and character.

We found that home in southwest Austin and for the past three years have steadily worked on it during the occasional weekend and free afternoon.

One project at a time, we’ve tried to transform the home from a neglected place into a warm and beautiful one. I painted the entire exterior this past spring. We ripped up an old (trip-hazard-prone) sidewalk leading to the door and replaced it with a modern walkway. We replaced the ugly boxy bushes and with a wide variety of plants. Not to mention, most of the updates have been indoors: paint, new bathrooms and kitchen, etc. It's been a lot of work.

Well, this morning the anonymous note appeared on our door.

In summary, they said they’ve driven by our house for years. They watched us transform the yard, paint the home, and just give the house new life. The note was their way of thanking us for brightening the neighborhood.

People are so kind. This simple note made my whole week. I'll hold onto it forever.

Flip or Rental Property?,"My husband (42) and I (37) really want to get into the real estate game. We purchased a book about rental properties and have been studying it so that when we find the right property, we can start our real estate journey. Then someone told me I should flip houses and now we can’t decide the best route for our first time purchase. Flipping is riskier but earns more money sooner, while rental property is longevity. It’s so important that we do this right the first time and not go into financial ruin. 

What did you guys do first?

Context: We live in Los Angeles and can’t afford anything here, so we are looking to purchase in the midwest, and that adds a bit of complexity to managing the property and project.

13 Day Itinerary Check - Switzerland,"Hello! I tend to be an overly type A, ambitious person when it comes to traveling because I want to see everything I possibly can. I also love planning and making itineraries.

We averaged 30,000 steps a day in Japan last year and survived, so we're ok with non-relaxing days. However, my husband has asked me to not to a repeat of what I did for our 2018 UK trip, which involved 700 miles of driving and 8 hotel stays in 12 days (even though I maintain that trip was epic) - but I'm trying to be more chill!

I've also read in several other threads that you have to be more flexible in Switzerland since you're at the mercy of the weather and be ok with changing plans.

I was hoping to get some feedback on this itinerary - one thing to note, I personally love old churches, castles, architecture, and just walking around city centers - which is why some of these specific items have been included. And my husband is an HR Giger fan (beyond the Alien movies). We are aware of the mixed reviews of the museum, but still want to fit that in. But even with all this, I have such fear of missing out on some of the hiking opportunities - I'm so torn.

We're aiming for mid-late May 2025. Thank you in advance!

Leaseback question,"Hi agents! 

My siblings and I inherited a high end property. ($7-10 million, waterfront).  

We disagree about when to sell it. I want to enjoy one last summer with the property and then put up for sale. They want to put up for sale ASAP. 

They are offering the compromise that we put up for sale now but make sale contingent on leaseback through the summer. 

I am amenable to this, but worried a buyer will not like this contingency and pressure us to drop it and then everyone will pressure me to drop it and then I’ll be the bad guy for scuttling the deal. 

Can you share your experience on contingencies like this? Do buyers tend to respect them?

Help! Bought home two years ago and it’s a nightmare ,"Two years ago I purchased a home with my spouse. This was our first home and we were uneducated about the process. I wish we would have chosen a different realtor. 

We found a house that we liked. Our realtor explained that they had redone the foundation and that he was impressed with the renovation. He gave us a list of inspectors. Nothing was flagged in the report but minor things that the seller agreed to fix. Come closing our realtor does not attend due to “being busy showing another property”. 

We’re in our home for about four months when we start to notice cracks forming on our walls. We contacted a structural engineer who told us that the foundation repairs did not go deep enough and that the roots from our neighbor’s tree is destroying our house. 

We rented a trench and placed root guard but that did not help the problem. We also got a hose and water the foundation 2x a day.

We've looked into a HELOC and it looks like it's going to take anywhere from 4-6 weeks to get one. Unfortunately we don't have that kind of time, and we don't want to put everything on our 20% interest credit cards.

I'm curious-What are some options others have pursed in this type of situation?",21,3,632,114,0

How do I get out of a contract when term can’t be met?,5 days ago my house went under contract however 12 hours after being under contract the buyers agent wanted me to up my sales price by 15k so her buyers could put their closing cost in. I said no what if it doesn’t appraise for that much. We are already under contract for them to pay their closing cost. I just dont want to inflate my price that much. It’s a bit excessive. Well now that I said no and that if she can’t go by the contract then sign a release and be done with it and give the buyers their emd. The agent wouldn’t sign it and now she is pretty much hold my house hostage till I cave and accept her new conditions. She can hold my house up for a month. There is no way her clients can come up with the closing costs which I feel bad for them truly I do but I can’t afford to pay their closing costs and mine. What can I do? Is there any hope for me or do I just have to wait till it expires?,54,13,906,188,0

Buyers agent rate.," I have been researching homes in my area for a few months and have found a home that checks all the boxes. However the seller was nearly in foreclosure and had some projects that some contractors didn't finish because the seller didn't have the money to pay them. 

I was planning on buying a home without a realtor but since this is my first time and I figured it would be good to have someone in my corner so I get a recommendation for a realtor for a friend.  I am planning to pay cash for the house because the seller already has an offer and it's contingent on the potential buyers selling their own home.  The other potential buyer will have 72hrs to match.

  
The realtor I contacted me sent me a buyer agreement that has a 3% fee that can come out of my pocket if the seller doesn't meet the 3%. This seems high to me and I would think 1.5-2% would be more appropriate considering I have yet to meet the agent and they haven't showed me any homes or are facilitating financing.

  
Should I ask for 1.5-2%, look at another realtor or hire a real estate lawyer to draft the offer? This house is the only one I've found in months that checks all the boxes I'm looking for and with the other offer I can't waste any time.  Thanks for any advice.",18,3,1252,244,0

Closing Costs (IL),"I'm currently contingent in the home buying process, and have inspectors coming next week. Little $50K one story house in the country. My income isn't great but going from nearly $1K rent to a $500 mortgage (into a house I can one day sell etc) is nice. But as someone who is young and knows little about the homebuying process, these loan closing costs are rediculous. $6K, which is around 12% of the total loan, not to mention close to half my savings, just to acquire the loan is really offputting. By that logic I have to go well past 2 years of mortgage as opposed to my rent just to make back the wallet hole that the closing costs open up, not to even mention the repair costs the home may need.

"Buying at a county run foreclosure auction, what do I need to know?","My parents are considering buying a home at a county auction.

How much should I offer?,"I need help please!! I'm a first gen homebuyer and I finally found a property I'm interested in and I don’t want to mess this up 🥲 I don’t have anyone guiding me and I would love some advice if possible.

Any recommendations for loans against a mobile home pre 1976?,"My fiance and I have been together for quite some time, we’re currently living at my moms helping pay the mortgage until we find where we want to go. Over the time we’ve become close with the elderly neighbor who happens to own two properties, her own mobile home, and her first house which is a 1972 buddy trailer permanently affixed and deemed as a “manufactured home with a permanent real property”. Her husband passed not horribly long ago and she’s tired of the upkeep as she’s kept it mint for 50 years along with the added bills and headaches with only one real income now. We saw the home a few days ago and are fixated on it, it’s perfect for what we need for only $98k rather than the median around here of $350k. Even has a proper shed big enough and equipped to supplement my electronics repair business. 

Spoke to a mortgage broker who has one potential guy to make a deal but in the worst case said he will help us through with a more subpar loan office. I found online things like 21st mortgage corporation, Vanderbilt mortgage, new horizon mortgage, and black rock and he agreed it’s not preferable but if it’s the only option it may be worth it for us simply due to being a steal for the property. (My area has boomed over the last few years since Covid, was valued at 109k several years back) and like I said condition is mint as it was sentimental no expenses spared whatsoever and a clean 4 point inspection they did just to ensure it was staying mint.

Any recommendations from here? I’m just so hyped up about this process but being the weekend the time doesn’t move really at all and I’m also worried about losing out if nobody wants to give us a fair shot without insane interest atleast. Of course like I said it is a mobile home but permanently affixed with the Florida documents to prove so.",61,10,1819,336,0
Brussels is Terrible,"Brussels was... underwhelming 

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels. 

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.  

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert. 

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck. 

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? ",20,3,2737,493,1

Our current rental has 3 stories and stairs to get outside from every door. Our dog is getting older. He’s stumbled up/down the stairs a couple of times and it breaks our hearts. I WFH most days and he is my shadow. 

The problem is, to buy a house in a similar (slightly less expensive area) like Pasadena, we would have to significantly downgrade space and home quality. We found a home 900 sq. ft. And built in 1930, 2 bed/1 bath but great, but it has a nice fenced in yard, a garage for him to work in and a shed for extra storage. That mortgage would be the same as staying in our current rental (assuming that price doesn’t go up). 

My husband has worked on houses most of his life and could make upgrades to a fixer upper. 

What do we do? Is it worth downsizing and hitting potentially large fixes to own a home? 

EDIT: the home for sale is an incredible deal for the condition and location of the home. We haven't found anything like it in the year we've been looking. It's one of the best case scenarios for our budget. Maryland has ridiculously expensive housing (especially where I work close to DC). Listed less than 24 hours and had two offers. So we know it is a lucky find. Offer deadline today.

EDIT2: We made a competitive offer on the house, but it was not selected. They accepted a cash offer instead. Thanks for all the advice and support. ",72,15,1832,341,0

Melatonin for kid jetlag.,"Flying out from Mid West (US) to Southeast Asia in a week. Flight takes off @4pm and arrives @ 8pm, 15+ hrs flight. We will stay a night for the 18hr layover, then another 4 hr flight to BKK, arrives at 5pm local time. I will be traveling with a 7 years old who last on a plane was 4 years ago. He also took a 15+ hr flight to Asia  when he was 1. No jetlag lag issue back then because my son as a toddler took  multiple naps throughout the day. This time, I am concerned. I got some kid melatonin for this trip. I don't know if he will be jetlagged but wondered when should I let him start taking it? How's about coming back to the states? When we return, we will arrive at 4ish afternoon local time.

Need Advice on first home investing. ,"Thoughts on first home 

Advice on our first home! 


Good afternoon everyone! 

Was looking for some advice on what my wife and I should do with our first home. We have a unique situation and want to make the most of it. 

We currently live on the Big Island of Hawaii and bought our first home from my wife’s uncle approximately 1 year ago. The house was in rough condition and they ended up selling it to us for what they bought it for back in 2008 $650,000. They are also the ones financing the loan via seller financing. We went through all the legal steps such as escrow etc etc and have a legal contract that they will finance it to us a 5% for the next 5-10 years. 

At the end of the contract and/or the interest rates drop below 5% we will need to refinance with a bank. 

The Zillow estimate of the house is approximayely 1.6 million. We’ve put a lot of work into the house by ourselves and will continue to do so as finances and time provide. 

We’ve been discussing moving to the mainland due to cost of living and being closer to my family. What should we do with our house? Would selling be the best option and buying outright in the mainland with our profit.

What about HELOC? And then renting the residence? 

What are your thoughts? Appreciate the input ",37,7,1273,238,0
Unlawful Eviction?,"Hello everyone, I’m quite new to Reddit so I’m sorry mods if I do/say anything that breaks this groups rules.

With that, I have been living in an apartment with my brother since February. When we moved in they wouldn’t even allow me a resident key fob until I was “on the lease.” I say resident key because this place rents half its units out as hotel. Anyways, these documents were printed and signed by both of us and turned in to this sketchy leasing agent who I’m now finding had been pulling strings for my brother since the beginning. Pretty much I come back after being gone for awhile to being locked out and told I’m not on the lease. I have the document and now that I look closer the leasing agent NEVER signed them after we turned them in to, in return, screw me over if my brother ever wanted me out without saying anything to me. He’s said a spew of lies like i was a squatter and things yet I have the proof of payments to him for every month I was there. My main question is, is this legal that he just didn’t sign them? This agents exact words were “it never went through.” I didn’t get it exactly at the time because of the crazy situation I found myself in, but with that said I have the documents of at least both me and my brother agreeing at that time and it being signed and submitted over 6 months ago. I have contacted a city attorney for what they call a special order made to be given to the police to then escort me back into the apartment and regain access. So, before I waste these cops time, do I have every right to re enter and confront this dumb agent or better yet the property manager/owner to reactivate my key? I’ve never heard of this type of stuff, nor do I get involved with legal issues in general hence me reaching out to this subreddit. Any advice moving forward with this would help, thank you guys.",18,2,1845,353,0

I have both travel insurance and travel benefits from my credit card - claim with both?,"Hi there, long time reader, first time writer :) I can't for the life of me find any information on this on the web and will call someone tomorrow. Just thought I'd throw it out there now and see if anyone has experienced this before:

I bought everything for the vacation I'm on right now with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card but also bought a travel insurance plan with Seven Corners (forgetting that I had travel perks with the CC). I do need to file a claim now for a medical issue that caused a delay to me starting my trip. 

My question is... Is there a known order of operations regarding this? Do I have to file a claim with my travel insurance first and then file with Chase? Should I only pick one to claim with? Or do I file it simultaneously with both because it's not a guarantee that either will pay out fully? 

Not wanting to commit any fraud but also not trying to wait for months to find out one won't pay either. I would definitely not double dip if I got it approved by both, but how do you prevent that if you file with both? Just trying to see how to maximize my claims approval since I'm double covered..so why not?

Need advice on high % rate home,"In 2023, I purchased my home for $840K. It’s a townhome with no HOA. Looks brand new because it’s built in 2014.

I refinanced the property down to 6.125% earlier this year - my mortgage is now $6.1K. Our income is $550K+ so we can definitely afford this but it’s a liability. Not an investment property. We are also under 30 so I think renting makes more sense agility wise.

I’m unable to rent this house for more than the mortgage in this location. There are a couple of ways to go from here:

1. Do a long term rental close to $5K, be at a loss of $1K+. Rent somewhere else for $3ish K. Still save $2K/$24K yearly. 

2. Do a short term rental but would have to actively manage it for 500 hours at least to qualify for any tax benefits. We both work quite demanding jobs so would prefer to stay passive.

3. Wait till rates drop further before we refinance. If it becomes an investment property, there will be a 0.5-1% on top of the lower rate.

The property is in purgatory. The county can't sell it since no one wants to buy it. They tried to give it to the fortfeited land commission and they wouldn't take it.

Buyers closing attorney asking for mom's marital status for an estate sale doesn't seem to think,"I am selling a house for my grandmother who passed away that is part of an estate that was probated. 

I am the executor authorized by the court. I have the letters of testamentary. I am also the beneficiary of her assets. 

The will reads like this: If my mother was married at the time my grandmother passed away the house would go to me. If she was not married at the time of my grandmothers passing we would split it. My grandmother talked to my mom about this before her passing so my mom knew. 

My mom is married and was married at the time my grandmothers passing. 

I gave the closing attorney her marital status.

4 days basically 3 days before closing and right before a weekend at the end of the day on a Friday, the closing attorney suddenly reaches out to my realtor (not me) and asked if she could have my mother send them an email with her marital status. After I had been corresponding with them for a week and half. The realtor knows my mom so she called her and asked her what was going on. 

I understand everyone is probably covering their butts given that it is a unique situation and in general there is a lot of fraud out there. They would probably be less likely to question it if my grandmother had left everything to my mom because that's usually the normal order of things. 

I think that it's weird and a little shady they waited so long to bring this up and then they went behind my back and asked the realtor to call my mom like they didn't believe me even though there were court documents to prove. 

I have a good relationship with my mom but what if I didn't? There is a reason why my grandmother wanted me to handle this instead of my mom. 

That could be a huge ordeal if I did not have a good relationship with my mom. 

Anyone experience with this type of thing or have any thoughts? Do I need to provide this? 

Because they waited until a Friday it's too late to contact the estate attorney that wrote her will now and ask questions.

Best place to travel cost-benefic for someone earning $MXN,"Hello everyone!

I’m looking for travel recommendations, considering I’m based in Mexico and earn in Mexican pesos (MXN).

Some preferences:

	•	We both love beach destinations and sporting events/places.
	•	Open to both domestic (Mexico) and international destinations.
	•	We enjoy outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and trying local food.
	•	Safety is also an important factor.

Brother in Law wants a buy out for the family home,"Hello all-

I reside in a multi-generational home that my partner grew up in. The owner of the home is my partner's elderly grandmother who is still alive. There is still a mortgage on the home that we have agreed to pay once Grandma passes. Recently, our brother in law approached me and said something about ""buying out"" his share when the Gradmother passes away. This topic has never been discussed at any point in us living here nor prior to us moving in. We honestly cannot afford to buy out all of the siblings, either through cash or remortgage. The home is set to be inherited by my partner's mother in the will but discussions have recently started taking place about changing the will to reflect ownership split 5 ways (mother and 4 children).  Interestingly, said brother in law has recently ""befriended"" the elderly Grandmother and has become her confidant. This all smells a little fishy to me and seems like brother in law is looking for a way to make some extra cash (the house is valued in the millions).  I have done some research and found out that all inheriting parties have to agree how they want to handle the property after the death of the owner, but that one partner can ""force"" the sale if the parties remain indecisive. I'm fine with selling and using our share for a down payment elsewhere but my partner and his mother do not want to sell as they both grew up in the home. This long story leads me to my question: can one party ""force"" the people who want to live in the home to buy them out and if not what are our options if this gets ugly after Grandma passes away?

Iberia Missed Connection and Cancelled Flight ,"Hello Everyone, 

Long time lurker and first time poster looking for some guidance please. 

I'll start with some background on the issue including the flight details which may give some more colour. If you need any more information just let me know. 

I booked a return flight from Manchester to Lima from 16th September to 30th September 2024 with a change in Madrid on each leg.

Flight there was all fine but on the flight home we were delayed 2hr50 out of Lima on September 29th (IB6650) which meant we landed  2hr55 after our initial landing time and missed our connecting flight out of Madrid to Manchester on 30th (IB3692) .

We were told there was no other flights out of Madrid to Manchester or even  the UK that day (30th) so put up in Madrid Airport Suites Hotel for the night with dinner, breakfast and lunch vouchers given by Iberia. We were also booked on a flight out of Madrid the next day (1st Oct) on flight IB3174 to London Heathrow with a new connection flight to Manchester (BA1400). 

We got to the airport nice and early but were told around 30 minutes before takeoff that flight IB3174 to London Heathrow was now also cancelled with again no other flight to the UK available that day. This meant we were ultimately put up in the Madrid Airport Suites Hotel again for one more night on Oct 1. After some back and forth we managed to swap our next new flight from a 16.10 to Manchester via Iberia on 2nd October (IB3692 again) to a connecting flight through Brussels that would get us there just after 10am (SN3732 + SN2173). 

Ultimately, we left Lima on Sunday evening and returned to Manchester on Wednesday morning. 

Now obviously I believe I am due some compensation here but I just wanted some guidance on what exactly for. Am I in a position to claim for both the missed connection and then also my alternative flight to Heathrow the next day which got cancelled?

I know Iberia put us up in a hotel but I think you can agree a 3 day delay is unacceptable. I will also add the hotel given was absolutely appalling, including the food for which we didn't even use the vouchers for in the end it was that bad. The transfer to the hotel was so unreliable both in terms or frequency and capacity that we also had to just grab an uber on one occasion since that many people wanted to use it. I was hesitant to mention this last part in case it gives the wrong idea as it isn't an issue in itself but the hotel also seemed to  be currently used for asylum seekers too based on reviews and the fact we saw the Red Cross present with large groups of guests. Furthermore our second night back to the hotel we were greeted by a large road block by the police right outside the hotel who were checking every car coming and going. Obviously something had happened but reception wouldn't tell us what. Honestly it's embarrassing Iberia uses this hotel and Melia has its name attached to it. 

This is all on top of some things which I know will be difficult to quantify and claim for, such as extra cattery expenses, unpaid leave from work and the mental toll and stress caused to me and my partner during the delay.

Would someone be able to point me in the best direction in order to reach some sort of resolution here in terms of compensation? This has never happened to me before so I'm a bit lost as to where I go. Would I raise it directly through Iberia to start? No reason or explanation has ever been given for the delays or cancellation and we told just take it to the Iberia desk to sort in the airport. 

Appreciate any help you can give and as I say if you need any more information please just let me know.

Selling my house: Commission vs flat fee agent,"Here is the situation. I’m getting ready to sell my house in Salt Lake City and trying to decide between two agents. 

One is a traditional agent and would charge 2.25% (perhaps would even negotiate down to 2%). This includes pictures + staging + open house. We’ve met a few times and I really like him. He has a vision for how to prep the house, what things to fix, etc etc. 

The other is a flat fee agent. Cost is $3200 - $200 to list and then $3000 upon closing. That includes pictures, no staging, open house if I want one (he says open houses are mostly for curious neighbors and people trying to steal stuff). Also a nice guy and has a little less of a salesman vibe. 

I bought the house two years ago and am moving sooner than I expected. I would love to make a profit but more realistically I just want to break even. I paid $570k for it. Both agents suggest we list around ~$610k. I think that’s a little lofty and expect to get around 590-600k. 

With the commission agent I think once you add in buyers agent, closing costs and concessions, i think I’ll be taking a loss at anything under $600k. The flat fee agent gives me a bit more wiggle room. I think around $590k is my break even. 

I want to sell quickly - we are moving and signed a lease that starts October 1 so I want to minimize paying mortgage and rent. 

My heart says to go with the commission agent - he is super experienced and caring and I think will help get the house looking its best for the listing. My brain says to go with the flat fee agent - seems way more financially prudent. Both agents have good reviews. 

 Any advice on how to decide? The flat fee seems like too good of a deal to be true… what sort of risks am I not seeing?",46,8,1720,335,0
Contact info removed from luggage tag?,"Hi, all! I tried googling this to minimal success but it struck me as odd enough that I figured I’d ask here.

I had a United States domestic round trip (SAN to AUS and back, both nonstop) in the past week on Southwest. I checked a single bag through the kiosks, quick and painless, nothing in there except for clothing and toiletries. I have a luggage tag on the bag, and you have to fully undo the luggage tag to put the piece of paper with the contact info on it into the tag. When I picked it up from the baggage carousel in AUS, the contact info paper was missing, but the luggage tag was still attached, which means someone had to take the tag off, take the contact paper out, and put the tag back on. There was no TSA inspection slip in the luggage.

"Tax implications around gifting cryptocurrency for a home loan, and sketchy sounding suggestion from lending officer.","My ex-spouse is trying to buy a home, and as a favor to benefit our kids, I offered to gift them an amount of Bitcoin to help with the down payment. My reasoning for gifting Bitcoin instead of USD is because if I were to sell the asset myself, the capital gains taxes would be much higher for me, since I file taxes as single and my income puts me in a higher tax bracket than them (they file as head of household, and have a significantly lower income). If I were to sell the asset myself, I would need to sell a significant amount more than I am willing to in order to cover the taxes on the amount that I offered for help with the down payment. I also do not want to deal with reporting capital gains income on my taxes this year, since I wasn't planning on selling any Bitcoin for my own profit this year.

I was very clear of this with them from the beginning, that I would be gifting them an asset for them to sell on their own. The lender then requested that I send it as USD, which I am not going to do, as explained above. I was then told later that if I were to gift them the cryptocurrency, the mortgage lender would require me to provide bank statements and financial records dating all the way back to when I originally purchased the bitcoin, and all transfers since then, showing the origins of the asset. I was not aware that they needed to do this, and frankly, I'm not comfortable with this. I'm not even sure how I would do this, since I've owned the asset since 2015 and it has been transferred through many different accounts / wallets, and I'm not even sure that I have the records that go back that far (I realize that I will likely need to do this at some point in the future when I want to sell this asset, but it's not something that I want to do right now, as my plans have always been to hold onto the asset for a long time). I asked why they needed to do this, and the lender told me that they need to verify the source of the funds for the loan, and it being crypto adds more complexity to this.

Here's the part that causes concern for me:

The lender then suggested an alternative way to provide the bitcoin gift, which sounds ""fishy"" to me. They are requesting that I gift my ex the bitcoin directly to their wallet. Then they sell it on an exchange and withdraw the proceeds to their bank account. Then they would write a cashiers check to me, which I would deposit into my bank account, and then I would write another cashiers check back to them as a gift. From what I'm understanding, is that if I provide them with a cashiers check for the gift, it doesn't require me to provide any financial documents for verification.

To me that sounds sketchy, and I'm not sure if that has tax reporting implications on my end, or if it could be cause for concern if I am ever audited in the future. Could it be see seen as fraud, laundering, or tax evasion if the IRS were ever to audit me or them?

Should I go forward with jumping through those hoops? Or does it sound like it could leave me exposed down the road if I'm ever to be audited? I only made this offer in the beginning under the assumption that it would be a simple gift of an asset and wouldn't cause tax reporting concerns, or open me or them up to exposure during an audit. I'm trying to be extremely careful when it comes to taxes, because I do own cryptocurrency, and want to do my due diligence on reporting when it comes time to sell these assets for my own profit.

Thank you.

Hawaii Flights Question - DEN vs. SFO Transfer,"Hi everyone,

Looking to travel from Canada (major city) to Hawaii this summer (2025). Was wondering if anyone could over some advice on this particular dilemma we are in:

* Flight #1: has a layover in Denver that is 2 hours. We have had past experience in other countries where we have almost missed our flight on layovers that have been even longer than that. We don't really want to experience that kind of stress again. This flight is also somewhere between $300 to $800 cheaper than the next one. We don't trust airlines when it comes to delays and don't want to miss our flight as that would cost us infinitely more money.
* Flight #2: has a layover in San Francisco that is 6.5 hours. It is significantly more expensive than the previous one and would really boring for the 4 of us travelling, which include 2 adults and 2 teenagers who can be extremely fidgety and high energy at times.

*Please note all prices are in Canadian dollars.*

Now, here's the ultimate question. Should we do Flight #1 or Flight #2? The ultimate breaker would be if we have to go through Canadian Customs or not during our layover in Denver. I know that YYZ often does customs for the US, but someone (my fellow Torontarians) please confirm! Also is there any app or ETA that we can use to get around customs at an USA airport? Also does anyone know Denver airport well? Would we have to switch terminals in order to get to the domestic departures gate from the international arrivals gate? I know they have 6 terminals, but please also let us know the fastest method to get there and how long it would take. Thanks!",46,8,1603,287,1
Krakow Travel Report,"**Arrival:**

My visit to Kraków took place on an overcast few days in early October 2024. I'd set aside three days for the city and a day trip to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. The appeal was the affordability of the trip and a curiosity to visit a Polish city and learn more about Polish culture, the WW2 history at Auschwitz-Birkenau (the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers) was also a factor in the decision to go. Many Poles choose to come to work and live in my country of residence; and I reciprocally desired to gain an understanding of their cultural background.

Alighting at the train station and walking past Barbakan (est. 1498) and through St. Florian's Gate (c. 1307) was an impressive entrance to the city. It was about 10pm at this point and as we walked down Floriańska (St. Florian's Street), I quickly noticed a number of dolled up young women standing in the middle of the street holding black umbrellas in the light rainy drizzle, looking around at bypassers. Was this prostitution or something else? Not the best first impression, but I am aware that soliciting for prostitution is legal in Poland and their laws on the matter are more lax. Sadly, in my opinion this does colour public spaces with a sleazy vibe, I think such activities should be kept out of sight especially in such a thoroughfare not far from the main square. Even at night. I did not notice any police presence monitoring these apparent activities.

**Day 1:**

Fast forward to the next day and we started by walking through part of the charming ‘Planty park’ (a circular park which encompasses the entire Old Town district), noticing an amusing overabundance of park benches. Unfortunately there were no big central parks or highly curated green areas besides this. We then hauled ourselves up a gradual slope to ascend Wawel Hill to the castle and cathedral. This is considered the most culturally important site in Poland. After having a quick stroll around the imposing Italian-style castle courtyard, we chose to enter the (nearly 1,000 year-old) cathedral via the audio-guided tour, which was not too costly. Sadly the cathedral tower was heavily scaffolded which tarnished the view. The audioguide headsets conveniently triggered different audio clips as you walk around the site, which meant you didn't have to key in numbers. Wawel Cathedral is where Polish monarchs were formerly crowned and buried. The monarchy was abolished on 25th November 1795. It's a shame that the Polish monarchy has ended as I find national interest in its own intelligentsia and ruling class to be a showcase of heroism, statecraft, and political leadership through the centuries. Although I acknowledge the valid criticism of the notion of monarchy.

From the outside, the cluster of different architectural additions over the centuries is intriguing to see, particularly the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel (1533) which was beautiful and is considered the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps, dedicated to the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty. It's worth noting that the site was getting quite busy and numerous tour groups were congregating and piling through the cathedral. Because it was a relatively small cathedral, this crowding did feel slightly uncomfortable (but still manageable) at times. There were no photos permitted inside the cathedral. 

We ascended the steep steps of the Royal Sigismund Bell tower which led to the bell at the top and a slightly restricted view over the city through a wire barrier. There was a photo op to touch the bell's clapper, which is considered good luck. Once again it was quite busy in this space owing to the crowds, luckily there was a separate descent staircase available.

We then walked down Wawel Hill into the expansive 13th century town square (Rynek Główny), the so-called ‘biggest medieval square in Europe’ according to some sources, but Charles Square in Prague is actually two times larger FYI. Our first port of call was the free to enter Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) shopping arcade in the middle of the town square, many vendor outlets sold what looked like traditional Polish goods, in particular the amber goods typical of the region and many other figurines, souvenirs, and models. 

After this we entered the grand Brick Gothic St. Mary's Basilica which sadly had a cladding of scaffolding on the main tower due to longterm repairs, meaning ascending the tower was not possible. The interior was beautiful but it was a fairly brief experience after sitting down to soak up all the churchiness. Every hour a bugle player plays a traditional five-note bugle call (hejnał) from the basilica's tallest tower. They often wave down at the crowds below. We popped into the Muzeum Farmacji (Pharmacy Museum), it is a small museum which features a good collection of pharmacy paraphernalia, but I wasn't raving about it after a few rooms full of similar jars and pots. The information and presentation of the museum appeared to have been unchanged for many years.

Walking around Wawel Hill and the town itself, images of the Polish Pope, John Paul II (1920-2005) - born Karol Józef Wojtyła - can be seen in many places, some may even say excessively! I found it quite whimsical seeing so many portraits of JP2, even despite my reservations about the Catholic Church as an institution. You can sometimes see monks walking around the town on their daily commutes.

**Day 2:**

On our second day we hopped on a guided tour to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. The tour was well organised although the bus itself was fairly cramped. First we stopped at Auschwitz I (Stammlager), known as former administrative and operational centre of the death-camp, and we're given headsets to hear a crystal clear transmission of the guide's voice as we were taken around the site as part of the group tour. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was the more visually striking of the two sites, with the instantly recognisable gatehouse and train tracks. The Birkenau site was even bigger than I'd imagined. The barbed wire fences and guard towers tapered off into the distance, with the site covering 6,000 football pitches of space. Both sites put together were a moving warning about humanity's darkest capabilities, with well-selected and impactful exhibits. Although I could see no central dedicated museum building. We returned to Kraków, getting back at around 7pm before then going to ‘The Black Duck’ restaurant which was very good value and enjoyable (plus points for duck theming), it was hands down the culinary highlight of the trip. Walking back to our accommodation we were solicited by a prostitute, but politely turned down the offer.

**Summary:**

I found Poland quite dour. A number of the eateries we went to nearly all played melancholic music, many of the souvenir shops stock items with an intriguing tearful girl theme, combining this melancholia with a sudden rundown post-communist greyness (and countless graffitied walls) almost immediately outside of Kraków's Old Town district, the hyped up Kazimierz area is no exception to this. Alongside the city's proximity to a major former Nazi death-camp, the experience was somewhat overshadowed by these things. Of course, Poland cannot easily separate itself from this history under Soviet &amp; Nazi occupation and before that being partitioned three times (the Austrian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition) in the late 18th century leading to 123 years of no Polish sovereignty. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed. The identity and nation of the Poles has been under threat for centuries and I think this reflects in the locals' outlook and culture, they are a guarded people fiercely interested in their national identity and faith. This is a nation in the process of regaining its pride and sense of self. The creation of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, was only founded in 1989, making modern Poland only 35 years old. In 2022, Poland, Greece, and Cyprus had the highest percentage of adults in the EU at risk of depression, with a share of 65 percent. This is a country with many depressed and downhearted people, but Poland is certainly moving through a period of new beginnings.

Another thing to mention is the Cracovian road zebra crossings don't often have traffic lights. So there were a number of times I felt unsafe trusting motorists to spot me and stop to allow me to safely cross the road. With that being said there isn't a lot of traffic around Kraków and locals are encouraged to use the trams.

Tourist attractions around Kraków were okay, it's very church-heavy reflecting the Catholic way of life there. At times I felt the historical museums could have told Poland's national story more narratively and engagingly. I understand there was a golden age for Poland before the partitions and then occupations during the 20th century. This golden age roughly corresponds to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572).

However, I found the Cracovian museums to be more descriptive than narrative in tone, drily listing information rather than arranging it for a modern touristic palette. Because Poland's history is more on the niche side, I'd have hoped for a more comprehensive overview/retelling. The Rynek Underground Museum (under the town square) seemed like a tourist trap displaying a banal arrangement of rocks and pillars. I decided to avoid entry. The same can be said of the former town hall tower, the view is said to be extremely limited.

To justify a trip to Kraków I recommend spending about two days there max. You will enjoy great value for money on food and drink but the tourist sites are nothing out of this world. You should ideally combine the town with a day trip to either the salt mine or Auschwitz-Birkenau, or perhaps to the mountains nearby if you are outdoorsy (the Tatra Mountains and Zakopane, a popular resort town in the foothills of the mountains). I recommend taking in the town slowly, it shouldn't be rushed as you may quickly run out of things to do if you are not careful.

I give Kraków an overall 5.5/10.

**Souvenirs:**

I struggled to find many souvenirs/keepsakes that really caught my eye. I would recommend having a look in the Kraków Cloth Hall and the outlets on the outside of the building, although I felt much of the items for sale were almost identical between the stalls, the variety on offer was unfortunately lacking. 
I recommend checking out Niebieska Kropka Boleslawiec Pottery and the ""Kacper Ryx"" Historical Shop. I purchased a handmade fridge magnet from the latter which was fairly pricey, but had rustic appeal. I also stumbled across the Wawel Castle Souvenir shop (to the left of the courtyard entrance as you enter) and it turned out to be one of the better souvenir shops in Kraków. So do check that out.

**Food:**

None of my travel review should be considered exhaustive, but I highly recommend going to Czarna Kaczka/ Black Duck for authentic Polish cuisine. Try the Borscht (beetroot soup), it's very tasty. Also make sure you have pierogi somewhere during your visit. For breakfast I heartily recommend Milkbar Tomasza and the savoury pancake with spinach and cheese filling.",20,3,11293,1848,1

Patagonia super post Part 1 – itinerary + reviews from Bariloche and la ruta de los 7 lagos,"Hi all,

I spent a month in Patagonia during Argentina's summer, and I would like to share some thoughts, both to record my own feelings but also to potentially help others trip planning. My ideal travel style is to take my sweet time in new places, in life, to get to know them better than I would just breezing through, and I was able to set up my world this year to be able to travel in this way. If you're similar, you might get something out of what's written below.

Part 1 is on the area around Bariloche. Part 2 (or more?) will address El Bolsón, El Chaltén, and El Calafate.

In general, there's lots of blog posts I read about the smallest amount of time you can ""do,"" say, the route of the 7 lakes in, but if you are bumming around the country for a while, give yourself as much time as possible. For me, one month in Patagonia was not enough. I left some crumbs on the floor (which is totally ok, anti-conquistador mentality, just felt a bit harried/frustrated at the time...I suppose I will just have to go back some day :) more on what I would go back for later). Also remember to budget in days to do laundry, run errands, walk around town, do souvenir shopping, rain check activities, etc. I did not, because I am stupid/a robot/not in love with the practical side of life and tend to forget about my body and how I have to take care of it! Don't be me! Once you've budgeted an approximate amount of days for the things you'd like to do in any one place, I'd suggest adding more to that if you can.

Below is my initial itinerary, annotated to reflect how it changed as well as how I would change it further in ways I was unable to (because of tickets bought in advance to save money, etc.) to make it more relaxing, fun, and thorough. Used AllTrails extensively and Wikiloc sometimes to stay on track.

# Bariloche

**Day 1** – **arrive in Bariloche, buy snacks/food, settle**

**Day 2** – **Cerro Bella Vista + Goye** **✨**  
*chill warmup hike, nice views, though Cerro Goye maybe not as interesting after Cerro Bella Vista (plus infested with tábanos on the sunny day I was lucky to go). I went up from Colonia Suiza to Cerro Bella Vista first, then Cerro Goye, then backtracked and went down the same route I came up, making it out-and-back rather than a loop to keep it chill. The descent from Goye I didn't do is supposed to be a little more intense, and while I can manage intense I didn't want that for my first day. Note via bus you can only take 13B/10B around 8:30am or 13A every hour starting from 9:30am, so make sure to be where you gotta be at those times if you want an early start.*

**Day 3** – recovery day with **Sendero Los Arrayanes &gt; Lago Escondido &gt; Villa Tacul** **✨**or ~~Playa Muñoz~~  
*chose over Playa Muñoz because was a colder, windier day, though Play Muñoz might have been more sheltered from the wind. Usually not very into these popular, flat hikes, but this was pretty cool. You get to see some arrayanes, more than a few nice places to swim (I got in a couple of times despite the wind, particularly at Mirador Lago Moreno, where the rocky entry point was just too enticing, and the playa to the east of Playa Villa Tracul, because it was sheltered from the wind and hotter), plus the dope view from Cerro Llao Llao of Cerro López. Recommend.*

**Day 4** – ~~Bahía López &gt; Pico Turista &gt; Cerro Bailey Willis &gt; Refugio Laguna Negra~~ **Sendero Laguna Negra from Colonia Suiza to Refugio Laguna Negra**, with a side trip after dropping off stuff to **Cerro Bailey Willis ✨**  
*after seeing an imposing Cerro López the day before on my hike and consulting with my airbnb host, who has lived in the area for over 20 years, I changed my initial plans. Apparently, and as I later found out, the* *Bahía López to Cerro López via Sendero Palotinos* *is pretty heavy, and I would not recommend with a large backpack! Most people doing this back around the way route to Laguna Negra go up Camino al Refugio López, maybe spend a night there or camping nearby first, and then go through Pico Turista and Cerro Bailey Willis on way to spending a night at Refugio Laguna Negra, so I might suggest that (adds a night/day), though the rocky ridge atop Cerro Bailey Willis was not super chill either. Therefore, unless you're experienced I again would not suggest doing with a heavy backpack. The direct trail to Laguna Negra from Colonia Suiza was also LOVELY, btw, so I am glad I did it in the end. The extra 3 hours out-and-back to Cerro Bailey Willis sans backpack was also grrreat. Alone on the peak I had an up close encounter with my first juvenile condor...a highlight. The refugio is one of the older ones and smaller, but the food was good and I liked the intimate atmosphere.*

**Day 5** – ~~go back ""short way"" via Camino al Refugio López. More grocery shopping +/or swimming~~ headed down again via **Sendero Laguna Negra**  
*add a day for booking transport to Pampa Linda and running some errands to spend less money over there. Maybe could also do Playa Muñoz or Playa del Moreno sin viento/Playa del viento if you get that shit done in the morning of the extra day (or even add a second day to chill at one of those beaches).*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days\~\~\~\~\~

**Day 6** – **Pampa Linda** in morning, then **\[Saltillo Las Nalcas✨\], Ventisquero Negro, Mirador de la Garganta del Diablo**, ~~and maybe Mirador Este Glaciar Castaño Overa +/or Cerro Volcánico Este if have time~~  
*walked to Saltillo Las Nalcas from the albergue, then hitchhiked to Ventisquero Negro (the way there is a road for vehicles anyway, not really a trail, and hot and sunny and infested with tábanos), walked to Garganta del Diablo (again, road, but at least more shaded), and hitchhiked back to the albergue. My fave was Saltillo Las Nalcas, where I got in under the fall and then also later that evening went swimming in the glacial creeks with a great view of Cerro Tronador in the background. Ventisquero Negro and Garganta del Diablo were more touristy/groomed, though I guess worth it, kind of why not, if you're in the area. I do wish I had another day or two so I could do the* [*Mirador Este Glaciar Castaño Overa*](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/argentina/rio-negro/miradores-glaciar-castano-overo-y-ventisquero-negro?u=i&amp;sh=scsmqc) *and* [*Cerro Volcánico Este*](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/argentina/rio-negro/cerro-volcanico-este?u=i&amp;sh=scsmqc)*, and I also really liked the albergue, so worth staying in a couple more days to do that if you can.*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days\~\~\~\~\~

**Day 7** – **Refugio Otto Meiling + \[Sendero Glaciar Castaño Overa✨\]**  
*did as an out-and-back day hike. At the time, the nearly 18miles and not sure how much elevation gain was a lot for me, though later on in the trip I hiked 24mi, so w/e idk. The short add-on to the lower mirador was worth it, really beautiful (light for photos is better early in the day FYI, but I went on the way back in the afternoon and it was still stunning, just backlit), and there are some views at the top that are dope, plus saw lots of condors up there, but the trail itself most of the way is made more for horses, wide, dusty, flat, uninteresting and duh full of tábanos. I'm glad I did it, but I don't really know if it's necessary to go all the way to the refugio unless you're staying there. I grabbed lunch and rested for a bit, so that was chill, but it's not, like, the best hike I've done in my life. Maybe just go to the point where you can see the waterfalls coming off the glacier and the huge valley up top? Bring lunch? Up in the air in terms of recommending it or not. Not sure I would even recommend splitting it up into two days and spending the night at the refugio (though the entire staff was made up of women, which is v cool). Jury's out. (Also, FYI, met some people at the hostel in Pampa Linda who walked over the glacier, doing a Pampa Linda &gt; Ilón &gt; Rocca &gt; Meiling &gt; Pampa Linda loop, and they said I was smart to skip this option, but if it's something that appeals, go for it)*

**Day 8** – **Refugio Ilón from Pampa Linda + \[Cerro Capitan✨\]**  
*first day of 3 day point to point hike to Lago Frías. Trail to the refugio is kind of par for the course for the area, though it did seem like there were slightly fewer horseflies, and it was less groomed than other paths (always a bonus in my books). Refugio itself was really nice – liked the buildings and the lake that it's on. I went in the water a little too late in the day for it to be warm but can definitely see dipping in around midday being appealing. Dropped my stuff in the hut after checking in and high-tailed it up to Cerro Capitán. I was only interested in this at first because I was upset (due to financial limitations/my desire to not hire a guide and instead do everything myself that I could) that I wasn't going to get to do La Travesía de las 5 Lagunas. Someone who reviewed that hike had mentioned Laguna Jujuy being their favourite lake on the hike, so I thought that if I couldn't do the whole thing at least I could check out Jujuy from Ilón. Really glad I did! Instead of abajando-ing down to the lake and subiendo-ing back up, I just hung out on/explored the top. There's a great view of Tronador as well as Volcán Osorno all the way in Chile (if you're there on a clear day like I was), plus what you look at from Mirador del Doctor, and more from up there. But the way up/down is nothing to sneeze at either. Beautiful alpine flowers next to flowing streams, lots of different birds including bandurrias/black-faced ibis, which have a pretty wild birdcall, not to mention the fact I was entirely alone. So good.*

**Day 9 – Refugio Ilón to Refugio Rocca, including Mirador Del Doctor**  
*this was described as rough in lots of reviews/guides, and they were accurate. In that, with my full backpack, I was definitely tired and sore by the end. Only 11mi and 3000ft elevation gain, but all the up-and-down and terrain had me reeling. Was occasionally difficult to find the trail, even with markings from the park service, though I guess I prefer that to wide open paths. The mirador was nice, but you likely will not be alone, and I was more blown away by Cerro Capitán the afternoon before, though I would not skip the mirador if you're already all the way out there doing this trail – it's not too long/tough of an addition (I left my pack at the fork). Saw a Magellanic woodpecker and some other cool birdies in there,  met some cool people along the way, and there were a few spots to blast my exhausted footsies with cold mountain water, but was v happy to arrive at Rocca. Which is more built-out and busier and expensive than the other refugios I stayed at. If you're just gonna stay at one refugio this would not be my personal choice, but it did have creature comforts like showers so if that's your jam, go for it. Also absolutely necessary resting point on this 3 day trek.*

**Day 10 – Refugio Rocca to Lago Frías (part of Paso de las Nubes), Turisur ferry from Lago Frías to Puerto Pañuelo**  
*looking at the elevations, I thought this hike was gonna be easy peasy: mostly downhill, then a long flat section. DON'T BE ME! Leave as close to 8 or 8:30 as you can, because it's more time-intensive than it seems. Then it will be fun instead of stressful (will I make the boat? Won't I?), as there's more clambering than in other areas, different vegetation, different bugs, and lots of lovely streams to dip your toes in/some waterfalls. Booked the ferry in advance at the Turisur office in Bariloche, which I think is easiest – their website confused the shit out of me. After arriving back in Bariloche, I picked up a rental car I got for 4 days to do La Ruta de Los 7 Lagos and checked into my airbnb.*

**Day 11 – Drive to Villa La Angostura, boat from Bahía Brava to ""Puerto Arrayanes,"" tour around the bosque, walk back to Bahía Brava via Sendero Bosque de Arrayanes, including Miradores Bahía Mansa and Brazo Norte** ~~(on the way to Los Arrayanes National Park or after: Sendero Río Bonito, Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana, other beaches)~~  
*so prior to this point you can see that I've made recommendations for adjustments of 1-2 days, but this is where my time estimates really started to fail me. There is so, so much to see and do along the ruta, 4 days is really not enough if you're pretty sure you're NOT going to be making your way back to Patagonia any time soon. While I absolutely knew I would not be able to see everything of interest on this drive, and many spots on my list were definitely more suggestions/possibilities than hard plans/have-to-dos, I missed out on more than I would have liked to*. *For instance, just driving to Villa La Angostura, I saw tons of unmarked places with cars parked along the side of the road, where I would have stopped to investigate :p and swim if I'd left more time. Also the car rental company did not allow me to take my car to Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana because ""they're in Chile,"" despite the fact that the falls are actually not technically across the border in Chile, just past a border checkpoint. Such a bummer. But maybe if I'd had more time I could have found other adventurers, possibly Argentinos, or some kind of tour situation (eyeroll) with the ability to take transpo over there. So I would say something like:*  
\~\~\~1st day: drive leisurely to Villa La Angostura and check out swim spots along the way. If you have time in the afternoon (you should!) I'd do Sendero Río Bonito and chill on the beach it lets out onto (Playa La Escondida/Playa Río Bonito/Playa Publica) slash the other beaches nearby (Playa de las Aguas Calientes, Puerto Manzano)  
\~\~\~2nd day: Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana, and Playas on the way back (Playa La Aguada del Burro, Playa Escondida, Playa Lago Espejo)  
\~\~\~3rd day: Bosque de Arrayanes in the morning. Chill at Playa Lago Correntoso in the afternoon  
\~\~\~\~\~+2 days\~\~\~\~\~  
*As far as what I did get up to on my Day 11, I took the 3:45 ferry from Bahía Brava to the bosque. The schedule for boats from Bahía Brava (which take you along the outside of the peninsula) was slightly different than what I saw online (I thought the afternoon boat left at 3:15), but you should be able to find something to your liking from them or Bahía Mansa, and just swim at the beach while waiting. Also swam at the muelle/beach where the boat arrived, even though there are signs saying you're kinda not supposed to. But the sun was going down and I had to take my chances :). Tour was fine. Might have enjoyed the walk back along the peninsula more if I wasn't chasing the sunlight/sunset. Would say the first quarter leaving from the forest, where you can see more arrayanes outside of the boardwalked route, and the last quarter, where you can see more of the water, are the best. But the middle section is kind of basic, dusty, and flat, and I was a bit bored/tired. Head to Mirador Brazo Norte for the sunset (if you're there around that time), and Mirador Bahia Mansa any other time (pretty view of the water and boats, reminded me of Croatia)*

**Day 12 –** ~~Cascadas Dora y Santa Ana,~~ **✨Playa La Escondida/the beach by Río Bonito, Playa Lago Correntoso, \[Playa la Aguada del Burro\], Playita de Lago Espejo Chico,** ~~Sendero Cascada Ñivinco, Cascada Vuliñanco~~, **and creeks on the side of the road** on the way from **Villa La Angostura &gt; San Martín de Los Andes**  
*There was lots I enjoyed here, and I had a a decent amount of time at all of the stops listed, but it might be worth it to break it up further (following something like the suggested itinerary above, where you'd have visited Río Bonito, Playa la Aguada del Burro, Playa Lago Espejo, and Playa Lago Correntoso by this point already) so you could add (Lago Espejo Chico proper? didn't make it to the lake proper so can't say anything about it) Sendero Cascada Ñivinco at a reasonable hour (before 4 is much better – heat of the sun was gone when I got there on Day 13), and Cascada Vuliñanco (which I only ever saw from the road, didn't do the hike to it) today. As far as what I did do, LOVED Playa Río Bonito (cut out the walk to it because of all I wanted to try to squeeze in the day, but looked really cool and liked the small part of it closer to the beach I did, walking variably in the cool water and on the trail), Playa Lago Correntoso (water is so, so clear. Parking was a bit of a bitch but once I found it I stayed for hours because I was just in love. Plus there are places to jump/dive/drift at Río Correntoso), and Playita de Lago Espejo Chico (more like a creek situation. Flowing water to float down, and a tree to jump off of. Fun times). Playa la Aguada del Burro was less busy, which is always a plus, but given what I got used to on this day, was less impressive (water's murkier, etc.), and could definitely skip. There's also a beautiful river on the side of 40 (Río Pichi Traful?) I hopped into at some random place along the road and loved.*

**Day 13 – \[Playa de Yuco✨\],** ~~La Islita, Muelle Hua Hum, Pucará, Playa Quila Quina, and/or Pya Catritre on Lago Lácar,~~ **Playa Lago Hermoso,** ~~Cascadas del Rio Hermoso,~~ **dip in Lago Faulkner,** ~~Lago Escondido,~~ **\[Sendero Cascada Ñivinco✨\],** ~~y Playa de Lago Traful~~ on the way from **San Martín de los Andes &gt; Villa Traful**  
*As you can see, there was a bunch I missed out on closer to San Martín de los Andes (including a river area called Pozones de Caleufú about an hour from the town I didn't even bother trying to wedge into what I could see was becoming an uncomfortably tight schedule), which is also, from what I heard from most of the Argentinians I met, THE town preferred over Bariloche for hanging out in the north of Patagonia. I barely got to spend any time at all in town. So I would do something like*  
\~\~\~1st full day SMdlA: Pozones de Caleufú in morning/midday, hike La Islita in the later afternoon and stay for sunset  
\~\~\~2nd full day SMdlA: Playa de Yuco, then quick stop at Muelle Hua Hum on the way to Pucará  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-3 days (3rd day for errands, and/or other beaches)\~\~\~\~\~  
*in which case, on this, the day you leave SMdlA you could do Playa Quila Quina +/or Pya Catritre on the way out of town instead of drive all the way to Playa de Yuco and all the way back like I did, leaving more time for other stuff throughout the day. That being said, Playa de Yuco is a recommend. There are like 5 lil different beach areas to chill at. The more ""rugged"" Playas 4 and 5 had fewer people, but there were great swimming and jumping/diving spots all around. Playa Lago Hermoso seemed nice, but there was a strong wind coming from the west by the time I got there, so it was harder to enjoy. I stubbornly camped out there nonetheless, only to regret it later when getting to the Cascadas Ñivinco with no direct sun or when rolling into Villa Traful past sundown with nowhere to stay. If your day is similar go elsewhere – perhaps, for instance, the Cascadas del Rio Hermoso would have been a bit more protected from the wind by trees? The beach at Lago Faulkner is sandy but is right by route 40 (aka not as nice) and was still chilly despite facing east, so I just hopped in for a quick dip. Could easily skip to get to Cascadas Ñivinco sooner to spend more time there. It was still busy when I get there around 4, even though most of the foot traffic was heading out back to their cars, so hard to say if it would be pleasant during peak hours, but in my imagination it would be magnificent in full sun (since I still enjoyed it, even in the shade), and I would give it a shot for sure.*

**Day 14 –** ~~Valle Encantado on way from~~ **Villa Traful &gt; Bariloche** via 65/237, ✨**Cerro López (Bahía López route)** in the afternoon  
*First things first, I would add a full day in Villa Traful, obvio (and perhaps try to get to Villa Traful before sunset :D). Then you can maybe check out el bosque sumergido, the main town, and the alfajores at Del Montañés. I had initially planned on doing these things today, but got it into my harebrain I had to try to do the tough route up to Pico Turista before leaving Bariloche. Having already booked my bus out (dumbass) to El Bolsón for Day 15, and having no other feasible time in which I could attempt it given my overscheduling the rest of the trip, I tried to high-tail it back to Bariloche early in the morning on Day 14 to start up to Cerro López at a ""reasonable"" hour. I therefore also missed the hike (slash swimming?) at Valle Encantado. Actually, the best way to fix all this would be to add a full day for Cerro López earlier on, in which case you could perhaps do these things in and around Villa Traful ""today"" (aka the day you wake up in and leave Villa Traful), still possibly getting the car back to Bariloche at the end of the day, or driving back to Bariloche and doing Valle Encantado the next morning.*  
\~\~\~\~\~+1-2 days (1 for Cerro López earlier in the trip, and possibly a full day in Villa Traful)\~\~\~\~\~  
*As it was I made it to the trailhead at Bahía López around 12:30, which was too late really (for me, not for all people) to start, but I forced it. Because I was doing this more dangerous, unfrequented route alone (not advisable), I was going quite slow and cautiously. By the time I made it to the ridgeline/turnoff between Sendero Palotinos/Pico Turista and the below ridge ""route"" (used loosely), at the rate I was going (quite slow, like 1mph on the harder upward incline sections), I knew if I tried to go to Pico Turista via the ridge I wouldn't be able to get my car back to the rental place by 8pm, and maybe wouldn't even make it to a safer portion of the hike before sundown. So I cut across the N/E face of the mountain :(((. This isn't used that much either, apparently, so there were some dicey waterfall/snow crossings and lots of areas where the trail was not clear at all. I had my offline AllTrails map but that did not mean that the GPS route coincided with anything in reality. I still recommend this if you have experience bouldering/climbing/hiking for real for real, just go earlier so you can go at a safe pace and do the ridgeline to Pico Turista well before sunset (and, you know, go with an equally experienced friend). If you don't have experience with hardcore hikes, don't know how to step/aren't sure in your steps, DO NOT ATTEMPT. But I saw many condors, beautiful views, and had a fun time figuring out my way up the mountain.*

\~\~\~\~\~+1 day in Bariloche for a mani/pedi, souvenir shopping, laundry, etc.?\~\~\~\~\~

**BARILOCHE AREA SUMMARY**  
Did lots of amazing shit in 14 days, but I would recommend adding anywhere from 6-12, maybe even more days both to make it a bit more leisurely AND to get more sights/experiences in. Many of these added days would be during la Ruta de los 7 Lagos, which would mean a car for more days than I could afford (there were definitely people doing this by bus/hitchhiking, but I didn't research this so cannot advise), but if you budget better for that ahead of time and/or find friends/just have fam round to split that expense with you, it could work out.

See you next time in El Bolsón, El Chaltén, and El Calafate! (It took me a long time to write Part 1 so it might take a min for Part 2, but I'll get there!)",91,18,23528,4281,1

"My experience going to Morocco as a first-time traveler: the good, the bad and the ugly. ","Hi y'all!

I just came back from my first international trip and I wanted to share my experience with you guys so it can give you some insight on what to expect if you ever decide to go to Morocco for the first time.

I visited Portugal and Spain, and I wanted to go to Morocco as well due to its proximity, but since I had read some bad experiences other travelers had, I hired a tour instead of going by myself.

It was a 5-day tour that started in Algeciras, Spain and included the visit of Tangiers, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh and Fez.

**THE GOOD**

I think the best part of this tour was that you don't really spend that much money. Everything's included: transportation, accommodation, breakfasts and dinners as well as some attractrions. We stayed at nice hotels and the food was great, even though they didn't have a lot of Moroccan dishes available. It was more like international/standard food. The only money you spend is on souvenirs, lunch, snacks and additional attractions that were not included on the tour; for example the dinner show at Chez Ali (which I didn't pay for btw).

Another good thing about it was that I got to ride the ferry that goes from Algeciras to the port of Tanger Med. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and seeing two different countries and two continents so close to each other was probably the coolest thing I've ever done. It was like a dream come true.

In general, local Moroccan people were so humble and welcoming with us. They were curious to know where we were from and we always felt safe (except in one part at the end of the trip, which I'll tell later on).

**THE BAD**

Like I said in the beginning. I decided to hire a tour because I had read lots of stories involving scams and tourist traps in Morocco, but it turns out that I felt scammed the most by our guide!! When we were visiting Tangiers and Rabat he told us not to buy anything we saw on the stores because, according to him, the stuff they were selling was of ""bad quality"" and that he knew a place in Marrakesh where we could buy quality souvenirs at a very good price. I imagined that *that* place was going to be in the Medina or something, but it was actually a fucking boutique that sold really expensive stuff. Then he took us to an argan oil shop where the employees were expecting us with a sales pitch ready to sell us overpriced shit. Later we found out that the shop next door sold the same products at a much lower price. When the guide saw that most people were going to the shop next door he got mad and kicked us out of there!  He was also hostile to the street vendors who tried to sell us stuff in Marrakesh, even if they weren't being pushy at all.  He claimed that he was ""protecting"" us, but I saw him argue with them a couple of times. Some people in our tour claimed that they saw him spit on one of them, but I never saw that myself. He also made a couple of inappropiate comments here and there throughout the tour.

Another instance in which I felt I was going to be taken advantage of was when I asked the hotel's receptionist if there was a bus or some sort of public transportation that could take me from the hotel to the Medina. He said there wasn't any, and he immediately referred me to the taxis parked outside the hotel which would charge me 10 euros for the ride. Not happy with this, I researched on Google Maps and found that there was in fact a bus line that could drop me off just outside the Koutoubia Mosque. Two friendly locals on the street confirmed it, and for only 4 dirhams I was in the heart of the Medina. Rode the bus with the locals and never felt unsafe.

Another thing that sucked about the tour is that it was too short and rushed. Let's be honest: 5 days is not enough no see and explore everything a country has to offer. The guide was always in a hurry because we had to leave for the next destination. The second day we did 3 cities: left Tangiers in the morning after a short stop in Cape Spartel, spent the afternoon in Rabat and arrived to Casablanca in the evening. It was fucking exhausting. We only had one full day off in Marrakesh and I used it to go to the Souk and the medina, and still there was just soo much that we didn't get to see.

**THE UGLY**

As I mentioned a couple of lines above, the only time when we felt kind of ""unsafe"" and overwhelmed was the last day of the tour when we visited the Medina in Fez.

As soon as we stepped out of the bus we were swarmed with sellers who followed us all the time. As usual, the guide only took us to shops HE wanted us to buy stuff from, and when the sales pitch finished, he would take us to the next one and so on. The sellers were patiently waiting for us, and as soon as we stepped out of the stores, the hustle would continue. Another thing that didn't help was the fact that we visited the medina during a Muslim holiday (I believe it was prophet Muhammad's birthday) so the alleyways were PACKED with people, It really was like stepping into another time and place. Probably the only time when I felt that ""culture shock"" in Morocco, not even Marrakesh was that bad.  The tour of the medina finished and the sellers followed us all the way back to our bus. They mainly targeted the women in our group. As a man, I was approached by them like a couple of times, but simply saying ""la, shukran"" or ignoring them was enough for them to leave you alone, but man, they went hard on the ladies. I remember one started BEGGING. He said: ""please madam, this is for my children. I have to feed my wife and my children!"".  Three policemen were standing outside our bus but they did nothing to stop them. I think they were just there in case things escalated, which they never did.

I'm not an expert, but from my experience, I can advise you this:

* Don't be like me and don't spend just 5 days in 5 cities. Either spend more time in the country (like at least 2 days per city) or just focus in one specific region at a time. I would stay up north.
* If you end up going on a tour group make sure to read reviews of the company and the guides. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose ours, he was assigned to us by the tour operator. It was an old bald guy named Muhammad, who goes by the nickname of ""Toyota"". If you hear of him, RUN!
* Take your time to see things at your own pace. Buy your souvenirs wherever you feel you're getting a good deal. Don't feel pressured by the sellers of the guides. It's your money and your time.
* Always look for stores that have the prices displayed on the items. If they don't have them, that means you'll have to ask and most likely haggle too.
* If you go to the Fez medina either go with a local or a reputable guide. It's like a maze in there. You'll definitely get lost and you won't easily find your way out. You'll be a easy target of scammers and fake guides if you go by yourself.

Anyway, to conclude this very long post (sorry!) I'd like to add that I would LOVE to return to Morocco. Rabat and Tangiers looked pretty cool and chill. I'd also like to check out Tetouan and Chefchaouen, since they were not part of this tour.

Did anyone else have similar experiences when you went to Morocco? Any other recommendations for me if I go for a second time?

I would love to read them :)

Croatia Road Trip 2024,"This summer I went on a trip to Croatia with my family. We rented a car and went from Zagreb all the way to Dubrovnik. Here’s a summary.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn’t know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There’s a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn’t get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

Bought Land locked house ,"Hello, I bought a house 2 years ago back in 2022. It’s a land locked house with no ingress or egress due to a section of state land at the beginning of the private rd with no easement in place. I signed stuff when I closed that said I was aware of the issue. The title company stamped it and sent it to my lender and they just saw the stamp and assumed the issue had been resolved.. I got a call a couple weeks after closing and he said Fannie Mae wasn’t going to accept it due to no ingress or egress. Now I’m trying to put my house on the market and can’t get any bank to finance it. Has anyone ever heard of something like this? Can I take legal action?

Can I sue for damages?,"My Buyers Agent says we should…

BLUF: We purchased a home in Alabama and moved there from Colorado just to find out 30 minutes from closing there was a problem which led to my approved lending being revoked.

In Alabama they have a thing called Right of Redemption. The home wasn’t listed with this information. The Seller and Selling Agent is an independent cash investor who purchased the home at auction, made some improvements, flipped, and then listed. The title company discovered this a few days before closing. Since the investor was cash they are allowed to assume the risk and never attained a bond which left us requiring a new bond for my lender. The seller actually agreed to pay for the bond at 1% of the property value. This had to be approved by the lender but was rejected on the grounds that it did not cover the totality of the liability which they believed was greater since the right of redemption is not for an individual, but from their estate since the previous owner had passed away. This meant I was suddenly on the hook to cover the larger liability in cash, which was out of my reach.

I’ve incurred several thousands invested into this transaction in various fees, packing/moving, and an Air-B&amp;B for several weeks due to the delay. I was hemorrhaging cash daily and needed somewhere to house the family fast, ended up in a rental with a year lease. And on top of all this I’ve still got a mortgage back in Colorado… We packed up our whole lives with the understanding that this was imminent. If the bond and right f redemption information was disclosed from the jump none of this would have happened.

ROFR Questions for Land,"My wife and I have been in the process of buying a parcel of land to build a new home. 
We submitted an offer in May and it was accepted after some negotiation. 
We started the inspection process getting soil samples, test holes for buildability, starting the septic permit process etc. 
Then in mid July ( about 3 weeks to close) we were notified that the land had a right of first refusal on the deed for some family members and the last remaining relative was still alive and interested. He was notified at that time by the selling agent and stated he was interested in the property. 
It has been 60 days now and he just last week submitted a formal offer.

We don’t want to lose this land, but we have also paid roughly $4k on the process for building on this lot and don’t want to lose that money.  We would not have spent that money if we had known up front about this issue and moved on to looking for other land. 

A few questions that hopefully someone can answer: 
1. Are the sellers forced to sell to this ROFR holder no matter the conditions?
2. Are we basically out of this money? What options could we have?
3. Who would ultimately have been responsible for notifying everyone of this deed defect?",23,4,1211,224,0
Buying an EIFS ‘synthetic stucco’ home,"Hey All, new here. I’m under contract to buy a 1991 wood framed home with EIFS synthetic stucco, Atlanta region.

The EIFS is also below grade and does not have the minimum 6” ground clearance.

How concerned should I be. Initial estimates are $20k to remediate and the Seller is offering to help remediate but my concern is there will be hidden damages (wood frame and insulation rot) and the seller wasn’t very forthcoming on the disclosure statement around some other obvious issues with the home (found out water damage claims were made recently when searching for insurance and the seller never disclosed)

"Ex gifted part of the downpayment but is not on mortgage or deed, should they get their money back?","My ex and I purchased a home in MA two years ago. Since we were not married, the purchase was based on my income alone, but we both equally contributed to the downpayment. A family member of theirs ""gifted"" their portion of the downpayment, and then they were going to be paying this family member back over time. It was an official gift letter from this family member, to me, for the purchase of this home. The mortgage is in my name, the deed is in my name, the roof loan for the new roof is in my name. My ex paid about 35% of the monthly mortgage payment, paid utilities, and put in 15% of the roof cost.

My ex recently decided to end our relationship of 6 years. There was emotionally cheating involved. I had originally planned to at least give them their portion of the downpayment that they, or technically the family member, contributed, and then give them back what they contributed to the new roof. I don't have this kind of money on hand, though, so I was going to figure out maybe borrowing it from a family member or if I do sell the house, using the equity to pay them back.

Less than two weeks after our break up, however, I found out my ex is now with the person I was told not worry about and I'm feeling super bitter and betrayed. More lies have come to the surface because of this and I am just disgusted. It feels insane to me now to give them back this large chunk of money after all the lies, betrayal and just plain disrespect. It's like allowing them to ""have their cake, and eat it too"", if that makes sense.

We have a few agents interested in representing us in selling our portfolio. With the NAR verdict it seems we have more options than before. It always seemed strange for a seller to pay the buyers agents commission. So, we think the following are the options.

-Hire a business selling broker for a 5% commission to sell the portfolio (they negotiate commission split with buyer’s agent if there is one)

-Hire a local agent that is part of a national real estate broker. They charge a 4% commission and post to the MLS explicitly stating they will offer the buyer’s agent a split on that 4% where a buyer’s agent will get 2%.

-Sell the portfolio ourselves and offer ANY agent that brings a buyer 4%. For-Sale-By-Owner is preferred but we can’t list on MLS, though because we are only selling as a package, maybe this doesn’t matter?

Urgent: Bulgarian airlines Lost Luggage Tag,"Hey!

I went on a work related trip to Sofia (Bulgaria) and I flew home to Lisbon (Portugal) two days ago. After arriving in Lisbon, I wasn’t able to find my bag and realized it had been lost.

Since I had a connection flight by Iberia airlines in Madrid (Spain) and the luggage check-in was done in Sofia by Bulgaria airlines directly to Lisbon, I’m assuming they forgot to put my luggage in the plane and it is still somewhere in the Madrid Airport.


As soon as I noticed my luggage was lost, I tried going to the lost luggage, as well as contacting Iberia via phone to which both told me they were unable to file a claim since I don’t have the luggage tag (yes, unfortunately I think I dropped it in the plane, lesson learned).


Iberia recommended me to reach out to Bulgaria airlines asking for the tag number, so I can file a claim with them, and I tried, but, without success.
It appears their phone lines are flooded and they haven’t answered my email, neither provided any sort of automatic reply with a case number.


So I’m lost and I have no idea what to do, as it seems no one is looking for my luggage and I’m afraid it will eventually get lost forever!!


Can someone share tips on what you have done in similar situations? Or how can I get in touch with Bulgarian Airlines quickly?
Anything that might help. Thanks!

"Discerning possible options for Two Families living on the same property, wondering if we've missed any possibilities?

8. Buy a 4 or 5 bedroom house and build an Accessory Dwelling Unit for our family.
9. Buy two homes near each other and call it good enough.

The advantages of a single shared building (options 1-7) are multiple:

* We live in Minnesota, so the heating costs would be less with a shared roof.
* We only really need 1 ""family room"" with a tv, so having a single offering for both families would be excellent.
* We only really need 1 large dining room.
* Shared access to a guest bedroom.
* More distinct rooms for living/playing/reading/being/etc. than if we had separate houses.

My favorite of the above options is #6/7, since we could come up with a design that divides up the rooms in a way that makes sense for the sizes/needs of our two families, and also easily put in doors between the units in logical spots. It would also have decent future proofing, as the other unit could be rented out if one family decided to move long in the future.

Tl;dr: What options can you think of for two families to live together? Which one(s) are liable to be the most affordable?",186,29,2175,390,0

Advice on Negotiating Post Inspection/ Realtor Issues,"Hello! First time home buyer looking for some advice on negotiations after inspection and dealing with realtor:

My husband and I just had an offer accepted on a home that we toured virtually (we temporarily live across the country). When we toured the house we loved it but thought it was a little too big and more than we wanted to spend. Last week there was a significant price drop on the house (\~13%) so we decided to go for it and made an initial offer at asking, then increased it \~3% over the new asking price after our realtor told us another offer would be coming in that day that we would be competing with. Before making the inital offer we had asked our realtor if she could find out why the price had dropped so significantly especially since the house had only been on the market for a few weeks and she said she would reach out to the sellers agent but she thinks ""its just a motivated seller knowing that the market is changing"" and never said anything else on that.

The offer was put in and accepted on Saturday which was the day after the price drop. This is a hot market and we had company in town for the weekend so we did not think we would have a chance if we waited to see the house in person. We flew out for the inspection on Monday. When we arrived at the house we immediately noticed issues with the exterior that our realtor had not shown us during the tour and that were not visible from photos (think no gutters, rotting siding that needs to be replaced and paint needing to be scraped and re-done). We are still waiting for the final inspection report but we estimate that the cost to repair just that would somewhere between around $150k which is \~11% of the accepted price of the house. Our realtor did not give us ANY indication that this was the state of the exterior.

We now realize that this was probably part of the reason that the sellers lowered the price and since the issues would be obvious to anyone with two eyes who walked the property, we aren't sure what leverage we will have to negotiate post inspection. We are also slightly mortified to be negotiating on this since we imagine that the sellers assume our offer was based on us seeing the exterior. Other than the exterior there were a few issues as you would expect but nothing crazy.

We are mostly frustrated with our realtor as we have been working with her for few months now and were already having some issues/frustration with her leading up to this (attention to detail, mistakes in paperwork, not getting us information we requested, difficulty communicating, glossing over major issues, pushing her own vendors on us). At one point during a prior offer on a different house the seller's counter included changing the deed to a quit claim deed which she passed along to us without telling us what it was and then when we noticed she told us ""we should never sign a quit claim deed"" but then told us it was fine and we should just sign it.  We also had to back out of an accepted offer over the summer because of bad guidance we received from her. We have been very clear that we are fist time buyers and have no idea what we are doing so assume we know nothing.

At this point we have no trust in the relationship and if we are not able to get this deal to work out we have decided we will not continue to work with her. We are also worried that if we back out we could be ""blackballed"" in the market because we will have backed out of accepted offers twice.

Additional background- We are moving for my husband's job and she was the realtor who his employer connected us with as part of the relocation package. She is local and has been in the business for 20+ years so we unfortunately assumed she was vetted and would be good to work with.

We would really like to make this house work out so would love any advice on ideas for negotiating with the sellers and what might be reasonable to ask for? I know this is probably not a popular idea but would it be reasonable to ask her to take a cut on commissions to make this go through? Also interested to hear any advice about how to approach the situation with our realtor.

Thank you and my apologies for turning this in to a bit of a rant!",53,7,4208,782,0

Am I overthinking this or should I get a real estate license?,"So first off, I want to say I have no desire to be a real estate agent or even in the business. I have my own business and a completely different field, and I have more than my hands full with that. Now here’s the thing I was in a relationship with a real estate agent For several years and was able to easily look at houses when I wanted and was never rushed. I’ve bought and sold several homes throughout my life and having a girlfriend in the business, definitely helped. Well we are not together anymore and that proposes some unique challenges. I have a great agent to work with and he is a close friend of mine so I’m not worried about his integrity, but as I am self-aware enough to know, I take my time with major decisions and purchases. My ex and I had probably looked at over 50 houses before I bought the last one. I’m not gonna expect an agent to take me to 50 houses. I get it. But I’m wondering if a solution would be to take the Real Estate test until I pass and then be able to go look at whatever houses I want on my own. Is that how it even works? I Don’t wanna do any deals and understand that I don’t know the business. I know this sounds a little extreme and I would be using my friend to do the deals but if I can take two weeks of my life this winter and dedicate it to getting that license, I feel as if it could make my searching process a lot easier.

NC- under contract but roof has significant hail damage and is old,"We’re under contract for a 330k house in NC, put down a 5k due diligence fee. Home inspection report came back to noting some roof issues and suggested a qualified roofing come to give an evaluation. Roofer comes out and says there is excessive granular loss in the shingles, cracks, missing pieces, evidence of repair patches, and quite a bit of hail damage. Says the sellers should try to file for a claim with their home insurance due to presence of significant hail damage for a new roof.

We are going into negotiations next and will be planning to ask for concessions. Roofer told me it’ll be difficult for us to get home insurance, or have insurance drop us pretty quickly with the state of the roof. Also same thing with the lender- due to the roof state. Selling agent says sellers are going through a divorce, don’t want to do repairs, and they have a backup offer. I’m thinking unless the back up offer is all cash, this would be a similar problem moving forward. Sellers did not disclose age of roof (says they don’t know) or any repairs done in the sale disclosure. But did mention to us that she had a roofer go up there quite recently (in the last couple years) to repair some things and said the roof was in good condition. 

I’m just wondering what’s the best approach to this? Obviously we want to be reasonable, but also don’t want to be stupid. Will the sellers have to disclose these issues if we decide to walk away? ",66,12,1439,263,0
Wine in Europe - summarize some differences for me!,"We all know about how some countries are “known for their wine”. Italian wine, French wine, Greek wine, Portuguese wine to name some of the big ones I’ve heard of.

Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) Exemptions,"Hi all,

I hope you're well.

I am due to travel with G Adventures from Mexico down to Costa Rica. Today they emailed us saying that Honduras now requires UK nationals to have a visa. However, I am wondering if I would be exempt because of the central america border control agreement (CA-4) between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.


I ask this because:

- I will have entered Honduras via land and via Guatemala, so presumably I will have a stamp in my passport from Guatemala that I could present at the Honduran border 
- For people who have travelled in this region before, is the CA-4 visa a physical paper or is it just the stamp that you get from entering the first country?

I have also emailed the various embassies and consulates but 1) it's Friday and 2) I'm flying out next week and not currently in the UK, so keen to get as much info as I can from as many sources 😅 

Many thanks in advance!!!

Unfortunately, there were 700 Euros differences in the price - I was refused to get any of it nor to get it back as a voucher!

Advice needed for negotiating with a buyers agent as the buyer in GA,"So here's the 'stich-  \



I found a house in the area I have been looking on my own that I want to make a cash offer on. I tried to call several Georgia real estate attorneys but they either never called me back or told me they only handle closings, so I begrudgingly reached out to a real estate agent and asked if they could write up the offer for a flat fee, to which they responded ""the seller pays the commission, you don't need to worry about that.""I know this is no longer the law of the land, but I didn't argue the point because frankly, I was tired and uncertain about what to negotiate.  \



The agent showed us the house without asking us to sign anything but other than showing us the house, the agent either hasn't gotten any information out of the seller's agent or isn't sharing it. We decided on our offer amount and the agent sends a copy of the buyer-broker agreement that says the buyer is responsible for the 3% commission, that the agreement is good through the end of 2024 and that the buyer consents to dual agency should the situation arise.  
\


I absolutely do not want to be responsible for paying the agent 3% for a house that I found, let alone agree to be locked in for the next 3 months, possibly under dual agency. It says the seller's responsibility at closing is $0, I don't see where the agent even attempts to get the seller to pay the 3% commission, unless I am missing something.

FL- seller admitted to lying on disclosure about home having aluminum wiring,"We got the disclosure for the house we were looking at and went under contract and moved ahead with the inspection. The inspection found aluminum wiring and the seller indicated “Don’t know” on the seller’s disclosure when it asked if the home had aluminum wiring. 

When our realtor brought it to her attention, the listing agent (the sellers mother) immediately replied in writing that she knew about the aluminum wiring from the time the seller purchased the home in 2016 but it was mitigated with alumicon. 

My question is about our recourse. The seller/listing agent (mother and daughter) have been stubborn throughout this entire process. We would like for them to extend the inspection period and pay for an electrician at their expense to confirm the wiring is successfully mitigated or to fix it. In the event that they refuse, we’d just like our inspection money back and to back out of the contract. 

If they refuse to fix the electrical issues or give us our inspection money back, do we have legal recourse to sue for damages since she admitted to lying on the disclosure? We put up $2,000 between the inspection and appraisal and took a day off of work to attend the inspection. Additionally, the agent acted unprofessionally during the inspection- she and her daughter, the seller, were both working from the home the whole time and their 4 large dogs were also there and unrestrained and jumping on us the entire 4 hours we were there. 

Just wondering if we have a case to sue should she try to be difficult about making the repairs or giving us our money back. Thanks! ",76,12,1589,277,0

SELLERS:  Stop wanting to price off the online guesstimate. ,"These guesstimates are based off an algorithm.  Unless you live in a newer cookie cutter subdivision where all the houses are basically the same, this algorithm has no idea what the house looks like.  It does not know the upgrades, the deferred maintenance issues, that there is a blacktop plant across the street, NONE OF IT.  It is grabbing beds, baths, price per square foot and throwing a guess on it. 

I have a client interested in an off market, but he wants to lowball because of the online guesstimates.  What he doesn't understand is that there is a 1978 manufactured home sale and a derelict cinder block house sale comp that are pushing that guess down.  We'll see how this goes.   
And I have a seller that wants to price way over my suggestion because of the online guess. 

This is what happens when you price the house too high. 

1. It gets no activity and no showings.  You will be encouraged by looking at the views because it is a new listing but no one schedules to see it because it is too high. 
2. Your Realtor can do all the open houses and marketing you want, but no one will schedule a a showing because it is overpriced. 
3. You do a few token reductions, 2% or so at time, no one is still looking because it is still overpriced. 
4. You finally realize this price was a mistake, you make a more significant reduction.  The price is finally at least touching reality but now buyers are questioning why it is still on the market.  They conjure up all sorts of scenarios and still will not see it. 
5. Then seller remorse sets in, the price is reduced to where the Realtor initially wanted it priced.  But now it is shop worn, and the only offers you are going to get are low balls. 

We preach about this in the sub all the time, please price your house correctly and sell it.  Do not be tempted to ""try a price"" or because it says on line it should be this or Aunt Dorris says the Realtor just wants to price it low for a quick sale, so go high.   

Listed too high:  No activity

Final walk through - day of closing,"Every house I have bought, the final walkthrough has always been on the day of closing. The realtors always seem to push for this. It's great and convenient when everything is 100% but I have always wondered, what if something is wrong? I have already wired the funds, everyone is waiting at the closing table, and It just seems like this would set everyone up for a huge waste of time and headache if something needs to be addressed. 

How do other realtors feel about this? Is it actually possible to resolve all issues the same day or is it always a phone call saying the closing isn't happening? Are realtors always taking a gamble and just hoping for the best? I feel like this also puts unfair pressure on the buyer to just accept as is should something go wrong as everyone is waiting and you have already probably taken time off etc.

I think there should be a pre walk through a day or two before, then a final. I understand though as sellers, the logistics is not always possible.",35,7,990,181,0
Is British Airways broke? ,"I’ve just come back from travelling. I flew from London to Beijing with BA, then country hopped with Korean Air and Japan Airlines. This just highlighted the state of the BA planes and service. On KA and JA we were provided with meals and earphones and the entertainment systems seemed more updated and these were short haul flights. Whenever I’ve flown short haul with BA all we’ve ever gotten was a bottle of water and a chocolate biscuit bar. 

My only other comparison for long haul was Emirates (over 5 years ago) so I thought it was just the standard these days but clearly other flag carriers are able to offer better.

Edit: I don’t know why I’m being downvoted, I spent  over £990 on the BA flights alone excluding seat selection so I have a right to question the overall flight experience. ",26,5,800,144,1

Looking for NYC historical tour recommendations ,"I'm traveling to NYC this month.

Where to invest inherited money?,"Background: I am a 24 yr old, and like the title suggests I recently inherited some money that was set aside in a custodial account. Now that I am an independent and over 18 I have sole ownership of the account. The balance is around $260,000. As you can imagine this is a large amount for someone at my age. Immediately I invested all of it in a couple of blue chip stocks and planned on forgetting about the account and live within my means of what I earn currently(about $30,000/yr). I was always taught to save as much as you can so why would this be any different?

My request for advice is I am looking into moving soon and, instead of renting, buy a house. Based on my current earnings and my personal savings account (about $30,000 in my personal acc.) I can afford a mortgage on a house worth about $130k(760 credit score). I know I can’t find a house worth living in for that much in this current housing market. Ideally I would like a house around the $200k mark to be able to fix up and flip. I am heavily considering a duplex and renting out half while I live in the other and remodeling both sides over time. My question is how much should I dig into my inherited account and while still being about to afford a mortgage? I could just buy a house will all cash but then I wont have much money in the stock market and have most of my assets in the housing market.

"Struggling financially, should I sell home or is renting even an option?","Hi everyone, first time poster. I’m a first time home owner with little financial knowledge who bought a home at 23 back in 2021 for $160,000 at a fixed rate of 3.5%, my payment with insurance is right at $1050. At the time I had a vehicle paid in full with not many other expenses and almost immediately had friends I was able move In to help with payments. I’ve been able to maintain roommates up until recently, current friends plan on moving out in the next 2 to 3 months and at our current age no longer have any immediate friends looking to share living spaces. Only a few months ago I felt good about taking on the house by myself, I don’t make the best money at only around $35,000 a year but have always been fairly frugal and okay at saving, but ran into some bad luck on a trip and my beloved vehicle died on me. I spent a good portion of my savings on getting home with all our things and no longer had the money to buy a vehicle outright and sadly needed to use it on a down payment. The vehicle has added nearly $700 to my monthly expenses and I definitely regret making the purchase and know how dumb it was to take on that extra debt. Since getting the car I haven’t been able to muster any meaningful savings and I’m pretty stressed about whether I’ll be able to handle everything alone now with the roommates leaving. I’m definitely trying to get out of the vehicle but not very confident in finding someone to pay off the loan and I’d still be left without work transportation. Zillow and realtor.com both have the house valued at about $230,00 and rent at $1600. I realize I probably won’t get either of those numbers out of it but given my options is it worth selling the house? I’d love to keep it of course and renting was always a hope, I live close to a university in a good location and figured in the right situation I could have steady tenants at close to the estimated amount, but not really sure of the feasibility I know there would be a awkward period of having to find a tenant and then a place for myself to still live.

Travel and tobacco question ,"Hi,

I have a question regarding a recent flight I got
From Hong Kong to Melbourne, Australia. 

I attempted to purchase 100 grams of tobacco from Hong Kong airport, well aware of the 25g limit when entering into Australia. 

When I went to purchase the tobacco, the cashier asked the question “do you know you are not allowed to take this amount of tobacco into Australia, this is over the legal limit”. 

I replied “yes”. 

She asked me the same questions three times, to which I replied yes and she sold them to me.

I boarded my flight to Melbourne and as we were about to take off, an air hostess said there was an issue with my boarding pass and took it from me. I never saw her again. Everyone else’s boarding passes around me were with them and not taken. 

As I landed in Australia, I went through customs and was not intervened by Australia boarder security. 

Can someone please tell me if there is any connection to the cashier being strange about the tobacco, and the air hostess taking my boarding pass from me with no explanation? 

Did the government register me in their systems?

Sincerely,

Highly anxious Male, 26, currently smoking their cigarettes. ",28,5,1171,203,1

Commission to share between agent ,"Hi

I’m a serious buyer and have free legal real estate service from my employer.

I am thinking about staying unrepresented and make an offer with a 12k of concession in a 400k home. I feel like the seller will be ok to pay the concession if they don’t have to pay for my agent.

It may not be the case on some situation like if the seller already agree to pay 5-6% of commission to share between agent. In that case I understand the seller agent will just keep it all. If it’s the case, I prefer to hire my own agent…

Is it ok to ask the seller agent how the commission work? Ask if the seller already agree by contract to pay 5-6% no matter what?

Need Advice on Turkish E-Visa Application with Short-term Schengen Visa,"Hello everyone! 

I'm facing an issue with applying for a Turkish e-visa and could use some guidance. Here's the situation:

My Schengen visa is valid from October 15 to November 20, 2024, lasting for 35 days. To apply for a Turkish e-visa, I need a valid Schengen visa, which I have. However, the Turkish e-visa system is not allowing me to proceed with my application. The problem seems to be that the Turkish e-visa would permit a 180-day period of validity, during which I can stay for up to 30 days, but my Schengen visa covers only 35 days.

I've reached out to the Turkish Consulate but haven't received a clear answer. Some travel agencies advised that it should be fine as long as my Schengen visa is valid when I enter Turkey. They suggested I set the expiration date of my Schengen visa as ""unlimited"" in the e-visa application to bypass the system limitation.

My question is: Could setting the Schengen visa expiry date to ""unlimited"" in the Turkish e-visa application cause problems at immigration, even though I only plan to stay in Turkey for 4 nights?

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",71,10,1146,194,1

Sell LA Condo for smaller mortgage or rent it out?,"Hi all,

My condo is currently worth about $500K, I still owe about $190K. My mortgage is 3.25% interest and total payment is $900/month and my HOA is $450/month. If I were to rent it out, looks like I can get about $2500/month in rent. Property tax is about $6K a year

If I bought a new house and didn’t sell my condo, my mortgage estimate is $6.5K a month. If I sold my condo, my estimate is mortgage payment is $5.5K a month. My income is ~$340K.

Question: can I just call the seller's broker to see what the seller has authorized them to offer as compensation to the buyer's agent? ,"Pre-NAR settlement, back in January, we'd occasionally see houses with an agent.  Only once did we make an offer on a house and when we did, we signed an exclusive agreement with the agent specific to that property and stating the agent would be paid from the seller's agent's commissions.  Offer was ultimately rejected. 

Post NAR-settlement: last weekend we went to open house (agent wasn't there) and liked what we saw.  We reached out to agent and said can you make an offer.  Agent sent an exclusive agreement for 90 days for all properties in the county requiring us to pay 3% of purchase price to extent not paid from the seller's agent's commissions.  (I get the broader terms since the agent can't take us to tour properties without a signed document). 

That is a very different compensation model.  And honestly, I think my willingness to pay that depends on the new market consensus around what sellers are authorizing their agents to offer as compensation to the buyer's agent.    
  
**Question**: can I just call the seller's broker to see what the seller has authorized them to offer as compensation to the buyer's agent?  If they are offering 2-3% then I feel much better singing the agent's proposed buyer's agreement. ",136,24,1238,221,0

Anyone else notice that Southwest leaves the seatbelt sign on for basically the whole flight? ,"In the past I’ve almost exclusively flown Southwest but lately for various reasons I’ve flown on several other carriers both within the US and internationally. I’ve noticed other airlines like American, United, BA, and Lufthansa all turn their seatbelt sign off before even reaching cruising altitude. This shocked me since on Southwest I’ve had 2-3 hour flights where the seatbelt sign never turned off. Anyone know the reasoning behind this? It seems like this is causing people on Southwest to simply ignore the seatbelt sign since it’s almost like “the boy who cried wolf”. I could see this practice actually hurting someone as I actually noticed people would respect the sign on other airlines, whereas if it’s on all the time then people will simply ignore it and could possibly get up right before dangerous turbulence.

"Buyers won't close due to ""issues"" during walk-through","Signed a contract to sell in May, limiting inspection to only major items. Buyers came back with mostly minor requests (which we agreed to fix anyway) but asked for a new driveway because their inspection flagged it as poor condition. We declined to fix or provide credits as we had another offer SUBSTANTIALLY higher (that came in just hours after we accepted their offer, so we could have canceled during attorney review but felt it was the wrong thing to do). Buyers agreed to move forward without any repair or credits. 

They pushed off closing for a while because they were traveling, which we weren't thrilled about. Some other red flags popped up as well. On the day of closing, their attorney emails our attorney asking for almost $50k because the condition of the property changed since their inspection, citing numerous issues. This was very clearly a money grab and nothing changed since the inspection. We were easily able to prove most of the issues existed previously with photos from before the house was listed. They dropped most of those claims. 

However, they're still claiming there is water seepage in the basement, and the contract says we will deliver the house free of basement seepage. We don't agree that there is seepage and it's our word against theirs. They refused to close. 

After lots of back and forth trying to negotiate credits, we can't come to an agreement. They're not asking to walk away, they just want money from us.  My attorney kept their deposit since they are failing to close and there isn't any proof of seepage. The buyers of course want their deposit back unless we give them something like $35k in credits to close. They're threatening to sue for the deposit back claiming we are breaching the contract. 

Looking for some opinions on how to proceed here, and validation that we are taking the right approach. Our lawyer seems confident we can take damages out of their deposit, and that we should re-list the house and find a new buyer. He isn't a litigator though,  so I'm not sure his opinion on our likelihood of winning in court holds a lot of weight.

I'm debating bringing in an engineer so we have an ""official"" opinion that there is no seepage, although it seems the burden of proof is on the buyers to show there is an issue. I don't think it would get them to close, it might just be useful in court. 

EDIT: thanks for the feedback everyone. Lots of mixed opinions. Most popular answer seems to be ""listen to your attorney"" which is the course we will continue to take. I'll also be hiring an independent third party, that's both a licensed inspector and professional engineer, to perform their own investigation. I'm extremely confident they will not find seepage and it will help bolster our case in court. I'll also be getting a second opinion from a litigation attorney as to our odds of winning. We have detailed records of the long list of issues the buyer brought up during the walk-through, and then later admitting that most of them are inadmissible, which will help to paint a clear picture of their intentions.",54,8,3085,539,0

Babymoon ideas for the Caribbean,"My husband and I are looking to go to an all-inclusive resort in the Caribbean in January. I will be between 25-29 weeks pregnant depending on when we end up going. I’ve already cleared it with my doctor, and she sees no issues with going. We went to the all-inclusive Sandals resort in Antigua last November and was not happy with it. Loved Antigua as a country and the views, water, etc. but not happy with the value of the resort for what we paid. 

We were looking for something not quite as expensive as Antigua for this next trip. We were thinking maybe Aruba, Jamaica, or Punta Cana. Any other suggestions? I love the pretty, crystal clear water. We are going to be focusing more on relaxing rather than excursions (since I won’t be able to do many). I hated having to rush to the beach/pool early in the morning in Antigua to get a chair for the day. I know not all resorts are like this. The food was also terrible in Antigua. We would just like this one to be special since it will likely be the last time going somewhere like this for several years. 

Just looking for input considering safety, views, relaxation, value for your money, etc. 

Thank you. ",32,5,1165,215,1
How do you choose your hotel ?,"I feel like I have been very unlucky with the  last hotels I stayed in (Florence and Prague). I read reviews on Google and Booking after sorting by most recent first but I still was quite unhappy with my choices.

"Complex Real Estate Portfolio, Need Advice ","I have rental properties in New York, Virginia, Illinois and Outside the US. Only 1 property has a mortgage, the rest are paid off. Hence the carrying costs are limited to taxes, insurance, HOA and maintenance. I do not have any living relatives, not married, no children and am thinking more long term, what I should do. The total portfolio is in excess of $6 Million at current valuations. 

I have received conflicting advice, hence I thought to come here and see what the general consensus is. My intent is to setup some type of foundation that survives me. Until I die, I want a decent monthly income to live on.

Depending on how this is setup, can I start the foundation whilst alive. Some advice I’ve been given is to take another loan and pull out the equity and use this money to start the foundation now. Should I create an LLC or trust ? What is the best vehicle for me. Lastly there 2 properties which I would like to sell and considering using the to purchase my retirement home. 

I have spoken to financial advisors and bankers, and they have given me different advice. Who would you recommend I speak further to - as I’m not comfortable with the folks I’ve talked to so far.

NYC itinerary suggestions —no budget,"I’m hoping people can give some suggestions on what activities they would do in NYC if there was no budget (within reason). 

My mother-in-law went through an extremely difficult divorce and lost her house and will be going to NYC with my wife and I this December and we want to make it the most memorable trip possible (and covering all the costs). 

Although I said no budget, we don’t actually have unlimited money so it would only be one of each archetypal activity (museum, play, fine dining, tour(?)). I just don’t want options excluded automatically on the basis of expense. We’re open to something like spending 50% more on the margin for a 10% better experience. 

I was thinking about one fine dining experience, one live show (broadway?), some local cheaper eats (una pizza napolita), one of the art museums (met) but open to any ideas that aren’t usually circulated on the sub for cost reasons. 

Edit:
Adding some suggestions below that have piqued our interest so its easier to track. 

Day 1:

- Dumbo + Brooklyn Bridge
- 2/3 star dinner ( MIL choice)

Day 2:
- Tea service at plaza hotel (near us)
- Spa day on governors island (or shibui spa TBD)

Day 3:
- Museum (transit in brooklyn or met)
- Lunch / offtime pizza at L’industrie
- Rockettes (2x rec so going with it)

Day 4:
- display windows on 5th ave ahead of opera
- Opera (magic flute)

Help my expand my Asia trip,"Hi, I am a single 36M from the UK and I have booked my first solo trip (hurray!) to Japan some weeks ago. Reason I am going alone is because I went through a divorce and I am trying to 'live my life' and proof to myself that I can have fun alone.  I fly to Tokyo mid November and stay for 2 weeks travelling through places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka etc. I am super excited and, admittedly a tad nervous for travelling alone but right now it feels like I got this! 

However, Unexpectedly I just got loads of holidays because of a change in my job. I am basically off between today 3 oct all the way till 1 December (when I come back from Japan). With this I want to move my outbound ticket 2 weeks earlier for a a very small fee, and upon landing in Tokyo, visit South Korea and maybe another country. Tokyo - Seoul is only 2 hours and very affordable hence the choice.

I have two ideas (time span: 4 weeks):

**idea 1:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Bangkok (6 hours) , spend 1 week in Thailand
* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

Also happily take alternative itineraries! Other countries I find interesting are Vietnam,  China and Indonesia.

Sellers are liars ,"Why do sellers get to say that they don't have knowledge of issues with their homes when it's obvious they do. Like you know if you have termites or there are issues with flooding. But they get the option of just checking the ""IDK"" box on the contract. That's an unfair practice. How can you start a contract lying? Then the buyers are just stuck with signing this contract where they really don't have an honest transaction. How do they get away with this?

Why is my partner getting lower Booking rates for every hotel?,"So me and my partner are here sitting in bed, both with our phones open and using the Booking app, searching up dozens of identical hotels after I noticed that for our first few choices hers were all unanimously cheaper than what I was shown for the same property and same room.

An hour later now, half of the hotels have us both getting same rates while the other half are only offering her a discount, or at least a steeper discount than me. Not a single time have I come out cheaper than her. We’ve both been Booking members for almost the exact same amount of time, booked about the same amount (we go back and forth each trip), and are both at the same Genius level as well as the same amount of bookings away from reaching the next level.

What is going on here? I understand d A/B testing or selectively offering different locations and devices certain rates, but we are, for the most part, going into the searches with the exact same parameters.

Both on iPhones, same IP, same Genius level, about the same past spending.

And yet, she’s getting minor to massive discounts every time and I’m stuck more or less just paying the normal rate…

What’s going on?!

**Edit** : u/topfuckr (lol) broke the case wide open, it was 100% the gender choice. I switched my gender over to female and I immediately got all of my partner’s discount offers. “Female” and “Prefer not to say” yielded the discounts while “Male” and “Non-binary” gave me nothing.

**Edit 2** : Someone asked for screenshots (sorry about being late) so here are the shots of the property that set off this entire question:

Are these petty requests from the buyer?,"House went under contract and they just had their inspection done.

The house is old, built in the 50s and a very old man lived there before us. The “water damage” that they’re referring to is a removable panel in a closet to get to the plumbing in-between the drywall… Before purchasing the house we noticed the trim in that closet was very old and rotted and we replaced that upon moving in 3 years ago and have not had any issues since.

Roof help! Getting insured? ,"
Hi! So I posted a week ago that we were under contract for a house in NC and the property has a backup offer. Home inspection came back to recommend a roofer come out to evaluate given the aged and deteriorating shingles. Roofer comes out and does inspection with pictures (in the link provided) and gives his evaluation.

“It is our opinion that the roof is at the end of its lifecycle. The age and wear on the roof is most evident by the granule loss on the shingles. You will see several photo's where you see dark patches on the shingles. This is where the granules have been stripped away and the black asphalt matt of the shingle itself is visible - that means there is little weather protection left on that shingle. There are instances of both hail damage (seen of soft metals) and wind damage. The wind damage is visible in the lines on the roof. This is from tree damage and where the shingles have been lifted (and they creased).

There have been previous repairs made to the roof - you can see previous patches and there are numerous instances where pipe boots, chimney flashings and nail pops have been caulked - but these are usually temporary fixes at best.  Our opinion is that there may be 1-2 years left on this roof before serious issues may occur.”

Roofer is concerned that we may be unable to get the house insured, or that insurance may drop us if they end up doing additional inspection/more thorough appraisal. We don’t know roof age and sellers don’t either. 

Our RE agent says that sellers are getting a divorce and not keen to do repairs. Apparently they aren’t even on talking terms and have split the DD fees individually lol. They have a backup offer. We put down a 5k due diligence fee which we have to forfeit if we walk away (because North Carolina….)

I’m just wondering how can we go around this? Anyone has experiences with being unable to get insurance due to age/condition of roof prior to closing? Could you share your experiences? 

We don’t expect a new roof, but we’re hoping for some concessions. The property is in a highly sought after area in a pretty hot market and also a good price point. We offered 5k over list to get under contract. 

Thanks in advance!!

Shoes for travel (Ireland),"
Hey there, I'm going on a trip to Ireland in a few weeks and I've gained some weight since I was last in Europe so I have some ankle issues and I'm having trouble deciding on shoes. Since I'm going to Ireland I assume it's going to be a lot of walking around, a bit of hiking and pubs/restaurants in my mind.

I was wondering what shoes everyone thinks are the best to wear for travel? I really like the way barefoot sneakers feel but they're not great for walking around in hiking conditions. Do people recommend work boots, hiking boots/shoes, sneakers? Etc?

Tldr, what's the best show for traveling when you'll be walking in cities and hills all day?",26,4,655,118,1
Japan Train Recommendations for Golden Route,"Hello,

Am going to Japan end of November to Early December but am unsure about the best train route and price for Tokyo &gt; Kyoto &gt; Osaka &gt; Tokyo. Initially was considering domestic flights but that may end up becoming more time consuming considering how early one has to get to the airport and time to get there. Then I thought trains would be better but am unsure of where and when to get the best train tickets considering we're going around with suitcases.

Would appreciate any advice!

Bat infestation ,"Under contract with a home and during the home inspection we discovered that there are at least 12-15 bats, possibly more, in the attic. The inspector used the word “infestation”. However, he didn’t really assess any damage done to the attic. I believe he was afraid. Anywho, the seller will be responsible for paying for treatment. But are they terribly difficult to get rid of?

Should I reach out to the new owners?,"TLDR: I suspect a flipper lied during disclosures to the back up offer that just closed. We were the primary offer and walked because of several issues, but a full foundation replacement based on structural engineering report is the main reason. I have the report and communication with the seller together for significant proof the seller was aware of this.

I put an offer on a house that had been sitting significantly past average number of days on the market for the city. It was accepted. It was currently owned by a flipper/investor who did a sub-par performance on the renovations, but this meant we might be getting it at a good deal compared to comp's in the area so we submitted the offer. During the option period we discovered many things that were concerning. The investor/owner said he'd had work done on all that and it shouldn't be any issue at all. We asked for reports/receipts/work contracts to support this and he gave nothing, and also had no issues known during the disclosure.

Among others, the major concern was the foundation. He said he'd had work done for it and it should be perfect...but we hired a structural engineer who said this was a critical foundation issue and would need an entirely replaced foundation. The report also highlighted how this can't be delayed as certain parts of the house are literally not set on the foundation properly and there is significant weight just hanging pulling on the rest of the house, so the fixes should happen immediately. We got several quotes for around 30K. Also considering when major foundation repairs on pier and beam houses take place, there can be other problems occurring from that (both cosmetic and non cosmetic) so it would be conservative to account for 45-60K worth of work when estimating total cost of the foundation problem. The other issues could be delayed, but would cost another 20-40K depending on how we wanted to approach it. Along with the other known issues, this made us decide it was not worth it relative to other houses in the neighborhood.

A month later I saw that this house had sold and the consideration was for 10K more than our offer. It could be that they just absolutely loved it and didn't care about the cost, but there is no chance based on comparable properties that this price + repairs would be a reasonable price, so I don't think the seller disclosed anything we shared with them.

After dealing with this seller who seemed to have a poor moral compass with how he behaved during the process, I suspect he did not disclose the structural engineering report documenting the foundation issues to the new owners, which is of course illegal. I understand that as far as disclosures go, while there is black and white law it can be very challenging to prove what the seller knew or not.

However, we needed to extend our option period when we were under contract. The amendment written by the seller explicitly stated we can only terminate based on the structural report and that we must supply a copy if we choose to terminate. Also there are texts and emails between the seller and our realtor discussing the report. So essentially, if this person was dishonest during disclosures I have all the paperwork sitting neatly bundled together to make a case for the new owners to pursue costs to take care of this issue....

The easiest thing is for me to do nothing and just move on, but that would allow this person to have zero consequences for their actions if they lied. From my understanding it's near impossible for the new owner to discover any of this information on his/her own.

IF I wanted to politely let the new owners know about this information, how should I go about this?",37,8,3702,641,0

"I Need Advice With My Travel Itinerary (Beer Trip, Focusing on Belgium) — It's My 1st Time In Europe","Next year, I'll be taking a 22-day solo trip around Europe to celebrate my 40th birthday, starting with **Belgian Beer Weekend and ending with Oktoberfest**. My trip is a beer trip, as I specialized in beer after college and always wanted to do a trip of this nature.

I'm planning to spend 11 days in Belgium, and I'm asking for advice because I'm having trouble deciding how to get to certain places and what day of the week to visit them. Therefore, **I'll show above my problem, my itinerary with the main places and my doubt (what I need guidance on)**.

*- My problem is:*

I want to stay 2 days in Bamberg (Germany), but for that I will need to rent a car for 4 days in Belgium, while my goal is to make this trip using only public transportation. 

*- My itinerary:*

1. Brussels (5 days)

* Day 1: Poechenellekelder (I will arrive at night in the city and will have time for 1 place)
* Day 2: Belgian Beer World and Belgian Beer Week
* Day 3: Cantillon (with guided tour) and L'Ermitage
* Day 4:  Belgian Beer Week
* Day 5: Delirium Café, A La Morte Subite and Moeder Lambic

2. Malle

* 1 day:  Café Trappisten — Westmalle

3. Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg (The Netherlands — 2 days)  


* Day 1: I don't know yet, but I will go to some brewery
* Day 2: La Trappe (with guided tour) 

4. Hamont-Achel

* 1 day: Achel (with guided tour)

5. Antwerpen

* 1 day: De Koninck (with guided tour) and Cafe Kulminator

6. Chimay

* 1 day: Chimay (with guided tour) 

7. Vleteren

* 1 day: In De Vrede — Westvleteren

8. Florenville

* 1 day: Orval (visiting the museum)

9. Bamberg (Germany)

* 1 day: I'm going to as many breweries as I can.

10. Munich (Germany)

* 4 days: 2 days to Oktoberfest and I still have to decided where to go on the other 2 days

*- My doubts:*

* **To spend 2 days in Bamberg, I'll need to take 1 day off from Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg, visiting Chimay on Saturday, Orval on Sunday and Westvleteren on Monday. So I'd like to ask you:** 

1. If I do this, I will leave Hamont-Achel early on Saturday by train and rent a car. Where do you think is the best place to rent a car and return to the same place on the day I will travel from Vleteren to Bamberg, Brussels or Charleroi?
2. If I rent a car, do you think it's a good idea to stop in Rochefort to buy Rochefort beers on the Sunday between Chimay-Florevenville or the Monday between Florenville-Vestleren? Do you have any suggestions on which store I should buy them from? 
3. If I'm driving, do you recommend staying in Poperinge and using public transport to go to St. Bernardus for lunch and then to Westvleteren or is it better to drive past St. Bernardus, buy some of their beers, leave the car at the hotel and take the bus to Westvleteren? What would be the best way to get back from there? Use the bus or try to book a cab back? 
4. I'll need to change my itinerary for when I leave Brussels, from Tuesday to Friday, to go to the following cities: Malle, Antwerp, Berkel-Enschot/Tilburg and Hamont-Achel, due to the guided tour days at La Trappe, Achel and the opening days of Cafe Kulminator. Therefore, I would have to leave Antwerp on the 07:44AM train, arriving in Tilburg at 08:41AM, so that I could check into the hotel and catch the bus to arrive in time for the 11 o'clock guided tour of La Trappe. Do you think it's too risky to do this? How is the train from Belgium to The Netherlands, is it a smooth ride, does it usually run late or is it like going from one point to another within the country?

* **If I stick to my original itinerary:** 

1. I'll be using public transport from Chimay to Vleteren on Monday, arriving in the early afternoon. So, would you advise me to stay in Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper or Vleteren. To get back to the hotel, I'll have the same dilemma as mentioned, bus or taxi. But if I stay in Vleteren, I'll be able to walk there and back, depending on the distance between the hotel and In De Vrede. What do you think is the best way to proceed here?
2. The following day, Tuesday, I'm going to Florenville to visit Orval, in a journey over 5 hours.  So, would you advise me to leave from Poperinge, Ypres/Ieper, Vleteren or whatever?

If you have any tips on beer stores or beers you like to drink that I could buy, I'd be grateful.  
And I hope you can help me clear up my doubts about my itinerary and help me plan my trip.",100,19,4343,784,1

Solar PPA on home I'm interested in buying,"Received contracts for a home that I would love to call my own.. I knew going in the home had some sort of leased solar... after reviewing contracts I became aware of the following:

The seller states in the home purchase contract the buyer (me) MUST assume the solar lease or buy it out.

The buy out price has a formula in the solar PPA contract, but I do not have a price/number, as I do not have information required to compute the price (nor has the seller contacted the solar company asking for the buy out price)

The solar PPA is for $0.15/kWh with 2.4% yearly escalation (the price increases that amount each year). The contract states a minimum production rate and we are billed at whatever it PRODUCES (not what we use). Excess produced is sold back to the utility company at 1:1, but they are moving to TOU (time of use) billing, which means this becomes less desirable. It also means if the 2.4% outpaces the utility rates, I am actively losing money over this, not even factoring in the solar company owns my roof.

The contract was started in 2016 and is a 20 year contract, so I'd be on the hook for another 12ish years. Also the company the PPA is signed with went under and has since been resold to some other company, so I am not sure who currently gets paid and/or services/maintains the panels.

The roof was stated to be 20 years old in the home purchase contract, and my inspector showed me pictures and said there are missing shingles and parts of the roof which need to be fixed/replaced, including a part potentially under a solar panel. No evidence of leaks.

We went in about 35k over asking on a house listed around 1M.

My thoughts are that we should not be forced to assume the sellers lease (that was their decision to do that). The solar contract states the current owner must buy it out if the person they are selling their house to refuses to take it over, but, the home purchase agreement has language forcing me to accept the transfer of the PPA lease/contract, which I presume means I would default the home purchase contract if I refuse to take it over, and lose my EMD.



Any recommendations on how to navigate this?

My thoughts are to ask the seller to offer a concession on the home purchase price to offset 100% or at least 65% of the PPA buyout, which I could then decide to buy out when I redo the roof. Is this unreasonable?

We have not signed any contracts yet.",42,8,2411,435,0

CA - Title Insurance where backyard fence is a few feet onto neighboring lot,"Hey All - in escrow and ran into a situation.  Turns out one of the side yard fences may be onto a neighboring lot owned by the city.  It's been standing for 40+ years and as that area is unusable by the city, I imagine noone has ever cared.

Will this cause any issues with getting lender title insurance (and thus a mortgage) on my property?

Buyer Beware,"After the recent NAR ruling took effect, many realtors are saying that it is now required that house buyers sign a buyers agreement in order to view a house. This is not true. The truth is that the buyers agreement only needs to be signed for the agent to work as your buyers agent, and essentially is your agreement to work with the buyers agent as your agent.

Read what a realtor hands to you VERY CAREFULLY before signing, especially if you only wanted to view a property and are not ready to choose a buyers agent. Realtors are passing buyers agreements off as routine paper work that is ""required"" to be signed in order for them to show the house.

Agents are using this paperwork to entrap potential buyers into a legally binding agreement that requires the buyer to use them as their sole and exclusive agent for a determined amount of time.

The paperwork may be filled out already and will say something along the lines of:

SERVICES PROVIDED. Buyer hereby agrees to hire the Agency on a(n): (check one)

☐ - Exclusive Basis. To accept the terms of this Agreement and communicate with the
Agency on an exclusive basis in their efforts to assist in acquiring real property that
meets the wants and needs of the Buyer through either purchase, option, exchange, 
trade, or lease. The Commission, under an exclusive basis, is due and payable even 
under the circumstance the Buyer acquires real property on their own without the 
assistance or involvement of the Agency.

☐ - Non-Exclusive Basis. To accept the terms of this Agreement and communicate
with the Agency on a non-exclusive basis in their efforts to assist in acquiring real
property that meets the wants and needs of the Buyer through either purchase, option, 
exchange, trade, or lease. The Commission, under a non-exclusive basis, is due and 
payable only if the Buyer acquires real property with the assistance and involvement of 
the Agency. In the event the Buyer purchases real property during the Listing Period 
without the use of the Agency, the Agency shall not be due a Commission.

If you are not wanting to use the agent showing you the property as your agent for buying:

1. Do not sign the paperwork

OR

2. Make sure that the paperwork outlines that the agent showing you the property is working on a non-exclusive basis AND the remainder of the paperwork says nothing obligating you to pay commission to the agent showing you the property unless you choose to place an offer on the property through them (the agent).

You can politely decline and say that you haven't yet decided who you want to represent you as your buyers agent, but you are open to the possibility of using them if they seem like a good fit.

OTHERWISE

You may be legally obligated to pay commission to this buyers agent that you just met and just learned the name of, even if you decided to work with another agent, until the contract that you signed expires. Yes, that could mean paying commission to TWO buyers agents.

Past destinations include Amalfi coast, Greek islands, Puerto Rico, Aruba, Cancun, Paris, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Hawaii, Maine.

Destinations we are considering: Turkey (safety concerns?), Spain (Mallorca vs Basque Country), Amsterdam, Croatia, Japan, somewhere else in Asia? (Not sure if worth the flight with only 10days)

What to say to listing agent who claims he cannot legally show me a home without a buyers agent agreement in place? ,"Today, a listing agent said, ""If you call me as an unrepresented buyer interested in this property, I cannot legally show you the property without having a buyer's agent agreement in place that states I am your agent and what the buyers agent compensation will be, or you have to have your own buyer's agent."" In other words, he is claiming that it is illegal for a seller's agent to show their listed property to an unrepresented buyer.

How do you get around this? We are willing to hire a real estate attorney to handle drafting the offer and any remaining documents in the transaction should our offer be accepted.

How do you explain to a listing/sellers agent that they can show you the house (as the listing agent) without being your agent?

Need advice on a rent-to-own,"So the wife and I recently purchased a new home, moved, all that. However we still own the old home and I have a really good friend that's currently renting a crappy place. Not going to get too into the details but a while back he got hired on at the place I work, is finally making respectable money and getting going on building his life up. Bro kinda started out on hard mode and I've been really rooting for him and proud of my boi as he improves his position. 

Now, the thing I need advice on. He wants to buy my old home and I'm all for it. After he brought it up the wife and I talked and we were like why not? Give him a little lower price than we would ask on the market and go private sale and not have the house sit on the market for months while getting him a house he really wants and setting him up. Win/win. We're a rural community and home prices are pretty low compared to the rest of the country. That being said, he couldn't get the financing on his own (DTI) and with his wife on he said the bank couldn't do it with his lack of employment history. He'll get the employment history in just a few months and suggested a rent-to-own as an option. Wife and I have been pretty uninterested in being ""landlords"" or anything. Buddy says he understands if that's something we can't do and I would love to help the guy out but I'm not familiar enough with this stuff. We do pretty well for a couple under 30 and I'm just worried that if we did a short term rent-to-own maybe he wouldn't get approved still and then we're either stuck as rental owners with a friend renting which I'm sure everybody would agree is not an ideal situation or he'd have to move out and find a new place with a kiddo on the way around that time. 

I just don't know. He's the kind of guy from the scene in The Town ""Whose car we gonna take?"" and I'd love to help the guy out but I'm afraid of going forward with it and then losing a friend over business and all that kinda stuff. I also feel shitty telling him ""Sorry bro I can't do it"" and putting it on the market. 

Look forward to hearing what some of you have for advice",28,5,2116,417,0
Just married and about to close but documents still say unmarried,"Hi

I just got married a few weeks ago right after putting an offer in on a house. We haven’t closed yet but I just noticed the paperwork lists us as unmarried single people. Is this something I need to worry about or do I need to push for them to update to married before we close? 

For context, we both make about the same amount of money, contributed almost equally to the downpayment, and have almost identical credit scores. We live and are buying in Washington state.

If it’s only for cosmetic reasons, I don’t particularly care. I just don’t want to miss out on legal protections that we’re entitled to.

Selling home and our buyers are asking for every line item from the inspection to be repaired,"Is this a typical ask?

Sold home to an investor,"About a year ago, my house was sold to an ""investor"". Although the house is still in my name, there has been a transfer of the deed. A few months back, the investor and I had a brief conversation. The one thing he stated was that the house remaining in my name would improve my credit, until he re-financed it. 

The other day I asked if I would be notified when the house is taken out of my name. The reply was ""Absolutely!! But that won't be for a few years."" Fast forward to the present (October 2024) I receive emails from credit reporting sites. The mortgage is 30 days past due. Therefore, I was knocked in the head with -30 &amp; -31 to my credit report. I reached out to the investor (furious) I told the the house needed to be out of name soon. I cannot live my life in limbo (never knowing when there will be a late mortgage payment). \*\*S.N. I was actually in the car shopping market until this shen-ding happened!\*\*

He first stated that there were some accounting issues and that the house was put on auto pay but somehow slipped off."" Have you ever heard of an account ""slipping off"" auto-pay?? After a phone call &amp; several text messages later to the investor, I received a call. He stated that things were good, unfortunately this happens (accounts slip off auto-pay &amp; that this was the MORTGAGE company 's fault!) I asked if this is the case, shouldn't they be able to reverse it? ""No because it is already done"" was his reply. 

\*\*\*I was able to get mortgage payment information via the automated service and I discovered that September's mortgage is STILL due and now October's mortgage is due.\*\*\*

I spoke to my real estate agent. He went to locate a document. When he found it &amp; opened it, it appeared to be in Chinese! He was looking to see if he included a ""30 day late on mortgage"" clause...meaning I could reclaim my house back if this happened.

"Complex situation, need any help or advice you can provide. ","First off, thanks for taking the time to look at this. We are probably going to have to hire a lawyer for all this, but I was hoping to get some opinions or advice before we jump in. Here is the background information.

My grandpa is currently in the midst of passing away. As such, his home is currently held by a trust. My understanding from my mother is that they way everything is written up, the house will be sold and the proceeds split 50/50 between my mother and her brother (my grandpa's children). My mother is insistent that the home remain in the family as it is a fairly nice place in a decent location. She really wants me to buy it, but I have no interest in taking on a mortgage at this time due to multiple reasons. I bought my house after the housing market crash back in like 2008 when it was in foreclosure so I got it insanely cheap and own it outright. Also, my current home is basically a construction zone as I have been remodeling the entire thing since all my kids have grown and left the house. As such, I am not in a position to sell my house at the moment without taking a huge loss on what I could get for it later when it is finished. 

Knowing all of this, my mother has said to me that she wants to buy the house from the trust with the other money she is getting from my grandpa passing. By doing this, she thinks that half the money will go to her brother and she will just get half of it back. Then she wants me to have the house and pay her slowly over the next few years while working on my current house so that when I do sell my house I can pay her whatever is left on the total that she spent and she would sign it over to me. Basically a no interest rent to own situation. Clearly for me this is a huge opportunity as it would allow me to have a newer and nicer home without having to pay almost double the cost of the home due to the interest on the mortgage. 

I have several questions regarding this whole scenario:

1. Is there a cheap and easy way that my mother can work with the trust and her brother to just sign it over to either me or her to avoid having to do the whole ""sale"" thing as she is basically buying it from herself?
2. She is fine with it going directly into my name. But I thought it would be better for her to put it in her name now. That way, if something were to happen to me during the next few years she would have all the money I paid her plus still retain the rights to the house. Basically insurance against losing out on the value of the house. Not sure which way is best to proceed on this. 
3. Can this all be done without including a real estate agent? As the house will never really need to be listed, or shown to other buyers, I see no reason why we would pay someone $10-12k for my mother to buy the house from herself. 
4. If this can all be handled just with an attorney and my mother and her brother signing off on it, what do you think the total cost of the ""sale"" would be? What I mean is how much do you think a lawyer will cost and since no agent or bank or anything will be used, I assume there would be no other costs than just transferring the title? Am I missing something here?
5. If you have any other advice or anything to add to this scenario, feel free to include that. We are both completely in the dark on this one, but don't want to pay tons of extra money that doesn't need to be spent just because we are clueless and someone saw an easy mark. 

If you got this far, thanks again for taking the time to help. Any and all comments and advice or information is welcome. We live in Michigan, if that affects the legal side of it all.

You might be doing solo travel wrong…,"See a lot of posts here and r/solotravel about folks disliking solo travel because they’re spending their whole trips alone. 

If you want to be alone solo traveling, that’s great! But if you’re new to solo trips and like to socialize, putting in effort to make new friends is part of the experience. There are a lot of ways to do this, so I thought I’d spitball some of the things I do to meet both travelers and locals when I travel alone.

- Hostels: The most straightforward way to make friends, always loads of other solo travelers in these environments who are quite open to new connections.

- Food/walking tours: Most tourist towns have ‘free’ walking tours where other travelers congregate, and the tours are really conducive to conversation.

- Language exchanges: Very common at hostels (you don’t have to be a guest!) and restaurants/bars in many cities, language exchanges can be a great way to meet locals who want to practice new languages and for you to pick up some of the local lingo yourself.

- Couchsurfing: If you’re nervous about staying at a stranger’s house, Couchsurfing also offers meetups in public places where locals interested in showing travelers around come and hang out. I’ve been shocked how easily I’ve met local people who are really enthusiastic about inviting me into their lives, I think for some who don’t have the time or means to travel this is a way for them to experience some of the fun and spontaneity of travel in their home towns.

- Hobbies: Sharing your mutual interests is IMO the most organic way to make new friends. I love to draw and often bring my sketchbook to have a few drinks at the local bar. I’m almost always approached by other artists or laypeople curious about my art.

It’s not for everyone but I am an avid salsa dancer and currently traveling in Latin America where there are socials in most towns I visit. The dance floor is an intentionally open environment and a comfortable place to show up alone and come away with a bunch of new local friends who share your passion. 

Regardless of what hobby you love, there are always classes or meetups in most places; or you could try picking up something new while you’re on the road.



Curious if other Redditors have different approaches for socializing on their solo travels they’d like to share here for inspiration. I kind of shake my head when I see posts saying “I traveled to Kazakhstan and am staying in a hotel alone and haven’t tried to learn the language, I’m lonely and decided I don’t like solo traveling!”. 

It‘s ok that solo isn’t for everyone but if you want to share these trips with new friends you have to take an active role in cultivating that experience. Don’t knock solo traveling just cause you’re doing it wrong!",37,7,2755,479,1

Choosing/Changing Realtor Etiquette,"I'm probably over thinking this, but I'm curious what others would do in this situation. 

We're thinking about putting our home on the market soon and buying a larger house. I've become friendly with a bunch of my neighbors, and one of them is a realtor. We text about neighborhood gossip and will chat when we run into each other, but we also don't ""hang out"". 

The realtor I used 7 years ago to buy my current house was fine - she was the realtor for a bunch of my work colleagues at the time. I wouldn't say she was amazing - she didn't really proactively send me a listings - in fact, my coworker found the listing for the house I ended up buying on zillow, but she was easy to work with and guided me through the process well enough. She's been very active in keeping up the realtor/client relationship - she will drop off little seasonal gifts, keeps up through social media, and has reached out about helping us find a new place when we need to (I bought my house as a single gal, and I'm now part of a family of 4).

I feel like I would like to use my neighbor since we definitely have more of a relationship, but not so close a relationship that if things went badly it would ruin anything. She also obviously knows the neighborhood really well. But I would also feel bad if my old realtor found out I didn't use her - they both work for the same brokerage, although it's a fairly large brokerage in a medium-sized city. 

What would other's do? Thanks for the perspective!",35,3,1484,279,0

Why do people don't like Paris,"I've spent 9 days in Paris and it was just awesome. I am 20yo female with little knowledge of French, but no one disrespected me or was rude to me. I don't understand why people say French are rude or don't like Paris.
To me Paris is a clean city. I come from south America and there definitely the city is dirty and smells bad, but Paris was just normal for a metropolitan city. 
I understand French people have their way of being. Politeness is KEY. Always I was arriving in places speaking in my limited french ""bonjour, si vous plais je vous prendre.."" and people would even help me by correcting when I say something wrong. But always in a kind way they would do that, smiling and attentive.

Adding my name to deed of father's home?,"My mother has passed and my father is the only one on the deed currently. The home is completely paid off and he's on disability so the property taxes are exempt. My father is bipolar and the reason I mention that is his next door neighbor flips homes and keeps coming over with cash offers for the house. My dad when he's level headed knows that's a bad idea but I think he's afraid the guy will come back with an offer at a weak moment and he will make a mistake. So he's asking if I can be added to the deed and/or power of attorney so nothing like that occurs.

Would you rather a group trip or just travel with your partner?,"Recently my (M30) GF(F32) and I did a trip to europe with our 2 closest friends (F31 M33 who arent dating each other). 

My GF and I had done a europe trip last year (2023) just us 2 and it went amazing (we were FwB when it started and when it ended we decided to date). We never fought and the trip was very hectic. This year we decided that maybe it might be nice if we each invited our closest friend. We didnt know what to expect for the 2024 trip but F31 and M33 are our closest friends and we have done smaller trips with them and have enjoyed it. The 2024 trip was a success with a few smaller inconveniences. Basically my GF and I felt F31 and M33 werent as compatible of travel buddies as we thought theyd be for a trip like this. Alot of minor things like they would wake up late while my GF and I wanted to attack the day early. it was a roadtrip so it was hard to just leave them at the house if we were doing a day trip an hour away and we felt like their parents waking them up. Sometimes we had to wait an extra hour or 2 for them. One day my GF felt she had to take care of F31 after she went out all night drinking and was not feeling good the next day. My GF went out with us the next day but then left early after it started to rain to check up on F31 and stayed in all day and then regretted not being able to see the city that day as it was our only chance to see the city. 

After the trip my GF and I discussed how we felt inviting others and compared it to our 2023 trip. We both agreed that it was more fun when it was just us and agreed if we do one next year it would be just us 2.  It juts seems her and I are just compatible when travelling and we dont feel the need to have to entertain or adjust to others. Most of my friends though arent that compatible travellers with their partners. Like they'd rather do a boys trip (or a group trip) and the boys go one side and the girls go the other. Its made me wonder how common it is for partners to enjoy trips (especially long trips) just when its the two of them.

Why haven't buyer's agreements changed with the rules changing?,"Not an agent, not a lawyer - just somebody that's never signed a buyer's agreement until I've seen a couple houses with a realtor (in a few states now over the last 10-15 years).

I understand not wasting an agent's time and also for a seller and their agent to know who is in their home, totally get it.

That said, how come nobody seems to have come up with some new type of buyer's agreement?

For example...write it up so that the buyer pays per showing and if they end up under contract on something with that buyer's agent the monies already paid get credited to the buyer out of the commission %?  This would cover the buyer's agent for their time REGARDLESS and let the buyer recoup those expenses if they're serious about buying.",63,9,738,134,0

Machu Picchu weight loss,"Hey y’all! 

My family is looking at going to Peru to hike the Inca Trail this December around Christmas. I’m super pumped, I’ve always wanted to do this, so I have no objections. However, I’ve been thinking about the logistics, and am feeling a little bit hesitant now.

I am very concerned that I will lose weight during the hike. I’m vegan (I am willing to just be vegetarian during the hike for convenience), but I’m nervous that the food offerings will not be sufficient to replace all the calories lost during the days. I’ve also seen some people saying they became ill from either altitude, I’ll bring altitude pills, or the food.

Should I get an MBA? Any advice is appreciated. ,"To give you a little bit of my background, I am a 22 year old recent college graduate with a bachelors degree in finance, specializing in real estate. I'm from the Midwest, but I was very blessed with an opportunity to move across country and work for my uncle's fencing company in South Florida. Currently, he has me doing commercial sales / estimates, where I am able to network with different contractors daily. This was not even a department before I moved here in June '24, so I alone am forming all of these relationships with contractors. I feel like I am in a very good spot with how young I am right now. I am focused on learning / being a sponge daily, and I do not take this position for granted. However, this is not my end goal. 
 
I have always had an interest in real estate, specifically my goal is to get into real estate development or investing one day. Being in the position I am now makes me want to achieve this goal even more. To achieve this goal, I feel like my best path is to get an MBA, but I do not know that for sure. I have done some research, and I'm just not sure if I should just get a general MBA, or continue my specialization in real estate. I know that this is the job market I want to get into, and I feel like it is my passion. I just don't know how to get there. I've looked at some smaller online MBAs, such as University of Illinois, or Southern Illinois University (where I graduated,) but these programs are not impressively high ranking at all. 
 
I guess why I came on here is to try to hear someone's point of view that has done it, or even working to achieve the same goal I am. I'm mainly looking at online MBAs, and my questions are: Is it even worth it in 2024 to get an MBA to achieve my goal? Specifically, should I go to a smaller, less expensive school, or spend thousands more to go to a well ranked one? Should I specialize, or is a general online MBA fine? Should I even do an online MBA, or would it be worth the money to invest in a on campus one? Again, please note that I work full time.
 
I really hope someone on here can help me out, I just want some different points of view on this. I've prayed and prayed, but I do not know what to do. I'm really young, and I acknowledge that I have lots of time, but I am an overthinker that has always had higher than average goals. Thank you for your time, any advise is appreciated!

How to determine sq footage for listing purposes?,"So our home was listed at ~3100 sq ft. That includes the finished basement, which is 1100sq ft by itself. That means the top two floors are roughly 2k sq ft. When looking for a new home, I noticed the listings only mentioned the area on the top two floors and never factor in the finished basement. What I'm curious about is I understand cost per sq footage is important so why would my house list include all 3 floors but these other homes do not?

Edit:

But more context that I forgot to add. What's considered below grade? Our basement is a walkout, from the front you can't tell this but from the back it looks like a three story home.

My mention of listed it's the what's on the main page right by the price of the house. I've seen listing where it breaks down below grade and above grade. Mine just happens to have total. When I look at other homes, the SQ ft listed by the price is typically above grade. You expand the listing and it does show a separate line item for below grade.",49,8,991,187,0

Will we be priced out in 3 years? ,"Hello! My partner and I had our first child this year and within several months we went from being content to rent our apartment to feeling the urge to own a home immediately. We’ve been saving for years and have realized what is on the market where we live (northeastern United States) is all the very top of our budget. Starter homes for a young family just don’t really exist here. We’ve spent a month looking and the places we can almost just afford aren’t working out and our offers keep getting rejected. Assuming that’s because we’re offering asking price instead of offering over. We’re kind of realizing now that we will have a little more money to play with in 3 years when we’re no longer paying for childcare (a whole other insane cost). Our fear there is that home prices are just going to keep going up in our area and that we’d be better to just be house poor now while we can still kind of afford a house. 

I know no one here is a mind reader but in general, do we think the market will rise that significantly in the next 3-5 years? Should we just bite the bullet and buy a place now or wait a few years when we’ll have a little more breathing room?

ESTA denied ,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a stressful situation and would appreciate any advice. I’m traveling to the United States soon, and I applied for the ESTA for myself and my family members, including my cousin and uncle.

Which places in South-East Asia is enjoyable in January?,"Me and my boyfriend are planning on taking a vacation in January to somewhere warm, and would love some advice/ insight/ suggestions! We live in Scandinavia so the days in winter are long, dark and cold, especially January. We´re both prone to winter depression, so now that we have the opportunity for a vacation in January, we´re planning on taking it. Indonesia has been an option we have been considering, and we wouldmlove to go there, but it seems as though the rain season is at it´s peak in January in parts of Indonesia. Though the rain itself doesn´t bother us that much, the high humidity does.

For context we would love to stay somewhere that´s not super mainstream or full of resorts. If we find a nice area, we´ll look into the opportunity of renting a nice little place for a couple weeks, somewhere by the coast, somewhere quiet. Preferably not around the biggest cities, but located near a village or something along those lines. We love good food but our budget doesn´t allow us fine dining, but that´s not a problem, somewhere with good local food is more than enough! We would love to stay somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture! We also love to surf and swim (we´re both beginners at surfing though) , but having that oppurtunity is also a big part of the vacation.

To summarize; we would love advice / suggestions on somewhere to go on vacation in south-east Asia that´s not to touristic and not too overflooded with rain and high humidity in January. Preferably somewhere with buddhistic/hinduistic culture, where it´s possible to surf. Any suggestions or general advice is very appreciated! Thank you!!

Have a great day!",56,9,1653,280,1

Is there a way to purchase a house without a 20% down payment if you already own one but are going through a divorce?,"Hello all,

 I am sorry if this is a stupid question, but I am a bit overwhelmed emotionally. I currently am on the mortgage and deed of a house I purchased with my husband four years ago, but I am now facing the possibility of a divorce. I will be moving with three cats and a dog, and would like to not pay stupid fees at an apartment complex, or pay twice what my mortgage is now on a house to rent. Is there a way to purchase a house without a huge downpayment, even though I've already used my FHA on the first house?

Thank you in advance for any advice. ",117,24,561,112,0

Purchasing $12k mobile home for first investment property ,"Hi, I know very little about real estate investing but I came across an opportunity to purchase a $12k mobile home.

Fire door inspection. ,"Hello, just have a few questions that I’m not sure if this is the right place for answers or not so just let me know. 

Anyway, me and my partner recently mortgaged a 2 bedroom apartment about 6 months ago in the UK. Since then we have had two fire door inspections, the first one was fine they had no issues and it was rather sudden since we had quite literally just moved in. But the second one has just happened and we received an email saying that the door doesn’t meet fire safety protocol? We haven’t touched the door other than opening and closing it and they have now quoted us £450 to fix it to meet the standards. 

I feel as if they’re taking advantage of us. We have already had to spend £3,000 on a new boiler since the one in the apartment was already knackered after a few weeks living here. So this added charge out of nowhere is just random. 

Thank you. ",22,4,872,168,0

Japan first timer / first time overseas / looking for advice,"Hey guys! My partner and I are planning to travel to Japan next year 2025 for the first time. Actually it's our first time overseas ever. I feel fairly prepared. I've been talking to a lot of people and I've gotten a lot of information from them. I also listen to a really good podcast called sightseeing Japan on Spotify if anyone is interested. 

I just need advice mostly about the cherry blossom season. We really want to see this of course as does everyone it seems haha. But I'm really concerned about the crowds and whether it's going to ruin our trip. Obviously I'm prepared to deal with crowds, but does anyone have any experience during Cherry Blossom season versus outside of the season? The other time of year I was thinking of going was during November which is Autumn. It looks beautiful, and nice weather. However, I'm being a bit greedy here and I don't really want to wait until this time next year haha. So I might just have to deal with the crowds. As you can imagine being our first time overseas, I'm very, very excited but also very overwhelmed and a little scared.

Our basic plan is to fly into Tokyo and go to Disneyland as well as many other attractions and districts here. Then we'll go to mount Fuji and may stay closer to the mountain or travel by day from Tokyo. However, I think with the crowds the travel by day may take too long and may chip into too much of our time around the mountain. So I'm not really sure what to do here. I've heard the buses can line up for hours and hours but during Cherry Blossom season, it may be worse or course? Or is it busy regardless? I was also interested in climbing mount Fuji or hiking from station 5. However, obviously we would need to go during climbing season, but that's summer and it seems too hot. My birthday is in July and waiting till July isn't too bad so perhaps we could. However, how's the weather around this time? Does it make it unenjoyable? 

The next plan is to travel on the on the shinkansen to Osaka and go to Nara and Hiroshima for day trips. From here we would also visit Kyoto. I think I'd still like to book some accommodation in Kyoto so we can enjoy the peaceful side of it. And not worry about lining up on buses for hours to get there. I've heard in the podcast I listen to that if you're doing day trips to Kyoto from Osaka the buses into the town can take about 4 hours out of your day, which really chips into your time to explore Kyoto and really get the most out of seeing the temples. So I'm considering staying in Kyoto for 2 to 3 days to really enjoy the experience and not worry too much about public transport. Thoughts?

I don't really know where else to go from here. We want to spend 3 to 4 weeks in Japan. Rough idea was one week in Tokyo one week in Osaka a couple of days around mount Fuji and a couple of days around Kyoto. Obviously with day trips to Nara and Hiroshima thrown in. What else would you do/where else would you recommend going?

We would love to see the snow in Japan and try snowboarding at some point. However, this may be a separate trip during winter time, as this time around, I think we're going to want to see majority of the culture of Japan in all different cities and the snowy weather may hinder this. We are from Australia so are used to hot weather.

We are big nerds and gamers so obviously looking forward to experiencing that culture in Tokyo and Akihabara, and Universal. But we're also into fitness, so hiking and exploring the outskirts of Japan would also be exciting and have a nice contrast to the cities where we can enjoy the peaceful culture. So we're really open to anything. Of course in Osaka will go to Universal studios and all the main attractions. But during cherry blossom season who has experience here and do you think we should wait a bit longer, and go outside of the season? Is it really so busy that you can't enjoy it? Or can you just plan around it and stay closer to the attractions/book ahead so there's less crowds/bus travel, etc?? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you 😁",60,11,4054,757,1
"International trip soon, needing luggage advice for Christmas gift","

Switzerland April Trip Advice ,"Hi, I am going to go to Milan Design week up until the 10th of April 2025, which is the day I want to leave to go to Switzerland. Some info: I want to buy a Swiss train travel pass and I want to stay in Switzerland till the 13th April (including) max. So around four days in total. I will not have a car during this time and I have no hiking experience whatsoever, which is why i think I should steer clear of doing that. I also need to go to Stuttgart to catch my flight back home. My final day and night in Switzerland (for this trip) i was thinking could be spent in Zurich. I can go two routes.
1. From Milan to Zermatt (I want to visit Matterhorn)  from their I want to go to Interlaken, where I was planning on booking a two night stay. Those two days I wanted to go to Oeschinen lake (however I heard that the cable car is shut during April?), the Jungfraujoch and Grindelwald. Whilst at Grindelwald I was thinking that I could go on a toboggan but I am not sure those are opened either? If not would there be a winter toboggan opened in the area?  Then I was thinking of going on the Lucerne Interlaken Express- hoping to site see a bit of Lauterbrunnen as well as Lucerne. I am not sure if this would be possible in just one day? So I was also thinking of staying in Lucerne for the night too before heading to Zurich 

2. Go from Milan to St Moritz to catch the Glacier express into Zermatt and then hopefully head into Interlaken all in the same day (does anyone know of a direct bus/train from Milan to St Moritz ? ) and then follow the exact same things as I mentioned above. 

A third option would be to go from Milan to St Moritz and then go on the Bernina Express to Chur. I heard that there was a winter toboggan there too. I could stay a night then make my way into Lauterbrunnen and Lucerne for two nights.
 
I think I would prefer to go with the second option but I am skeptical that I would have enough time in the day to go from Milan to St Moritz and then Zermatt and end my day in Interlaken 
Could anyone give me any tips/advice on any of the above mentioned options? 

Also if anyone has gone paragliding in the Swiss alps, how was it (place/time/cost)?

Anyone taken a drone to Zimbabwe before?,"Hi, wondering if anyone can help me out? I'm flying into Victoria Falls Airport, staying for two nights and then travelling by road to Botswana. I'll have my DJI Mini 3 with me but I won't be flying it in Zimbabwe at all given I'll only be in Victoria Falls.

I've read that I need approval to bring a drone into Zimbabwe. I think the process is to get approval from the CAAZ and then use that to get a temporary import permit from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.

I have tried several times to contact the CAAZ to get approval and pay the registration fee but have gotten nowhere. I've contacted the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and they've advised me to ""bring all relevant paperwork and apply for an Application for Temporary Importation Privilege"" at the port of entry.

The drone will be in my carry on and I'm not even sure they scan carry on bags on arrival, that said I'd still rather abide by the regulations but they're not making it easy.

Customs in Jamaica- What do I need to declare? (If anything),"Hi all, I've never flown out of the US before, or traveled internationally on my own before. I'm also a bit of an overthinker at times.

Also, the line ""I have goods exceeding the value of my (our) personal duty-free allowance,"" with the allowance being around $1000 I believe.

Is my first choice causing remorse for the second?,"So My husband and I bought a house over a year ago. It was small, cute and in a lovely nature filled environment. The fact that it was so small kept bothering me a lot, everything had to be considered before buying, even the car because of the small garage. Then we had family guests almost all of the last year, which made things worse. Last month, we were in a more rural area for a pumpkin farm and came across an amazing updated house, lots of space  , perfect. After looking into the area more, I realized it probably was not the town I wanted to be in, which led us to look for similar properties in other towns. We came across one which required more updates than the other but was 15% less than the first. Made an offer and they accepted. I felt nervous to proceed beyond the attorney review but did. We have an inspection contingency and I think I may have been expecting it could get me out of the purchase, if I changed my mind. Well the house seems to have no real issues so don’t think that is an option anymore.

Is this just typical nerves/ remorse or will the first house we loved just hang over my head forever? It just feels like I chose this as a substitute that doesn’t really match the first and feel nervous to move again to a house we don’t “LOVE”.",50,9,1271,245,0
First-timer Panic | FHA streamline,"
First-time home buyer panic – Am I missing something huge in my FHA streamline refi closing disclosures or is this normal?!

Hey Reddit, I’m kind of freaking out and could really use some advice from anyone who’s been in my shoes. I’m a first-time home buyer (first in my family, too), and I just got my FHA streamline refi closing disclosures. On the surface, things seem great—my monthly mortgage payment is dropping by $400, and my interest rate is going down from 7.5% to 5.5%. So why do I feel like I’m missing some massive red flag?

Here’s where I’m stuck: half of the closing costs are being financed. It sounded fine at first, but now I’m second-guessing everything. Is this normal for a FHA streamline refi? Or am I walking into a bad deal without realizing it? The idea of this much debt has me getting serious cold feet, and I honestly don’t know if I’m making the right call.

I don’t have anyone in my family who’s been through this before, so I’m relying on you all for some much-needed guidance. Am I being ripped off here? Are these costs standard, or is there something sneaky I’m overlooking?

Help me, Reddit Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope. Seriously. Any and all advice is massively appreciated—thank you!

4-Day Trip in Late October - Iceland or Tromsø Without a Car? Need Recommendations!,"Hey fellow travelers!

I'm planning a 4-day trip at the end of October and am torn between Iceland and Tromsø. I'll be traveling without a car, so I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations for either destination.

**A bit more context:**

* **No car**: I’m relying on public transport, guided tours, and walking.
* **Late October**: I'm aware it's shoulder season, so weather and daylight are a consideration.
* **Main interests**: Northern lights, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences!

**Iceland**: I’d love to visit some of the major sights like the Golden Circle, Blue Lagoon, and maybe do some Northern Lights tours. Given that I won’t have a car, is it feasible to experience these places through guided tours based out of Reykjavik? How accessible are things this time of year?

**Tromsø**: I've heard Tromsø is great for seeing the aurora and seems a bit more compact, which might be easier without a car. Are there enough tours and activities to keep me busy for four days, or would I run out of things to do? I'd be interested in reindeer experiences, Sami culture, and maybe even whale watching.

**Questions:**

1. Which destination do you think is better for a 4-day, car-less adventure?
2. How easy is it to get around without a car in each location?
3. Is either location particularly better for the end of October in terms of activities and weather?

Any thoughts or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much!",83,14,1471,234,1

 Help with Spain Itinerary and Travel Timing,"Hi everyone!

The wifey &amp; I are planning a trip to Spain in either March or April and could use some advice. We’ll be landing at Madrid airport and plan to do the entire trip using train to commute from city to city.. Here’s what I’m considering:

**Timing:**

* Is March a better choice due to lower crowds and costs, despite being colder? I’ve heard April might be crowded due to school holidays and Easter. Is the warmer weather worth the extra expense? How about May? Will things be more expensive then?

**Itinerary:** 

* We’re planning to visit:
   * **Madrid (4 days)**
   * **Granada (2 days)**
   * **Seville (3 days)**
   * **Valencia (2 days)**

  
Does this order make sense? Are the number of days in each city sufficient, or would you recommend any changes? We would like to do the trip in 10-11 days.

**Day Trips:**

* How about day trips to Toledo and Córdoba? Are they worth the time?
* Should we include Malaga too?

**Other Tips:**

* Is there anything else we should keep in mind while planning? For now we plan to cover just the southern part of Spain.

"17 year old homeseller here, need advice ","I had a relative pass away recently and now it’s the responsibility of me and my siblings as heirs of the estate, to tend the to house and make it as presentable as possible so that it can be sold for maximum value.

Only problem is that the house is an hour away from us and we barely have any time on our hands. The property is overgrown now, the grass hasn’t been cut this summer at all so now there are weeds in the backyard that are taller than me and the inside of the house needs to be emptied out basically completely. 

The estate is a waterfront property with a two-story house, it was estimated to be around $450K if sold the way it is.

Would it be terrible if we sold it the way it is? Is working on it until it is completely “ready” to sell way better for the value? Who could I hire to do the work for me? (cutting grass and weeds, organizing belongings, throwing out junk, etc).

What to do with build discrepancies and workmanship issues that go unanswered?,"Built a new home in MN, from down payment to ""almost finished"" was about 12 months. ""Almost finished"" means we closed on old house so NEEDED to move into house where finish details were still left unfinished. 

We pointed out all issues during our final walkthrough and added them to the list. More than a month later, still haven't finished a fraction of the list items. 

The main issues that seem like a PITA to properly repair are wood floors cupped or bowed up at the edges,  cracked grout in floor tiles, and changes in the plan that were not signed off on. 

Floor cupping as discussed with a 3rd party flooring company, is unacceptable. Builders performance guidelines say something about not more than 1/16"" while I'm measuring peak to peak at almost 1/8"" across 24"". Builder says wait it out with humidity. Flooring company could possibly just want us to hire them to redo the floor so I'm taking their word with a tbsp of salt. 

Cracked grout is between every 2 or 3 tiles along the short end. 

 Garage was supposed to be a certain height for a car lift but it ended up being 6"" shorter than plan. On top of that, the garage foundation/wall was extended up an extra 3'. 

I'm tired of bugging the builders about all of these issues and only getting ""we're working on it"" responses. 

My fear going into this was that signing on the dotted line at closing meant we're on our own.

Flight Fares Driving Me Nuts – Is There Any Real Price Protection?,"Hey folks, I’ve been trying to book a flight from SFO to PVR and, man, these fares are all over the place. One day they’re sky-high, the next they’ve plummeted. United seems to be at the helm of this madness.

I’ve even seen next-day flights drop in price significantly, which is super frustrating because I’m torn—do I grab something “reasonable” now, only to watch it fall by $200 a week later? Should I wait? Am I just doomed to stress-refreshing flight deals?

I vaguely remember some airlines offering price protection, but I can’t recall which ones (or if that’s even still a thing). Maybe third-party sites like Orbitz offer this? Though, my last experience trying to make a claim with one of those price guarantees felt like battling customer service bosses in an endless loop of “please hold.”

So, what’s the best strategy for dealing with these wildly fluctuating fares? And is there any legit price protection out there? Would love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT:**  I just booked a fare and didn't realize that United now has this ""fare lock"" feature where you can lock the fare for - in this case - 3 days - and then opt to buy or not.  Wish I had known about this feature earlier as the prices have been fluctuating wildly by the day.  Well, thanks again, all.",66,12,1275,225,1

We are back from 10 days in the Czech Republic and Austria.  Here is a short list of tips and/or annoyances.,"Both countries use coin op bathrooms (WCs) in the public bathrooms, including the train stations.  So be prepared with some 50 cent (Euro) coins.  It will give you change if you put in one Euro.  I think it will give you change if you put in a 2 Euro coin, but don't count on it.  Czech Republic uses Czech Koronas (sp?).  I don't remember exactly what they charge.  Perhaps 20 CK?

Be prepared if you don't get a luggage locker at the train station.  Sometimes they run out of lockers.  One time there were none available for us.  Other times it was not a problem.

If you have a PIN for your credit card, take it with you.  Multiple times we had trouble getting cash from the ATM.  Maybe it was a machine problem or a card reading problem.

My first purely personal (i.e. not for business) trip internationally.
I loved every single minute of it. From the food to the people, I couldn't make a single complaint. 
There were some instances of minor culture shock (e.g. paid public bathrooms, paying for tap water and seating yourself at restaurants) but they were really just interesting little differences. 
I rented a car in lieu of taking public transportation, and have no regrets. Driving was fun (if a bit tight in towns and cities) and allowed me to see many smaller, less accessible destinations. It was great having the option of public transportation, though, and I made use of it often (within bigger cities, or if I planned to drink alcohol). 
I tried my best to speak some German, but everyone was very understanding when I couldn't hold a full conversation (and, of course, the majority spoke English just fine, and would switch over when I said ""entschuldigung, ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch"").
I wasn't sure what to expect but I had the time of my life.",59,11,1404,213,1

How did I do? Be brutally honest ,"Let me preface this by saying I’m a total newbie  so there will probably be some wtf moments. I just want to learn more and get it from a experienced persons POV. I want to be able to teach my kid about this stuff later on. 

Brand new development by medium sized builder. Joined their early bird list and went to their open house. They registered me as soon as I walked in. If I wanted to use my own realtor, should he/she been there with me at that first open house? Also, early bird special is first two buyers get a free basement room, valued at 20k. 

Fast forward a week and we are now at our one on one appointment with the sales rep on Monday. We go thru lot selection and sales rep crosses out 2 lots and I’m thinking ‘no more free rec room…great’ BUT sales rep surprises us and says management is willing to give out one more (looking back, I’m thinking all the early buyers got it, what do you think?) 
Anyways, build the house together and come up with a price(we pretty much maxed out the house sq-ft wise i.e. finished basement, bigger kitchen) We try to negotiate the price but to no avail. We say yes and leave. 

Sales rep sends email that night with written contract and wants to schedule signing the next day. I’m shittin my pants. Being a newbie, I did not know it would move this fast, we weren’t even sure if we wanted everything we added. I email my honest feelings about not being ready to sign due to price. I continue to negotiate price over the next couple days resulting in sales rep giving me 10k off sales price. I counter with 20k. Ultimately, sales rep says that would be an offer from me, but given my strong credit and assets, it will more than likely get approved as long we sign on Friday. 
(At this point I already talked to the preferred lender and sent all docs in regard to loan pre-approval. Im guessing loan officer talked to sales rep)

After hearing this, we go sign on Thursday. 
(This is giving me anxiety because this feels like a wink wink deal that has not been officially approved by management. Sales rep keeps reassuring me that it will go thru due to the strong relationship that the manager has with the ultimate decision maker on this. Any chance I get screwed on this?)

(Also, sales rep wrote and sent contract on Monday night, is that considered first day of contract, even though I did not sign until Thrusday? I thought Thursday would be considered first day) 

Ultimately, that will be 40k off price if everything goes smoothly. 
What are the chances of doing better than that? 
Was I out of line anywhere in this process? 
What would you have done differently?
How did I do?

Next thing is design center, will I be able to negotiate price there? If so, tips and tricks please!

16hr layover in Dublin Ireland - need recommendations/suggestions/opinion,"My family and I have a 16hr layover in Dublin and would like to make the best out of it. We will be looking to do the Guinness Storehouse tour.

We're arriving at DUB at 2pm.

Here are some of the general thought processes:

1. It will take about an hr to get through the airport (leave by 3pm)
2. Head to *a hotel* (thinking about one that does airport shuttle due to time constraints) and drop our stuff off
3. Get transportation to get to the Guinness storehouse for no later than the last tour (5pm)
4. Do whatever after
5. Head to the hotel, sleep, head to the airport by 5am for our 7am flight

I'm looking for some opinions/input:

1. Will it take an hr to get through immigration and out the airport?

2. Recommendations for hotels with airport shuttle services. When I google it, I'm get a mixture of ones that provide airport shuttle and ones that don't. I'm getting a little frustrated. 

I'm looking for a hotel between DUB airport and the Guiness Storehouse so we can get to the Storehouse in time.

*in the event that we can't find a hotel with shuttle service, is uber/freenow/bolt readily available for us to get to the airport in time? Or are there any alternatives to get to the airport for 5am?

3. Is traffic bad between 3-5pm? Just want to know if we're being ambitious in our plans. Google maps says that by car, the distance between the airport and the storehouse is 38mins . So in theory, it shouldn't be more than that if the hotel is along the route.

4. Can someone provide a little bit of clarification regarding Uber in Ireland? Some websites say it is used and other places say use Freenow or Bolt.

5. Are there any other tourist attractions that would be available later in the afternoon besides the pubs?

TIA

1 week mid-December trip: London or Mexico City?,"Hi everyone! I am deciding on taking a trip with my partner this December. We are having trouble deciding between CDMX and London. We are in NYC and in our late 20s. We like the usual with exploring local neighborhoods, great restaurants, museums, coffee, history, bakeries, parks, etc. We are not into nightlife or drinking. Of course, both CDMX and London have all of these in spades, which makes it that much harder to decide. I’ve been to London but when I was a teenager and neither have been to CDMX. We don’t speak Spanish. 

The biggest deciding factors for us are probably the options for day trips/short trips away, weather, crowdedness, and cost. 

- Is the weather that bad in London in December? I know the sun sets around 3-4pm which sounds bad but does it actually feel dead and miserable? I am a bit intrigued just because I feel like regardless London will have a cozy vibe. But the weather and greenery in CDMX seems spectacular. 

- I know food scene seems like it should go easily to CDMX but London’s food scene seems so interesting and diverse. Especially because we are very into pastries and desserts

- How crowded is each city in this time of year (around Dec 13-20)? We would prefer a less touristy time relatively. 

- London seems like there are more neighborhoods to explore for tourists while I sense that the tourist friendly area in CDMX is mostly in Roma Polanco Condesa etc. Does that start to feel like too little for a week?

- Is London that expensive for the USD worth? We are from NYC so we are okay w high prices but would not want to go somewhere that is significantly even more expensive. 

- Lastly, day/side trip options are a factor. We are interested in some English villages or towns (Bath seems lovely) but also all of the nature and Aztec history around CDMX seems so cool. 

Which would you recommend? Thanks!!",48,8,1861,331,1

Should I tweak my New Zealand Itinerary to add 1 night in Hawke's Bay?,"I am planning a return trip to New Zealand's North Island after doing a 2 week trip to the South Island last year. I initially had two nights planned in the Bay of Islands at the beginning, but I scrapped it due to logistics and drive times. I used those two nights to give myself additional nights each in the Coromandel and Rotorua. After reviewing the itinerary again, I am wondering if I can tweak this?

* Preface: As my itinerary indicates, I prefer 2-3 nights in most cities, as it allows me time to see as much as possible without rushing. (Auckland is the exception, since we stayed there 3 nights on the last trip). With that said, I am wondering if there is anything I can add in......
* Should I spend a night in Napier/Hawke's Bay on Tuesday, 3/4? This would split the drive from Taupo to Wellington. My concern: Does it give me enough time in Wellington?
* If so, is it worth only spending one day in Napier/Hawke's Bay? I would love to see Te Mata Peak and the surrounding area.
* Are there any opportunities to tweak anything else? I have looked this over so much my brain is mush.

For those that say Hawke's Bay is worth it, would you recommend I cut a night from Coromandel or Rotorua? Currently, I am leaning on shedding time from Coromandel, as a lot of the accommodation is already booked, given the high season. Any insight/feedback/suggestions is highly appreciated.

Interests:

* Scenic views, beaches/coastline, and mountains.
* Hiking (Intermediate / Moderate preferred)
* Small/medium cities with good cafe/restaurant selection

Upcoming Military Move: Sell House or Rent? Low int. rate.,"First post here, bought a house with my spouse in late 2020 for $330k and interest rate of 2.75%, worth about $380k at the moment with a $1750 monthly payment, house built in 2021. I have new military orders to move from Indiana (current house) to Pennsylvania (going to buy a house there). By the time we move in May 2025, I will have about $295k left on the mortgage, but I really don't want to get rid of this rate, not going to see it again (ever?). But we don't plan to move back to Indiana ever, so we'll never live here again.

This is our first house so I am considering renting it out, but I've never done that before. New house in PA is going to be bigger (growing family), so house will be in the $400-$450k range. I just don't know what to do... do we rent it out? At what point would it not be financially worth to rent it out and just cut loose, and sell? If we sell, at what point do we start contacting an agent and get that process started?

For awareness, I make $145k, max out TSP, spouse makes $110k. Will retire from military at 20 years, 11 years in at the moment.",58,10,1086,211,0
Lake Cottage Red Flags ,"Might be some sour grapes here but bare with me.  We have been saving for a few years for a cottage and finally got there.  We asked for a showing on a small cottage in Michigan and the selling agent said she “she didn’t feel safe” showing us the house.  Weird…but ok.  We are a normal middle aged couple with kids.

She mostly communicated with our realtor via text and email. On waiting for the last counter offer, she said she would get back to us after her pickleball tournament later that day.

Question regarding pre existing fence,"So I have owned my house for about 10 years now and at the back of my yard there’s a vacant lot that’s never been developed.

lead paint ,I am in the beginning phases of looking for a home.  My girlfriend doesn't want any home built before 1970 for fear of lead paint.  I keep telling her that is what a home inspector is for and they will let us know if a home has a lead paint warning or not.  She just wants to eliminate over 2/3s of the homes based on them being built before 1970 and won't even go look at the homes.  I keep telling her new construction can be worse then old construction.  I grew up in a home built in 1920 and my parents don't have a lead warning.  What can I tell her or explain to her to make it get through to her that not all homes built before 1970 have lead paint and she is eliminating majority of the homes for sale in PA. ,11,3,717,152,0
Can realtors force you to do showings as the seller?,"I had my house on the market due to planning for having to sell to move for a job. Things changed, and I will be able to stay in state after all, as I secured another job. I expressed to my real estate agent that I would like her to remove it from the market, as I do not have plans to move now. She had already set up a showing for the following Monday (it was Saturday when this conversation happened). I mentioned she needed to cancel that showing since the listing is coming off market and I won’t be selling after all. She refused the request, and told me it’s illegal to cancel a house showing, that I must comply with every showing request. This sounds like utter BS to me. I’ve never heard of such a thing, the seller having no rights to deny a showing? Especially when it’s coming off market and there’s no potential outlook of an offer being accepted.

I told her it would be a waste of everyone’s time. But she’s standing firm on the showing taking place. I looked through our listing agreement just to be sure, mentions nothing of some weird clause that strips my rights to refuse a showing.

To make things worse, these particular people coming on Monday are giving me bad vibes. They’ve tried to “sneak a peak” at my occupied property at least 3 times already, that I’ve caught. They pull in and try to walk around, and drive off soon as I try to walk up to their truck. Caught them tonight and only got them to stop by blocking the drive to ask why they were trespassing. They said they just wanted to look at it and had a showing Monday. I expressed concern additionally to my agent that I don’t want these people in my house at this point, plus it’s coming off market… didn’t matter to her.

Anyone have any idea what she’s referring to? Can I do anything to actually cancel this showing..?",52,10,1807,338,0
1031 Exchange Tax Straddling,"Simply put...
I sold a property in September 2024 and all funds are currently being held by a Qualified Intermediary for a 1031 Exchange. I understand I'll need to identify like-kind properties within 45 days of closing. This will be done.

My question is, come the 180 days (which will be end of March 2025), if no like kind property is acquired and the 1031 fails, do I have the option to claim the capital gains from this sale on my 2025 taxes? I've recently been made aware of ""tax straddling"" which is when a 1031 crosses over 2 tax years. So if my 1031 fails and it is March 2025, will I have the option to postpone capital gains taxes until my tax filing in 2026? Has anyone done this?

Traveling to Mexico by land,"I am looking for information for my uncle as he travels to Mexico frequently.

Sellers remorse ,"So we bought our house In a super cute neighborhood the people we bought from were so precious and excited  for our growing family. They sent us a letter expressing the love and joy they had in the home. 
Well 4 years later the house is way too much for us it doesn't fit our family the layout actually sucks and made it actually semi hard to sell. The taxes are going up and the traffic due to a massive place of worship is insane. 
So even though we love our neighbors we sell. 
We closed yesterday  and we realized the buyers are making it a rental property!!! 
They are doing a bit of construction adding a bathroom  and using it as an investment. 
I just feel so guilty. I feel bad for my neighbors we came to love. 
Like this neighborhood  was either first owners built in the 50s or 2nd owners young families. 
I just seriously  pray the right person rents it long term and it's a good  fit. 
I know logically  absolutely  nine of this is my concern  but I feel really bad. 

edit
I'm not hating on renters I used to live In government  housing, then rented forever. 
If it wasn't for my husband's credit and down payment I'd never have a house. 
I love the idea of people renting houses to people because both parties win. 
The premise of what I was saying was more about the landlord. 
I hope he does well with it.

How to go about terminating buyers agent contract?,"Back in May, my fiancé and I signed a contract with a buyers agent whom we had met and interviewed. He seemed like a decent agent whom we would like to work with, so we signed a buyers agency contract for 6 months. He was the only person we interviewed and basically started our house searching process as first time home buyers. The contract isn’t due to expire til the end of November. 

After working together, we feel like we’re not compatible in the house search together so want to terminate the contract. The contract states we can terminate “if buyer and broker agree”. Does anyone have any tips for going about “firing” him? I don’t want to burn a bridge if he ends up being a sellers agent on a house we like and I’m too much of a marshmallow that I think my phrasing would be looked upon as an optional termination.

La Paz to Uyuni - Bus or Flight?,"Hello!

I'm a relatively young woman (F26) and I want to find a safe way to go to Uyuni for a day. I will be in La Paz, and I have 3 full days/2 nights to go Uyuni.

I'm considering either to fly to Uyuni and book a day tour to see the salt flats, or take an overnight bus but I have a few concerns with either method:

* Safety: Obviously the primary concern here, I'm not too worried about the airport, but more so being at the bus stop at night time, taxis to get to the bus stop in the evening etc.
* Flight delays: Has anyone done the flight and missed their salt flats tour or just been waiting too long?
* Luggage: Uyuni will be the last thing I do on my trip to South America, and I do presume I will have a decent amount of luggage (nothing too crazy but a regular luggage bag + backpack). I'll be starting in La Paz, and I hope to finish there too. I won't be at the same hotel for start/end but I can contact the hotel to hopefully hold a decent amount of my belongings.
* Time: I'd be nice to have a bit more time in La Paz, unless it is a bit dry and not much to do, I'd probably want a bit more of time there, than Uyuni. Or is it worth taking a flight one day to Uyuni, another to Sucre/Cochabamba, and then back to La Paz?

"Is it worth getting your realtor license to sell your own house to save you thousands of dollars? If yes, why don’t more people do this?","Sorry if this is a dumb question, but as a first-time homeowner who will eventually need to sell it, one thing I’ve been slightly disappointed by is how much money I will end up having to pay to a realtor when it comes time for me to move. While doing some research, though, I learned that I could get my realtor license in Maryland for well under $1K, which means I could easily save over $13K when it comes time for me sell. That got me thinking…why don’t more people try to get their realtor license to sell their home, thus saving a significant amount of money? To me it seems like a no brainer, but it’s also just an idea I came up with today so I haven’t exactly had time to really think about it.

Do people not have the time for school, or the money? Do they prefer the convenience of having a realtor take care of the showings, especially in the case that the seller is geographically separated? Is there any reason I shouldn’t just get my license and try to do it myself? 

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Cash to close Question,"I'm currently in the process of buying my first home in IL, and could use a little reassurance about cash to close.

Originally had agreed to pay $110k, seller concessions of $6300.  My lender gave me a cash to close estimate of $4695.16.  

After the FHA appraisal, the assessment of the home value dropped to $101k (seller bought the home, lived there for 3 months, moved out of state and put it up on the market, so no good comps in the area as I understand it).

After some back and forth, seller is paying realtor fees, but no other concessions (which is fine, we can swing it).

The confusion comes in when the lender gave me a new 'rough' estimate.  Cash to close is now $9276.  When I say rough, he sent me a screen shot of his calculation tool.  He did state that we're still waiting on the new estimates from the title and underwriting, so this is a high estimate. That was 12 days ago at this point, and I still haven't gotten a more formal and complete estimate.

1. I don't understand how, if we didn't have the $6300 in concessions from the first estimate, CtC would be around $10,996, but with a drop of $9k in the home value/loan amount, the new estimate is only a $1720 difference

2. From what I've been researching, average CtC in IL is between 2-6% of purchase, this is more like 9%.

This is definitely my first rodeo, so I'm wondering if that (as of right now) CtC estimate could even be semi-accurate.  

Also, should I prep to get hit with something higher at the closing table? (Read too many horror stories with that being the case)",22,4,1558,288,0

Move or Stay After Age 70,"My partner and I are both retired and have lived in our current home in central Texas since 1986 - new build (partner purchased the home two months before we met).  House is a two story in a fully developed area with no HOA and is in great shape with upgrades over the years.  As a plus we back up to a city park green belt with large oak trees just beyond our fence.  

My dilemma is should we stay here or move to a +55 community about 45 minutes from our current home?   The amenities are outstanding with over 100 clubs, golf, tennis, pools, woodshop, etc.   

Downside to staying is the second story, no amenities, all of our long term friends have either moved or passed away, we are the only house on the street with no children, and now that we have retired we spend way too much time driving to and from the gym and other places for entertainment.  

 Our main concern with moving to the +55 community is they have a very strict HOA that costs $140 per month, after a few visits for a formal tour and open houses the atmosphere seems a bit more conservative than we are used to, after +30 years in one spot we are not looking forward to the selling - buying - moving process, we both feel like first-time home buyers, and while most everything will be within a 10 minute drive that shrink may reduce our world too much.

Financially we are OK as we have always lived lower than our means and invested well.  That being said, we are not the landlord type and if we do this we will sell our current place and buy the new place for cash.  After doing a conservative estimate we will have money left over from the sale without disrupting our investments or cash flow.  

Look forward to feedback from others who made similar decisions and RE professionals who have worked with folks like us.",25,6,1796,346,0

My experience traveling internationally with a drone for the first time.,"I recently (September 2024) traveled to Greece with my new DJI Mini 3 with a short layover in Istanbul, both on the way there and back. I flew on Turkish Airlines. This was not my first time traveling internationally, but it was the first time with that type of equipment and I was utterly stressed out about it. I purchased the drone specifically for said trip. I made the mistake of going down a Reddit rabbit hole and all it did was make me feel more uneasy about it to the extent that I was ready to leave the drone behind. I finally told my wife I am just gonna take my chances and if they take it from me, I'm just going to break all four arms of the drone and call it a loss. My biggest concern was Istanbul because online many comments talked about how strict they are about drones, even when just passing through. Long story short, boy was I wrong about everything. I packed the drone in my carry-on backpack, in the little black shoulder bag the drone came with, with the 3 batteries in the little charging hub in that same little bag. Nobody bothered me. Not one person. No one even asked or inquired about the drone, the batteries, my intentions, nothing. I had absolutely ZERO problems traveling with the drone.

"Overpriced, or is sale history scaring off buyers?","I purchased a house in 2017 for a low price from an aging grand parent. It needed a lot of work.  Due to having to do a land exchange with a rail road company through Covid, it took awhile to formally put the house in my name. Since 2017 I have fully gutted and done a complete remodel of the house, I’ve invested about $150k in the house between the purchase and renovations, and a week ago we put the house on the market for what i think is a competitive price for the location, size and condition of the house. On Zillow there’s been a lot of views and over 50 saves, but only 2 showing requests, one of which cancelled. My realtor thinks that’s an indicator that the asking price is too high. I kind of think it’s because in the tax history inaccurately shows the property assessments lower than actual,  but also it shows the house was last bought in 2022 for $50k, with a current selling price of $280k. I am curious what other realtors think, do you think people are seeing the low tax assessment (off by $60k) and the last “purchase” being for a low price only a few years ago? If so, should that concern be addressed in the listing? Or is no showings always an indicator of priced too high?

help with land boundary issues through title company,"Me and my wife are in the process of purchasing our first home with our closing date just a few weeks away. County records show our land is land locked with no easement ever recorded to use our drive way and our title company has advised they show the same information, and that without a easement they will not give us title insurance for any future lawsuits regarding the boundaries of the property and they would want us to sign a release in order to continue with our purchase absolving them of any legal proceedings we encounter in the future. They also said we could never mortgage the property and can only sale it with a cash sale in the future which is also why they think we should terminate. We contacted the supposed owners of the sellers drive way and they advised us that they do not own it and actually showed us the property lines which are clearly marked with paint on trees showing the drive way is in fact on the sellers property after all. They were kind enough to take their proof to our title company. Now our title company is saying it belongs to a different neighbor and scout data is incorrect but that it still doesn't belong to the seller; even though more than likely it does and the county has just made a mistake. Wouldn't the deed prove the drive way does in fact belong to the seller and why cant the title company verify that way? Based on advise from reddit we are having a survey done and it should be done sometime next week. The title company told us that a survey will be pointless because a surveyor will use the same scout data the county uses which shows the incorrect information; but i am hoping they are incorrect about this and a survey will correct the error and show the land does in fact belong to the seller; especially if a surveyor has access to the actual deed to the sellers property. Can anyone advise if the title company can be wrong about what they are saying and that a surveyor can actually prove that the counties data is simply incorrect and possibly when this happened to get things reported incorrectly? It just feels like the title company isn't being helpful at all in this situation and just trying to say they are right and we are wrong and nothing is going to change it when the neighbor and the seller are all saying the opposite.

We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe).
Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out.
For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.   


 We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in?
We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?  


 **--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.**

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants.
Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.


**--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco)  – Fly to Cusco, Peru.**

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?  

  
**--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).**

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing?
Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.


**--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.**

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.


**--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.**

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example.
We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? 
We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?


**--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.**

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic.
Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

We’re aiming for a balance between adventure and relaxation while being budget-conscious. Also, if anyone has hostel recommendations with private rooms, please let us know! Thanks in advance!",38,6,4368,731,1
Builders warranty,"So I was told my home had a builders warranty that we would get it in the mail two weeks after closing we never did. We'd reach out to the builder to get things fixed and She has stalled by sending people over to take a look and give quotes and then I was told by her workers that she doesn't like to pay them and they were surprised they were being called back. Besides the point instead of dealing with her, I tried calling the home warranty by asking my realtor to send me a copy of it because we never got it. I was told by the home warranty company after calling that there was not one on the home now confronting the builder she said the builder is responsible the first year and after that two years later, the warranty goes into place.

Is there any driving rules in Peru?,"First of all I’m from Europe and in my home country we have to take a dedicated test before we can even drive a car. 

I’m currently in Lima and I use Uber for travel and it seem like there’s no such rules here

Everybody turning from the middle lanes 
Turn signal doesn’t exist 
Only using car horns
Pedestrians don’t have the right of way

Buses are whole different things 
I don’t see exact stops 
Everybody just jumps up and down from the bus, and it’s usually still moving or it’s only stops for a few seconds 
People run after the bus and it stops in the middle of a crossing and basically everywhere.

So it’s pretty interesting to me. I’m bit afraid when I’m walking cross the road but it’s fine xd

The whole city is a bit chaotic, but it has a great vibe.

ISO adult kid family vacation recommendations,"This year our family (2 parents, late 50s-married, and 3 adult children mid-to-late 20s with significant others) all agreed, instead of exchanging gifts this holiday season we would save the money and go on a vacation together late February ‘25.

We’re open to flying and some travel from an airport via rental car to a secondary destination, but would probably stray away from a road-trip. We’ve entertained the idea of renting a large house together or staying in a hotel with separate rooms; really, anything is on the table!

"Cambodia, July 2024 - Magical! ","Visited Cambodia from India with my family for a 12 day vacation. 

Landed in Siem Reap and stayed for 4 days. Saw most of the temples there, including the Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and many more. 

Then went to Battambang via bus, which even though is the second largest city in the country, is ignored by most tourists. Spent a couple of days there and it was wonderful. A lot of culture, some gruesome history (killing caves) and wonderful nature! Watching thousands and thousands of Bats flying out of a cave was a one of a kind travel experience! 

Then took a bus to Phnom Penh, the capital. Spent about 3 days there. Pretty nice! The temples, grand palace and the museums were the highlights. 

Before flying out of Phnom Penh back to India, visited the Koh Rong Sanloem Islands which were so vast and empty! Few tourists and nothing else. Some of the most secluded beaches we've ever been to. 

Overall, one of my favourite travels across 10 countries till now! Hope more people visit this beautiful place. Open to any questions 😊

Can I safely buy land that property taxes are owed on?,"A guy who we do business with has been letting us (under verbal agreement) lease a small piece of land from him. He now wants to sell us the land. He and my husband have discussed writing up a contract (of course having lawyers look over it) so we can just pay him for the land directly over the course of a few months (it is a low-value property less than 15k and neither one of us wants to go through a bank). The thing is they owe a small amount of about $600 in property taxes (this is in Mississippi)

The guy is in a tight spot, and while I would like to believe he would pay the $600 - how can we be sure if we give him 5 k down that he will use it to take care of the taxes.  I'm just looking for the best way to approach this. Is there a clause or something we can put in the purchase agreement or maybe use an escrow account or something similar?

Financially manipulated or would I have qualified? ,"Hi all. This concern has been weighing on my mental health and kept me in depression for years.

Newly wed couple in California, Dec 2020. wanted to buy house in 2021. father convinced me i wouldn’t qualify, Told me I didn’t have a LLC with consistent income over 2 years. 

He instead convinced me to give him $150k, he bought a 2nd house for $900k in Jan 2021 at a beautiful rate, which is worth over $1.7M now. 

We’re stuck renting, my income dropped since I got obsessed with this issue and lost self esteem being a renter in my line of work. 

Was he right? My info:

2019: $180k. W2 $7k.

2020: $378k. W2 $100k. Rest is S-Corp distribution.

2021: $160k. W2 $100k. Rest is S-Corp distribution.

Had 2 companies, moved clients to 2nd one: 
- company 1 started in Jan 2019, stopped receiving income on Sep 2020. Closed in Dec 2022.
- Company 2 started in March 2020, started receiving income on September 2020.

Credit score: 790. 0 debt. 

Desired house: $850k-$950k. Could put up to 30% down.

Wrong property title ( no CO for 2-family house),"I am buying a 2-family house in NY. Contracts signed and appraisal done.

Now, my attorney said there is no way to turn it into two family house. ( the seller thought it's 2-family ) they have 2 electric meters but the town said that was a mistake and that should have only had one electric meter because it's only one family house) I think the only thing I can do is to back off the deal after 2-3 months of being stuck with that house.

Home insurance premium 70% above estimated - does this seem reasonable?,"We are in the process of buying a house in the Northeast (VHCOL, \~$1M price, not coastal) and recently contacted an insurance broker to provide us with some quotes for home insurance.  The premium in the quote he ended up giving us was $3600 -- almost more than double the $2100 figure that our lender had included as their estimate in our initial loan disclosures.

We understand that home insurance rates generally are going through the roof, especially with the number of storms and hurricanes we are getting.  I guess we just wanted to confirm whether this is a wild premium to be paying or if this is the new normal? And is the insurance premium number in the loan estimates usually this far off?

The house is \~35 years old but very well maintained.  Coverage is HO3 with some additional endorsements and a $2500 deductible (going up to $5000 doesn't change the premium much, we checked).

Inspector and Buyer damaged property ,"Hello,

So I don't have all the details for this story, since this is my mom's home and I'm unfortunately not really knowledgeable in this area. 

We live in ON Canada, and my mom recently agreed on a price with the buyer. Yesterday, the buyers did an inspection of the property with an inspector, and left at 1pm. My mom returned to the home at 4:30pm, and finds that the garage door mechanism has been broken, one of the wall anchors was literally ripped out of wood. 

I wish my mom was there during the inspection, but I don't live with her and sometimes she doesn't ask for other opinions. Or at least have our realtor there or something. This makes me worried that this was a one sided thing where they had power and wanted to somehow lower their offer (which was already 40k under). 

Any thoughts? What does liability look like here? Did we mess up? We have no cameras so we have no evidence they did it, but the bolt is nowhere to be seen and the only way that would happen is if they took it.

Steps already taken: Immediately my mom contacted our agent and she knows about it, the buyers did not message us telling us something was wrong. We're hoping for a response tomorrow. It seems like a simple enough repair I could help with, but obviously if they did it on purpose it would likely be to negotiate on price, and I can't be there until Friday.",37,6,1360,253,0

Water Damage Repair,"Hello, I am posting this question for a friend:

I am looking at a condo where I just got access to the property disclosures which revealed damage and repair from a leak from an upstairs unit into the kitchen about a year ago.  The cabinets were replaced and it looks like they hired large scale drying equipment, and I'm trying to confirm if they replaced any drywall or not.  But what would folks here want to see to be comfortable with the repairs to this? What signs should I or the inspector look for to determine if it was not adequate, and what are the mold risks going forward assuming that the leak has been adequately repaired?

"I need some ""comfort"" advice and some ways to up my travel game","I have been travelling a lot the last few years ( 5 cities in canada, Cuba twice, Italy, Portland/San fransisco, Greece, Germany and this coming april, France) and have learned a LOT about efficientcy in packing, my personal travel style and what I need and dont need when I travel.  I went from needing a checked back for a few days to only needed a back pack and a duffle bag for 2 full weeks. From being shy to do anything, to making crazy itineraries.  However Im at the point I need some advice to up my game and be more comfertable, and be able to do things more efficiently.

Firstly, being comfertable on longish train rides and trans atlantic flights.  I have yet to find a way to get comfortable.  Ive used blankets as back support.  The given pillow, hoodies.  No matter what I do and how i sit I get a rediculosly sore tail bone.  that is even sitting on a super thick memory foam neck pillow and having a blanket supporting my lower back.  Ive asked some people I know and even googled it and I cant find the same problem or solutions.  Other than taking Advil (which im not sure will work) does anyone have any advice on how to get around this?  Trains arent as bad because theyre shorter and you can get up much easier.  But the 7-10 hour plane trips really suck by the end of them.  It gets to the point of severe pain by the time I land and the discomfort lasts for a week, regardless of advil, heat and stretching I do.

Lastly, packing efficiently.  I realize that its kind of pointless to bring a set of clothes for every single day you are on your travels.  My only problem (personally) is that I dont stay on one place long enough, or am at my hotel long enough to hand wash laundry.  I also seem to pick hotels in europe that dont do laundry either ( in my searches this seems a bit hard to find there anyways? )  I want to pack less, yet cant quite figure out a good plan for washing my clothes.  Even if I pack clothes for almost every day I am travelling its inevitable you wear something more than once so I figure why even worry about having so much?",63,13,2078,411,1

Solar info missing during sale ,"First, please don’t give advice on whether or not to assume a solar lease when buying. What’s done is done for me. Second, I plan to contact a real estate attorney on Monday, but I would still love advice or opinions beforehand so I know if I’m missing anything. 

Okay, now that that’s out of the way, onto the issue I need advice for…

We bought a home back in march. The sellers were a nightmare, but that’s another story. When we bought the home, we were told there was a lease on the solar that was installed in the home. We got info for one lease, were told there’s one lease, even the solar company sent us info for one lease. We agreed to take in the lease for numerous reasons, and all that was done before closing. 

It’s now October. Last month, we were informed that the sellers were still being charged by the solar company. We passed along proof that we’ve been paying, contacted the solar company to confirm we were all good, and went along with our day. Then the previous owners sent us another solar lease transfer. We contacted the solar company again and after a bit of back and forth, discovered they actually had TWO leases with the solar panels; one for the solar panels themselves and one for the energy it produced. 

We looked over everything again and confirmed we were never given that information. We told the sellers agent the information we had been given, and told her we wouldn’t be signing the second lease. She insisted that the solar company would give us a discount but we needed to sign the lease over because the previous owners didn’t know they had two leases (no idea how they couldn’t realize that). She said the solar company admitted it was their mistake, but we needed to sign the documents. We reiterated that we would not be doing that as we were informed about this during closing and we weren’t obligated to now. 

Am I correct about this though? We don’t need to take on the additional lease, correct? Could there be legal recourse for us not taking the additional lease? For reference, it would add another $90 to our monthly bill, and the lease we did not take is for the energy, not the panels themselves. 

Appreciate any advice you have! ",31,6,2192,398,0

Looking for advice/recommendations for Europe itinerary ,"Hi all,

I'm planning a trip to Europe for May of next year, where I will be traveling with my parents and sister for about 14 days. The current very rough outline is to fly into Prague, spending several days there and possibly adding day trips to Kutna Hora or other nearby towns.

Are 14 days a viable amount of time for this plan?

In Bali, I find Gili T, Nusa Penida, Ubud and Uluwatu nice but considering I’m only going for a week I would probably leave Gili T and Nusa Penida out. I am considering Bali but it honestly is my last option as how touristy it is kind of turns me off.

In Vietnam, I would really like to visit Hanoi, Da Nang and Hoi an. I am not sure if this is too many places for one week. Phu quoc is also on the list but I’ve heard it is a tourist trap (?)

Thailand. I haven’t really looked at a particular place in Thailand yet but I am considering visiting Thailand as it would be the “best” time to visit.

Does the 5 year rule still apply when you’re paying 80-90% down with cash? Advice on buying or renting temporarily.  ,"I inherited my childhood home (manufactured home on 4.6 acres) when my dad passed away several years ago.

One of 6 people i have booked a flight for with Ryanair won't make it. Do i tell them somehow or is it enough to just not show up? Also how best to bring along medicine injections?,"Hello all,

Most my question is in the title. Essentially i am going on a trip with several family members in 2 weeks. We have booked the flight some time ago, but unfortunately one of my family has broken her leg recently and probably won't be able to come along with us.

I am not salty about the money and don't need a refund here. I just want to know for sure how best to proceed since i am worried we might be stuck waiting for a passenger who is not going to show up or something.

Also another question, if her leg does recover until our trip, she will still need to take some injections daily for another 6 or so weeks. She takes them herself. 

We have already spoken to our doctor about getting a note for them, but i don't know if they need to be in some sort of special packaging or if they have to be checked in or if they can be in cabin luggage etc...

How likely is this?? Is their anything I can do to help avoid this? We live in Arkansas and I'm about 265 and he's 230. I'm only adding our weights because ive seen some people mention that it can be harder on heavier people?? So figured I'd go ahead and say that, along with where we live as to tell what level we are used to being in air wise. 

If you know how to avoid this sickness or you know of other places that are similar we could travel to, please let me know! We were really wanting to do some beautiful trails/hikes, see things we've not seen before and avoid a few places(Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Alabama because we've been to these places or the weather there), escape rooms, possible shopping?, and amazing food and experiences in general. We are BIG nature people. One last thing, we dont want anything with extreme heat. We prefer cooler areas or at least 80 and below type weather. I know it seems broad but this is what we're wanting. Again, we are really wanting Colorado but I just worry about the altitude sickness. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! ",30,4,1732,311,1
Condoized Appraisal Cost,"Just need a sanity check. I'm getting a quote for $2,000 to appraise my property with 3 units on it for a partial release, which seems absurd. SFH appraisals have been around $450 for me before and it's not like this is 4X+ the work.

Realtor Abandoning Contract,"I have a realtor (in the US) who is trying to leave a contract right when a good deal is all worked out to sell a property.
I have no desire to come after her legally (she seems like she's just having a truly hard time right now), but I'm not sure about what to do for selling it now.

I know who the realtor representing the other party is (the property was listed under the old commission agreement where the seller pays the buyer's agent), and the price and terms are already negotiated for the sale, so I'm wondering if there's any downside to using the buyer's agent to work both sides and offering her 1. either exactly the same amount since it's no longer expected for the seller to pay the buyer's agent or 2. the amount she was expecting plus 1% more.
Alternatively, should I just hire a different seller agent and keep the same commission  offer for the buyer's agent?

I don't dabble much in real estate and something like the realtor breaking the contract is something that I have absolutely no experience in or insight on.
If anyone can advise me on this or even some resources to check out, I'd greatly appreciate it.



EDIT: For anyone who finds this in the future with the same question, it looks like terminating the contract (unconditional termination) followed by contacting the buyer's agent directly and offering 1% more was the right answer for me.
I am, obviously, not a lawyer, nor a professional in real estate by any means, and an advisor of mine did caution me to pay extra attention to closing fees in the final contract, but this is a viable option for me.

As stated in the comments, I could've also chosen to pass it along to another agent in her firm, and I'm also aware that I could've picked a different person entirely (without a ""sure"" thing, insomuch as a financial transaction can be a sure thing, I'd have given my contract to my plan B agent that I'd found before I contacted plan A), but in my particular case, it works out well to get a ""bonus"" for the sale.",27,3,2001,361,0

I bought an out of state property 2 months ago and the tenants said they love the place and want to purchase the property from me.

10-15% down.
Does a financial institute have to approve of the terms to make sure the buyer can afford that?

Is a Home expected to be empty to have your FIRST meeting with a Realtor? Helping an Elderly Person,"Hi there,

Like the title says, I'm just looking for a quick clarification. Background: I am assisting an elderly person who is looking to sell their home, and he is under the impression that the house would need to be empty before a realtor even sees it for the first time.

This sounds very incorrect to me? I know most people will have the home empty by the time CLOSING comes up, or even in advance of showings depending on the situation, but when it's just a meeting with the realtor, I would think it would be totally fine if there are still items in the house (including some boxes being packed).

Realtors, what's the expectation?

"2 weeks in India for a wedding in Bangalore, recs for another place to spend 5-6 nights?","Spouse and I will be in India for the last two weeks of December. We're flying in and out of Bangalore and we want to pick one other city/region of India to visit for 5-6 nights. 

We like: 
* food/drink and related experiences - we like everything from fine dining and street food, would love to go to at least one more fancy place, take a cooking class, maybe do a tour (tea?). 
* nature and wildlife / birds - moderate hikes, quiet places without a lot of people, eco-tours, parks, birding.
* High-quality sightseeing/nature/experience tours with a small group (ie a small van)

We'd definitely visit local cultural/religious sites/museums while we're in a place, but they wouldn't be the main draws for us. 

We prefer a relaxed travel style where we play most days by ear, like maybe we'll book a few things like tours/experiences in advance but otherwise we like to sleep in, get up and decide what we'll do that day over breakfast. While sometimes we decide a full packed day is worth it, we often like to go out and do something, come back to the hotel and nap/chill, and go back out for the late afternoon/evening. So we're looking for a home base with lots of options for interesting things to do where it's easy to be a bit spontaneous. 

Right now Goa and Kerala have both piqued our interest for food/nature. Reddit, what would you suggest for us? Specific suggestions on places to stay/things to do would be super welcome. ",88,17,1437,255,1

Taxes on bringing liquor to Canada from Mexico,"It is hard to find an answer online so hopefully someone can provide some insight.

My plan would be to book a quiet &amp; comfy hotel in central Taipei for the first couple days to help me get over the jetlag and then book everything else on the fly, hopefully getting from city to city via train.

Bolivia: will Uyuni tour with transfer suffice for proof of onward travel?,"Im traveling to Bolivia tomorrow from Peru over land, crossing near Puno. U.S.passport.

I printed out the tour itinerary from the agency website and can point to where it mentions the transfer. Will that suffice?

First time home buyer here. I think I screwed up. The seller wanted two extra days to move out after escrow closes and we agreed to allow that for free. So the contract that we signed states that he needs to be out on the 2nd day by 6 pm and at that time we become in possession of the home. From what I’m reading, we should have asked for payment per diem for the 2 days and then made it so there is a deposit held in the escrow until the seller has fully vacated. Is it too late to ask that a funds be held in escrow until the seller fully vacates? We still have 25 days until closing. This little item has been keeping me up at night. I feel like our realtor led us astray. He did say these are super normal and common and go off without a hitch and for me to not worry about it…but naturally I’m worrying about it.

If the seller has not vacated by the second day, I am thinking I could call the local law enforcement to remove him from the property and provide our contract to show that he’s not supposed to be there. 

To also be fair to the seller, he has already started packing his things. But he needs to close on this home to close on the other then move his stuff. I am just worried he’s not out on time or that he damages something on the way out. And maybe this will just be a (hopefully not too expensive) lesson for me.",50,11,1340,268,0

How should I approach this?,My wife and I recently purchased a home in Florida in August of 2023 for 315k.

The balance is around 103k.  The seller is looking for cash flow and offered to reduce the balance owed if we were to come up with the cash to pay him off whatever figure we agree upon.

Some insight and advice into obtaining my mom’s house. ,"Hey everybody, 

Thank you in advance for the help! I, 30, and my girlfriend 26, have two kids and we’re at the point of our relationship and family where we would like to get into a house from our apartment. This doesn’t have to be right now, because the housing market is crazy especially where I’m from in NJ. My mom owns a house one town over and it would truly be perfect for us. She’s looking to move out and downsize and for us, it has enough space for all of us and a fenced in yard for our pup.

Here’s the issue, I’m not incredibly knowledgeable on this, but my mom has two mortgages—one when she got the home and one that my dad and his sister took out years back for some nonsense. There’s a whole family drama story here I’ll leave out. They’ve both passed and now she’s been stuck with both mortgages she tells me. 

I’m wondering what my options are, if any, and what her options are as well. I’m not super knowledgeable on home ownership and have only just started thinking about it so please be kind 😊",55,10,1018,194,0
Location Suggestions: 10 day trip in March with a 23 month old,"My husband and I (31yo) are planning a trip for 10 days in March with our then 23 month old daughter and need some help with location suggestions.

**About us:** We are academics and avid travelers, but mostly within the US since our daughter was born. However, we did spend three weeks in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland earlier this year when our daughter was 13 months old and it was the most amazing trip of our lives! We love traveling with her, she's a super easy kid, and she's been on nearly 30 flights, so she's an old pro- no concerns there. We are based in the central US, with one two hour flight required to reach an international hub. (A note: we fly through space-available travel benefits on a large international carrier, so we have a lot of flexibility in destination and timing built in to our travel approach.)

**About the trip:** We're planning a travel roulette style trip. We want to have a handful of potential destinations selected and decide where we are going the night before we leave, based on the likelihood of all arriving (and returning home) together, with ease. We are spending two weeks in the Caribbean over the holidays and have trips planned to Greece and Paris over the next two years, so we'd like to avoid those places. 

We'd love to go somewhere a little more unique that we wouldn't necessarily pass through on another trip. So anywhere with a major international airport is less interesting to us for this one. I'm angling for another trip to Europe, but we're willing to consider anywhere that is reasonably safe with decent public transit, so we don't have to lug around her carseat! Additionally, we'd like to avoid anywhere where March/spring break is considered peak season.

We have plenty of credit card points for accommodations, so we're not worried about the cost of travel. We love to explore places with interesting historical significance, visit museums, and go hiking/for long nature walks. We also love to eat! We're okay if it's wet, rainy, snowy, or windy.

Locations that we're currently considering: Malta, Morocco, Venice, and Estonia. 

I would love any feedback, location suggestions, or just to hear your favorite places to spend a week! Thanks!!",62,12,2222,376,1

Question about my rights as a seller,"Here is my situation.  We sold/selling a home with farm land.  The home and land are selling separately to the same buyers.  We were offered a total price for both and split the price up on separate contracts for each property.  The offer was for $350,000.  It broke down as $269,000 for the house and $81,000 for the land.  We have a realtor that is handling this for us.  The contracts were signed on 4/28/24 with a closing date of 6/15/24.  The house appraised for $250,000, so we ended up negotiating a lower price for the house.  After a lot of hassle with closing on the house, we finally closed on 6/28/24 with the house.  The land is being financed thru the Farm Service Agency and I know that financing thru them can take some time.  We are now at today's date without closing on the land.  We have been very lenient.  My patience has run thin.

Throughout this process, we have never signed any extension on the original closing date.  The title company paid off both the house and the land with the closing of the house.  This wasn't discussed with us.  Our realtor took her entire commission for both the house and the land out of the closing of the house.  This wasn't discussed with us either.  I asked our realtor why we have never signed an extension on the closing date.  Her response was ""yeah, we should probably do that"".  She sent me documents to sign to extend the date last week, I am not signing them.  The realtor will only give updates when I ask for them.  We were promised that it would close by 9/1/24 and that passed.  We don't live in the area anymore but have been told that the person buying it from us has been on the land without asking for our permission.

FTHB Lender wants structural inspection ,"In need of advice! My husband and I are fthb. We're currently in the underwriting process and projected to close in 3 weeks. We have a conventional loan and are putting 20% down on this house for $245k.
It has an addition to the original structure that consists of a 2 car garage (lengthwise) on the basement level with a sunroom above on the main level that is half the length of the garage below. There's obvious issues in the garage portion that were evident during the first walk through. Vertical and horizontal cracks with inward bowing on one side due to improper drainage and a thick concrete slab patio above pushing everything down. Another issue...for some reason the lower portion of the garage that is not under the sunroom was built on a separately poured slab and is not plumb with the portion under the sunroom. This came up in our inspection of course. We were already keen on just knocking down the exposed portion of garage and fixing whatever was necessary in the portion under the sunroom and our inspector agreed with that as well as the removal of that slab patio. He added that better drainage and a retaining wall on the oppside side would be necessary. We were fine with tackling it, but assumed it would be after closing. It was appraised 2 days ago and now my lender (Rocket) is saying I need a structural inspection with any repairs noted and fixed before closing. My agent and inspector were somewhat surprised. I asked them ""so even if I want to knock it down and the inspector agrees with that and notes that, I'll have to have all that done before closing?"". My agent basically said that's really shitty but it sounds like it. For context, the sellers are an old couple who were in a rush to leave when we first saw it and actually moved out a couple days ago, probably right before the appraiser showed up. They were really unwilling to budge on the price. Asking $249,750. After a back and forth they said their bottom dollar was 242k. We went in with 245k because there was another interested party putting an offer in. They were also pretty dead set on not paying any of our closing costs. It's also an ""as is"" deal. I get the vibe they don't even have the funds to adresses the issues if we even asked. 
Interesting side note. Another person put an offer in about a month before us and startedgoing through the process, but backed out after their inspection because they weren't interested in dealing with the issues. The old couple apparently fixed up to move out then too and had to come back when the whole thing fell through. At this point I assume they're just unwilling to budge on price and are just waiting for someone to come along who has a lazy appraiser who doesn't bother to look too closely. Other than this issue, it checks almost all our boxes. Should we back out? I have a large inheritance 400k+, but it is hard to access because everything has to be done through my aunt who is the trustee, and lives 4 hours away. I got some money out of an inherited IRA, but it was like pulling teeth to get the whole transaction done. (Rocket is still asking for additional documents regarding that) What are our options at this point? I assume the structural inspector is going to note all these issues and rocket is going to demand it be fixed or won't let us close. Any suggestions are helpful and appreciated. Thank you.

Asked to pay for stained sheets by the hotel,"Hello, I spent 2 nights in a hotel in Thailand, and had a nose bleed during the night, which left 2 stains of blood on the sheets. The hotel is asking me to pay the equivalent of 70$ for housecleaning, which is way more than I paid for the room for 2 nights…. 

I obviously don’t want to pay, because blood stains can be washed and the sheets already had some stains (small but still) and I think the price is insane. It’s also not specified anywhere in the room the cost of any of the items if they were to replace them.

My strategy is to go tell them I’m not gonna pay for stains that can be washed and definitely not that much. The main issue is I have my passeport as deposit (I know stupid) so probably I’ll have to pay hopefully I can negotiate.

"""Points are a scam."" No, they're not.","I've seen this idea a few times on a couple of threads today, so I figured I'd make a post about it, to start a discussion on this, and hopefully learn some things myself. 

There seems to be this idea that buying points is a bad thing. People have posted their closing costs, and that line about points seems to get some folks fired up. A few choice phrases I've seen:

* Points are a scam.
* Points are for those who don't know how to properly shop for a mortgage
* If a bank/broker are offering points it's because it's always in their favor
* Don't pay points. Just don't do it. Use a local lender instead.

This is not right at all (that last line really confused me, what do the points have to do with the institution?). While buying points does incur an upfront cost, in many situations this can be helpful. First, lets talk about what points are. When it comes down to it:

**Points are a bribe you give to the bank for a lower interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage.**

That's it. Lets look at a scenario:

I'm a buyer, I want to buy my forever home, I have good credit, and no current debt. I have $100,000 of my savings earmarked for a down payment, but I'd like to keep some of it for furniture, upgrades, etc. I found a house I love, they accepted my offer of $400k. Now, I go down to my local community bank -- they offer great interest rates, no fees, and they're friendly and knowledgeable, far more than the big online boys. 

I tell the loan officer I have 20% down - 80k, and I'm looking to borrow 320k at a fixed rate, over 30 years. He tells me my credit is great, and he can get me a 5% rate, and shows me a amortizing schedule, summarized as follows:


Desc | Amt 
---|---
Loan Amount | $320,000
Interest Rate | 5%
Term | 30 Years (360 Payments)
APR | 5%
Monthly Payment (P&amp;I) | $1,717.83

 It then goes on to show me how much I'll pay on every payment, what portion goes to interest, versus principal all the way through the 360th payment. A bit of math shows:

After year| You will have paid in interest: | In principal:
---|---|---
1	|$15,892.78|$4,721.17
2	|$31,544.02|$9,683.88
3	|$46,941.35|$14,900.50
5	|$76,921.69|$26,148.06
8	|$119,640.86|$45,270.74
15	|$206,437.76|$102,771.49
20	|$254,238.26|$158,040.74
30	|$298,418.51|$320,000.00

So, over the life of this loan, I will have paid nearly $300k in interest, and $320k in principal. I tell the loan officer, that it seems crazy that I'm paying 300k to borrow this. I'm sure I could refinance this later if rates go down, and I suppose that even if this is my forever home, life may have different ideas, and I may sell it before that 30 years, but... lets just assume I plan on keeping it for the foreseeable future and that rates aren't likely to go down in the next 5-10 years.

The loan officer says I can buy points in order to lower that rate. He said, for $3,200, he'd lower the rate by 25 basis points making my interest rate 4.75%. I ask him to show me the numbers again, side by side:

Desc | Loan 1 | Loan 2
---|---|---
Loan Amount | $320,000 | $320,000
Interest Rate | 5% | 4.75%
Points Cost | 0 | $3200
Term | 30 Years | 30 years
APR | 5% | 4.8%
Monthly Payment (P&amp;I) | $1,717.83 | $1,669.27	


Ok, I'm saving $48.56 month-to-month, but was it worth paying $3200 for? It depends. It will take 66 payments (five and a half years), saving $48.56 per payment in order to make up for that. If I keep the house for this long, I'll break even on that points investment.

But what about the whole loan? I will be saving nearly $50 per payment, but what does that equal:

After year| You will have paid in interest Loan 1: | Paid in interest AND points in Loan 2:
---|---|---
1	|$15,892.78|$18,293.42
2	|$31,544.02|$33,147.12
3	|$46,941.35|$47,749.46
5	|$76,921.69|$76,150.65
8	|$119,640.86|$116,542.30
15	|$206,437.76|$198,274.55
20	|$254,238.26|$243,034.25
30	|$298,418.51|$284,137.73

So looking at this, in loan 2 even before I've made my first payment, I'm already out $3200 compared to loan 1. However, the interest savings show that somewhere in year 5, I start saving money compared to loan 1.

By the end of the 30 years, I'll have paid over $14k more in loan 1 versus buying points in loan 2.

The loan officer tells me this is just an example, and I can buy the amount of points I feel comfortable with - he says for every 1% of the loan amount I give him, he will knock .25% off the interest rate. (This will vary from bank-to-bank). 

This is where you compare the APR - this takes into account the cost of the points/fees plus the total amount of interest paid and comes up with an actual rate. In the example above, buying another point for $3200 brings the interest rate from 4.75% to 4.5% and the APR from 4.8% down to 4.67%.

Choosing to buy points and how many points can depend on your situation - do you have enough cash to buy those points, if so are you taking away from your down payment? If you're under but close to a 20% down payment it may be worth skipping the points and hitting that 20% to avoid PMI. 

If you don't know how long you plan to own the place, or if you plan on refinancing soon (rates going down?), or if you'd rather keep your extra money in the market or elsewhere may all impact your decision to buy points and how much to buy. Remember, homeowners stay in a home for eight years on average, and many may refinance before then as well.

To those saying ""it's a scam, it's only benefiting the lender"" - it is true that it is usually in the interest of a lender to sell you points, BUT it's value is as hedge against inflation and the cost of reselling loans - not as a way of sticking it to the borrower, getting more money out of the borrower. All things being equal, over the 30 year loan, a borrower buying points will pay less to the bank than a borrower who didn't buy points.

Please feel free to correct me where I'm wrong, or even tell me if I'm flat out bonkers.

p.s. somewhat unrelated, but another myth to be busted: banks don't ""Frontload interest in a mortgage"" as a way of sticking it to borrowers either - it's just the way amortization works. You have a big balance at the beginning of the loan, you pay interest as a percentage of the balance. As the balance decreases, so does the interest amount.

**tldr:** In conclusion, points are a tool, not a scam. Points lower your interest rate and monthly payments and you (hopefully) own the property long enough for the savings to cover cost of those points. Balancing how many points versus how long you plan on owning the property is key.

Has anyone from outside Germany ever processed a paper DB (Deutsche Bahn) compensation claim?,"So long story short DB owes me some €300 (cancelled trains and overnight stranding). It's been 2 months and all that has happened so far is this:

* NS International (Netherlands), the ticket seller, refuses to compensate, refers me to DB (the operator)
* DB has informed me the only way to do this is to send in a paper claim with all the evidence
* I send this via registered post, but it comes back 3 days later as undeliverable, because the address DB provides everywhere is:

[DB Dialog GmbH, Servicecenter Fahrgastrechte, 60647 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.](https://int.bahn.de/en/help/contact/passengers-rights-claim-form)

Notice how there is no street name or number. I can't even try another provider like DHL because they won't make a label without the street name + number in Germany. I literally cannot find a physical postal address to send something to.

I called Deutsche Bahn, who do not work in English (though when *selling* tickets they are more than happy to work with you in English), and they hung up on me. So now I don't know what to do other than spend a whole day taking a train to the nearest German city to drop this off at a train station where they will apparently take care of it.

Lots of times I see posts on here of travelers unable to claim their compensation because they don't have an IBAN. But I live in the Netherlands and I do have one, I just can't seem to post the letter.

The entire process feels very ""on purpose""; the last time a Eurostar was merely delayed (didn't strand us), the compensation claim was automatic: no intervention on my behalf at all. Possibly a different scenario but I cannot see how forcing people to use mail and then not even providing a valid address is tolerated.

  
Edit: basic details, per the auto comment  
Train was 4 August 2024 from Munich to Hanover, Hanover to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Zaandam. First train became so late we missed the connection at Hanover, were told by NS International to take another itinerary 2 hours later and they re-issued tickets for the new itinerary with a connection in Dusseldorf (since we'd then have guaranteed seats; no way I was sitting on the floor all the way to Amsterdam). But then that train was delayed almost 2 hours en route. We checked with the train conductor who said, you need to stay in a hotel, gave us a piece of paper that proved there were ""no further connections to Amsterdam tonight"" from Cologne (nearest city on the train at that point).",93,14,2472,427,1

WNC disaster happened while I’m under contract on two houses (selling one and buying the other),"So I am in an area (Western NC) with massive devastation after the hurricane. I had just put my house under contract and signed a contract to buy another in the same area.

 My house did great, no damage. It’s actually very prepared because of my planning with a generator hookup and everything. (I’m running the whole house off my generator now). 

The house I am going to buy is 50 years old and I had planned to remodel some. It also did not sustain damage, but lost all the trees blocking it from a busy rural highway it overlooks, so less desirable. Also, in my inspection of the home I’m purchasing (had it done the day before the storm) quite a few issues came up including moisture. So I’m still waiting on an appraisal and I won’t be able to get anyone to give quotes on the issues because companies will be too busy after the storm (I do have a good idea on most cost except a few big ones). I still can’t drive to it because of down trees and no one is even airing it and it has no power still. My inspection period ends in 2 weeks. 

So, on the house I’m buying I was going to try to get the owners to come down on cost because of these issues before the storm. I was just going to get more information on the issues and appraisal before negotiating. So now I am wondering if I can’t get them to come down what kind of a housing market am I going to have to deal with? I know there will be a shortage, but how will that affect prices? I’m just worried I’m about to be homeless. 

Edit- my real question is what will this do to the real estate market? Immediately and over a little time. I am concerned the owners may not negotiate with me and I can’t walk into a money pit blind (the disaster won’t leave me with time to investigate further either and I think will leave very little rentals). But- A money pit house seems worse long term than being homeless/couch surfing awhile. ",95,16,1892,365,0

Madeira or Azores (sao Miguel),"Hi Reddit! 
Looking for some insight on where to go in late Dec/early January. Got a group of 8 adults that are an annoyingly difficult mix to plan for.  Half the group can’t swim and want to hike more / adventurous excursions.

* a small cozy town that is great for families (small shops not meant for tourists but more for the locals, coffee shops, basic grocery, restaurants etc)
* super important that small town doesnt mean backwoods trashy redneck town (we are from NC and TN and small town doesnt always mean cute and cozy here), think more cute Hallmark town, I know every place is going to have its ""people"" we just dont want that to be the majority as we have seen and dealt with here
* has a larger town within 20-45 mins drive that has the larger stores
* schools dont matter hugely as we homeschool
* has land in area suitable for small farm w/ livestock (chickens, ducks, goats, etc, nothing crazy)
* no big risk for natural disasters, so no lower coastal states, no obvious tornado states, etc
* mild weather with nothing too crazy for winter and not crazy humid/hot in summer
* low crime rate in and surrounding
* good real estate options, prefer to buy house with land, no time to waste with building
* good medical care within decent driving distance
* Local farmers and crafting markets would be amazing too

My kids are very outdoorsy, fishing, hiking, biking, and I want to do some small homestead farming, nothing crazy, and would LOVE the space for my own ceramics and crafting workshop.

Visiting India as a Dutch National but of Pakistani origin ,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently living in the Netherlands (since past 7 years), and I’ve renounced my Pakistani nationality few years ago. I’ve traveled to about 35 countries across Europe, Asia, and America, and one destination I’ve always wanted to explore is India. I’ve heard so many wonderful things about the cities, culture, and landscapes from my Indian friends here in the Netherlands, which has made me even more eager to visit. I’ve actually wanted to travel to India for quite some time now, to experience everything I’ve heard about firsthand.

I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into how difficult or easy it might be to get a visa for India as someone of Pakistani origin? Are there any specific restrictions or places I might not be able to visit because of my background?

I’m just looking for any helpful information or experiences regarding the visa process and any potential travel limitations. I would really appreciate your advice. I’m approaching this with the utmost respect and a genuine desire to explore and learn.

Thanks so much in advance for your help!

"Custom ""Foreign Tourist Driver"" magnet sticker a bad idea?","I will be going to the US and renting a car. It will be the first time for me to drive on the right so I thought of having a custom ""Foreign Tourist Driver"" magnet sticker made and placed on the rear bumper and rear side doors on both sides. (Its a mouthful I know but ""Foreign Driver"" may imply I am a foreigner residing permanently in the US and ""Tourist Driver"" could imply I'm from another state)

Is this a bad idea? Will it give ideas to opportunistic robbers? My main concern is if I make some mistakes while driving, the sticker would give drivers behind me a hint of caution.

Update: Got it. I think I will use “New Driver” or “Student Driver”. I got the idea for a tourist sticker from a recent practice in Hokkaido, Japan

Selling home and moving to rental as we wait for the next one. Any tips?,"Due to personal reasons, our home purchase didn’t work out for our family of 4.

We’re going to move to a rental (apt or townhouse?) while we wait out the market for our next home to come up in our town.

Should I sell my house in the Florida Panhandle?,"I’m active duty military and will be moving to a different state. I bought my first home with a VA loan back in 2020 with a 30 year 2.5% fixed rate. Unfortunately I have an HOA and it’s been steadily increasing each year same with my insurance. My home is worth approximately 150k more than what I bought it for and I live in a tourist area (Panama City Beach). A majority of the homes in my development are rentals and it isn’t hard to rent out. Currently paying $1650 mortgage including HOA and most houses rent out somewhere between $2000 - $2400. I’m wondering if it’s worth getting a property manager and keeping the home as a source of income or just selling it while I still can. With the weather getting worse each year and the insurance problems and rising HOA fees, I’m thinking the market will correct pretty hard at some point and all the equity I have will greatly decrease.

Intrafamily loan ,"My parents are moving to a senior community, and my wife and I would like to buy their house. They had been advised to sell it to us for fair market value. They do not owe anything on the house, and they don’t need money from us to support them.

We would need a sizable loan to be able to buy their house. My dad is willing to do a family loan and he’s OK with us paying the interest only which would be set at the AFR. But he’s not thrilled about gifting a lot of money, because the potential cost of memory care for my mom is a huge unknown. 

I have one sister who doesn’t want the house, doesn’t need the money, and my dad doesn’t feel like the value of the house needs to be split with her at the time of inheritance. Currently, my parents will are set up so that the entire estate is split evenly. Dad said that if we do this, all of the interest payments we make on the house should revert back to me.

So my questions are:

1. If Dad does gift to me (up to the $18k annual Lyne for reporting ) and that money is applied to the principal, then it stays with him and he can use it whenever he needs to for mom‘s care, right? Meanwhile, the principal gets reduced each year, so the loan would be paid off in X years, hopefully before the time of inheritance.

2 a. If there is no gifting and we’re paying him interest only, we would still owe the entire principal to the estate at the end of the loan term. So should we set the term to 30 years since we know this will take us past the time of inheritance, and then I could use my inheritance to pay off the estate?

2 b. Or should we set this up as a 9 year loan to get the lower AFR? Then after 9 years, could we refinance with him with the same terms, and keep doing that every nine 9 until the time of inheritance? 

3. If I’m using my inheritance to pay off the loan, that basically means I’m paying half of that to my sister. My dad doesn’t want that, so should the loan agreement include forgiveness upon my parents deaths?",17,3,1986,392,0
Review my family’s Europe holiday trip!,"My (30F) family (parents, sister, and my husband) are taking a family trip to Europe over the holidays. Please take a look at our itinerary and feel free to offer and feedback.

Are there any other cities that we should consider outside of Budapest? We’re interested in seeing a town with Christmas markets and some initial research suggested that there were some good ones in Budapest. But this is not a trip dedicated to seeing them. We are set on Rome at this point but open to hearing other suggestions - particularly if Venice is best seen during other seasons. I think we’d prefer to keep this trip pretty touristy as my parents prefer site seeing popular destinations and we’ll keep the more in depth travel experiences for separate trips. Greece, Portugal and Spain are not options as atleast one of us has done one or more of those within the last year. 

How does the length of time look for each city? We are fine with being on the go and spending the days sight seeing. We are also open to adding maybe one more city even if it’s for 2 days. Originally, I had baked in Florence but I’d prefer to spend a longer trip there and really enjoy the art (my family is not into art). 

Any other suggestions or commentary are welcome!!

After I signed on a home my realtor said the sellers ex wife won’t sign😮😞,"I negotiated, I paid for appraisals and inspections, they cleaned everything out, I did a final walk through. I signed all the forms. The title company even took my picture with a big dumb key in my hand.


My realtor called me up : hours later and said don’t move in the ex wife won’t sign the necessary forms to sell . She’s not on the deed. It’s just a divorce decree that says she’s entitled to half the profits. 

The story is that she cheated on her husband and then let her friends live in the house for free. Her friend’s trashed the place which devalued the house enough to where there is no profit. The husband is the only one on the deed. He gets sick of everything and just sells it for what ever he owes probably so he could just mess with her friends? I don’t know? It appraised at a low value 

So she walks into the title company and they give her paperwork to sign off on. She says , “how much do I get” they say, “nothing” . She walks out.

I get no house. What the hell?

It’s an 800sq ft, 2bedroom 1 bath from 1920 on .17 acre that has no foundation underneath it.  After walking through the house, its condition is in between being a teardown or a massive fixer-upper. $165k for a fixer-upper is a fair price, but $165k for a teardown is far too much. 

How much is a fair price to pay for it if it is a tear down?

This is my first house I’d be buying, and we’d be living next door and renovating it ourselves until we could rent it out. 

Any advice or things to look for to help decipher whether it’s a tear down or fixer upper? Worried the banks won’t approve of a mortgage for it either way due to condition. 

Things that may make it a tear down:
- no foundation, very shottily supported by cinder blocks, jacks and rocks.
-the house has settled and some rooms have a slope in the floor of about 2 inches
-the kitchen and bathroom need to be completely gutted
-there is a hole in the laundry room floor due to rot
-Will need a new roof soon, it is bowing
-all floors need to be replaced 
-needs 4 new propane heaters
-needs new back deck, it is rotted

Can't get 3 month supply of diabetes injection for my trip. Is it possible to get a 1 month supply in Sweden?,"I'm going on my sweden trip on october 22nd. Unfortunately the only pharmacy that allows 3 month supply store pick up is CVS. No mail order pharmacy accepts my medicine now. And the 3 CVS pharmacies I called either have 1 or 0 of it.

How to salvage a curtailed vacation ,"Say your vacation’s tomorrow, everything’s booked, you’ve checked in, you’re packing. Then domestic disaster strikes and you can’t go. 

A few days later, the problem is fixed. With a few tweaks, it’s still possible to go on the second half of the vacation. But booking new outbound flights at such notice is very expensive. The cost can be afforded, but not comfortably. 

What would you do?

A) Pay up and go. Even though you’re paying a lot more than originally intended, at least you still get a vacation out of it

B) Cut your losses and accept the cancellation of the trip. Hundreds of dollars have been lost on non-refundable flights and accommodation, with nothing to show for it, but at least you’ll effectively reclaim some of it through saved expenditure on meals and attractions whilst out there",36,7,807,136,1

Help determining home financing amortization schedule,"Most online mortgage calculators simply don't work for our situation. Hoping someone can help me double check my math.

We sold a property in North Carolina in June of 2020, with owner financing of $196,000 with 3% interest. The Buyer paid $1000 per month for the first 13 payments (from June, 2020 to June, 2021) and has been paying $5000 per month since.

According to one online mortgage calculator, Buyer will pay $5,000 for September and then make last payment of $4083.22 for October.

Looking for a creative way to approach a landlord to sell,"**Background:**  Ive lived in this house with my gf since 2013.  The house is nice and the rent has always been cheap.  The home owner was a young man when he bought this house for $240,000.  He only lived init for a year, but then left to go to school and work on the east coast.  He is 15+ years older now and has a wife and kids.  However, I have never spoke with him.  His Asian mother handles the rental property business.  The utilities have been in his name the entire time, which may be his mothers way of keeping his state residency.  His mother believes he will eventually move back to the area and live in this house.  I believe that is unlikely.  

The houses in this neighborhood in this style, that have had improvements, can sell for 1.2 M.  However, the landlord has not put in any upkeep the entire time (and likely before) I have lived here.  The roof is original and is 40 years old, there are plumbing leaks, a hole in the roof caused leakage into the wall.  I repaired the hole, so the damage has been halted, but is still there.  A first floor bedroom has a large hole in the ceiling.  We recently paid for a home inspection to outline the existing issues.  

What we would like to do is to buy this house.  **The question is how can we go about approaching and convincing the owner(s) that selling to us is a good idea**.  

The mother wants her son to move back across the country.  This isn't likely to happen (but you never know), as the wife's family is near where they currently live.  We have only ever communicated with the mother.  I have recently dropped in conversation that we would be interested in buyjng this house.  I believe that she wouldn't mention it to him. 

**The Ask:**   Chess is a fantastic game.  Small strategic moves can accumulate and yield incredible victories if done right.  I am looking for advice on how to properly approach the home owners.  They are Asian.  (This matters because cultural sensitivities and etiquette should be considered)

**The Approach:**  The condition of the house is not ideal for anyone new moving back in.  A large amount of money would need to be invested to bring it up to code, as well as the be appropriate for a new tenant.  If we were to offer them say, $1M for this house as is... they could invest that money.  Put it somewhere to sit and grow until he was ready to come back to this area.  At that time he could buy something new.  

I have never lived anywhere as long as I have here.  I would really like to make this my forever home.  Buy it, build it up and settle here.  

  
I'm looking for any advice.

Hertz is trying to charge me for damage to the car pls give me advice ,"We returned the car with no damages and the agent that checked our car verbally stated that there were no damages. The gas lid that is on the outside of the car with the paint fell off on the first refueling of the car when I tried to open it by pushing and it just came off with my hand. It was completely undamaged at return and the agent said it was no problem and he tried to reattach it himself but there was a crunch sound and he snapped something. He then said that he would have to send it to the shop so they can re attach it and reassured me that there would be no charges whatsoever. Once again if you note the areas of damage in the report there is nothing that says damage just assessment to the gas lid which in the picture is right next to it. If the gas lid was damaged it was done by the agent. 

I never received an email about the damages and deleted any pictures and videos I had about the car to save storage on my phone. I only received a letter which I didn’t see until I returned from travels. It is wrong that I was not sent an email as soon as this was billed and only got a physical mail that I didn’t see for another month. 

there has to be security camera footage of my return date at the time that I signed the document showing that I explained it to the agent and that he himself tried to reattach it and damaged it right? He was reassuring me that no fees would be charged and no damage was done and that they just needed to reattach it. 

The agent verbally lied to me if there are fees I have to pay and it is not right. I’m trying to dispute it any advice? They are trying to get me to pay for the total replacement of the gas lid ",70,16,1667,338,1

"Unable to sell my house, what am I doing wrong? - need suggestions/tips","hi guys. as the title says, i've been failing to sell my house since quite some time now. Our family used to live there during my childhood and then we moved out 18 years ago. I think the time is right to sell it off but I have been failing to do so. I need some suggestions or tips on it please.

1. The property is 125 sq yards. It has a ground floor + 3 floors above it. The ground floor also has a showroom, making it somewhat a commercial residence, as it is open from both front and back sides (idk if commercial residence is the right term)

2. The property is located at a lower/lower-middle class area. 

3. The property is quite old. It was constructed during the 1990s. 

4. The price tag on the property that was set by one of my family members was 35 million (in my currency which is PKR). 

My concern is that the price tag is a bit too high, considering the area where the house is located. But, at the same time, the commercial showroom on the ground floor can bring in good opportunities for someone who'd want to rent it or start something. I have tried newspaper advertising, uploaded on social media and even spread word around the area it is in. But, still unlucky.

Excellent food, historical sites, and scenery. The market there at the moment is currently very focused on the domestic market, which makes sense when there is such huge domestic demand and a lack of English proficiency. As population decline hits China and it becomes more willing to accept foreign tourists, I presume it could become a huge market.

Before we had a video tour with the parents, we had been thinking $280k but felt like it was hard to justify without much reason to really pull it down.

New Build Flood Zone,"My wife and I are in the market to buy our first home. We’ve looked at a few and really like the idea of a new build presale. We found one we really like on a lot we really like. It is .91 acres.

They have made a retaining pond with channels and ensure us that FEMA is to come out soon to reevaluate their engineering work and remove the flood zone.

We submitted a contract with the contention that the entire lot is removed from the flood plain which we assumed wouldn’t be an issue since they have already done the dirt work and it’s just a matter of FEMA coming out. They rejected and countered saying the Lot should be removed but right now they can only give proof that the actual structure of the house would not be in flood zone. 

We don’t really feel entirely comfortable. Although it isn’t a huge deal that the end of the lot would be in flood zone and we probably wouldn’t have to buy flood insurance it worries us to take their word for it. I’m not as worried about flood insurance as I am worried about resale value. If we are this cautious of it, odds are the next buyers would be too in the off chance that FEMA designates it still in Flood zone",20,4,1311,258,0
Romantic 10 Year Anniversary Weekend-Short flight from LAX/Long Beach ,"We are celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary in early November and going away for two nights which we have not done in at least 5 years (6 year old and 3 year old at home).

Looking for:

-Shortish flight from LAX or Long Beach

-Shortish drive to destination from airport

-Spa

-Great food

I don't drink so wine tasting wouldn't really be on the itinerary but I do think the scenery is beautiful.  Love nature, forest, ocean.  We live by the ocean so it's not a must.

Only have two nights so really trying to make the most out of it while experiencing somewhere new together!  We've gone to so many places in Southern California, got married in Palm Springs, visited Seattle.  

Thank you so much for any recommendations!  I'm overjoyed with the thought of finally getting away with my husband and just want it to be a special trip!!",70,10,843,149,1
Should I check into a mistakenly booked flight?,"I mistakenly booked a flight from Madrid to Venice via air europa and I have no option of a refund.

Just bought an apartment - what should I inspect first before starting renovation?,"I recently bought my first apartment, which I managed to snag at a pretty great deal, partly due to some savings and a bit of luck on a sports bet of $1200 on Stake that helped push me over the finish line. Now that the excitement of buying has worn off and I’m starting to settle in, I’m realizing that there might be some hidden issues that didn’t come up during the initial walkthrough. I’m wondering if I should do a more thorough inspection before I get too comfortable.

I’ve watched a lot of videos where people talk about issues that didn’t show up in the basic inspection reports, and I want to make sure I cover all my bases. Things like plumbing, electrical systems, and even foundation problems can turn into huge financial burdens if they aren’t caught early. I’ve been trying to educate myself on what to look for, but it feels a little overwhelming knowing where to start. I also want to make sure the apartment's in solid shape before I invest in any renovations or upgrades.

For those of you who’ve gone through this process before, what should I be focusing on first? Are there any specific areas that tend to get overlooked in typical inspections that I should check? Any advice on how to avoid potential costly repairs down the road would be much appreciated. I want to make sure my new place stays a great investment without unexpected headaches.",82,13,1368,243,0
Seller asking to extend closing date (CA),"We went into escrow with a 60 day close. Two weeks ago the sellers found a home to buy and asked if we wanted to close early and we agreed. We gave notice at the house we are currently renting and landlord already found a new tenant. We are due to close in two weeks. 

Just received a call from our broker that the sellers deal fell through and they want to extend closing date another 30 days.

Spoke to our landlord and they’re already rented our house out. This means if we were to accommodate them we’d have to move out, put our belongings into storage and stay in a hotel, then pay movers a second time to move us back in. 

Our rate lock will have expired by then as well. All contingencies have been signed at this point.

New roof vs repair before selling in Miami,"Looking to sell my home in Miami . It will go for around $1.1 million. The roof is 25 and has some leaks that need to be addressed. Repair quotes are in the $7000 range. Replacement quotes are in the $26000 range. 

My thoughts are, the replacement will increase the buyer pool, more offers would mean a chance of a higher offer than if I went the repair route. 

If I go the repair route I’ve been told by my insurer if it passes inspection it will be insurable even at 25 years old (he said tile roofs up to 40 get insured). 

My thought is that worst case scenario I’m out $19k if I replace instead of repair and don’t see any increase in sale price with the new roof. But, reduced the chance that a sale falls apart because the roof is old. Basically I need to estimate the likelihood and amount of any negotiated price reduction due to the age of the roof. 

Curious if I am missing anything important here. 

Edit! Forgot to ask, is it reasonable to list the house before the roof replacement is complete? Work would be done end of November according to my roofer. I’d like to sell soon for personal reasons. ",42,8,1115,211,0

Millionaire Home Renters: The Start of a Multi-Income Bracket Trend,"There have been several perspectives on renting vs buying lately, where the pervasive thoughts are that renters are not financially able to afford buying, or that they are generally on the lower income ladder, so renting is all they can do.

This article is one of several that have started popping up lately. Are we seeing a trend shift as a society? Just a fad? Complete nonsense?

Did we get screwed over by our hotel in Barcelona?,"We did a tour in Spain with additional hotel stays, our Madrid hotel experience was flawless, they provided a lot of services for us for no extra charge like getting us tickets to museums, but in Barcelona we felt we were getting constantly screwed over. They charged us a tax first thing, which I guess is a thing there, they also charged us to hold our luggage since we got to the room too early. We didn't have any of these charges in Madrid.

The biggest one is we asked the hotel to call a taxi because we couldn't see any outside the hotel. Everyone told us we could do this so we assumed it was not a problem. We told the front desk to schedule a taxi to the airport 30 minutes from now so we could go up and finish packing. When we arrived at the airport the price was really high, like double or more what it should have been for a 20 min trip. Turns out the front desk didn't schedule the taxi in 30 minutes, but told the taxi to be there right away, so we got charged for 30 minutes of waiting. The taxi driver also told us there was a fee from the hotel for calling the taxi, which they didn't tell us about. We couldn't really do anything to dispute the bill so we just paid and left.

Is this a normal thing that we just weren't aware of? Or was the hotel screwing us over? I find it hard to believe because they were so nice and asked us to leave a review.",50,10,1371,270,1

[FL] Buyer wants to close as soon as possible and let sellers stay in until originally agreed upon closing date. Any drawbacks for the seller?,"Appraisal came back already so at this point it's just the waiting part. Original escrow timeframe was 30 days but the buyer is wanting to close up to 10 days earlier if possible. We said we can't do it (finishing up medical stuff and dates for work PTO and moving truck are already locked in). 

They came back asking if we could close early still but allow us free post occupancy through original closing date while funds are just held in escrow until then (or if we leave sooner). 

I'm looking for thoughts on pros and cons with this. I'm leaning on just leaving everything as originally agreed upon to keep complications to a minimum. I'm the main one dealing with everything and also the one wrapping up with a (minor) medical procedure so just feel like this is more mental effort than necessary before a cross country move.",142,25,831,149,0

Traveling Abroad and Health Care When Retired?,"Hi all,

  
In retirement planning, my wife and I want to continue to travel, but I have had recent realizations making me really think of how to do that once we're retired. We live in the USA. My worry is the realization that Medicare doesn't cover you if you're traveling to places like Europe or Asia. But at that age, it seems like a chance of an ER visit may be greater. Like if I'm 70 and had a heart attack, do you just screw yourself for the rest of your retirement? My current insurance provides health care abroad, but I'd hate to work to my death just for the health care. I'd also hate to not travel just for the chance I might have an ER visit. Do you just buy travel insurance for the trip to cover that? I've seen things like Faye but then I also read that they can be a pain to deal with and not pay out. thanks for any insight you all can provide. I've got a long time (25+ years) until I retire so this could be a completely different thing by then, but trying to be ahead of the game.",46,7,1003,200,1

Visiting Miami from Ireland at the End of October – Any Tips/Suggestions for My 6-Day Itinerary?,"\*\*Dia duit mo chairde!\*\* (That's ""Hello my friends!"" in Irish)

As the title suggests, I will visit your fine city at the end of October. I'm really looking forward to the trip as it will be my first time in Miami, albeit I've been to Florida (Daytona, Tampa and Orlando) when I was younger.

Although there's a small group of us travelling, we each arrive on different days, which has given me plenty of time in advance to draw up a plan of things I'd like to see and do. I've also booked some activities in advance.

If you'd be so kind, I'd like the people of this subreddit to review my itinerary, offer some suggestions of things I should add or remove, provide some general advice about the city and overall, provide some constructive feedback. This trip wasn't cheap, and Miami is a city I've always wanted to see, so I want to ensure it goes as well as possible! The primary reason I'm travelling is to see my favourite NFL team (The Arizona Cardinals) take on your Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.

I've reviewed some tourism posts within this subreddit over the past few months and have also come across some fantastic suggestions from users, so thank you for that!

Below, I'll try and go into as much detail as possible regarding what I plan to do over the six days. Please also forgive me in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors I may have mistyped. I've been reviewing this post for about an hour to make sure it's perfect (This is my third read-through..). Anyway, I hope this post doesn't end up too long, boring or deleted by the Mods. So without further ado, please see below:

# Day 1 - Coral Gables

I arrive at Miami International Airport at 5:30 PM and will have to go through immigration. I hope this doesn't take too long! From there, I plan to take an Uber or Lyft to my accommodation. This should only take about 15-20 minutes according to Google Maps.

Once checked into my hotel in West Flagler, the plan is to take an Uber or Lyft to the Coral Gables area to explore some bars. Clubbing isn't my scene, so dive bars where I can watch sports and talk to people are right up my street. (Is this called a 'Dive bar?')

I'm going to a bar called... ""The Bar"" followed by John Martin's Irish bar. If I have the time, I might go to Tap42 bar. I also think I'll stick to bottles of beer while in Miami, as I don't want to end up a sloppy drunk. I like Miller and Bud Light, which I think most bars in the city provide.

After, It's another Uber/Lyft to Se7as bar, which looks like great fun according to Google. Since I'm Irish, I then plan to visit Duffy's Tavern - which looks like such a chill spot.

And that's about as exciting as Day 1 gets! It will probably be after 7 PM by the time I get to leave the hotel, and I'll probably be tired after travelling by air all day. As for food, I'll eat in one or two of the bars.

# Day 2 -Little Havana and Downtown

If I've time, I'll visit a grocery store to pick up a few snacks. The hotel provides plenty, but I'll still make the visit for a basic shop.

I'll then head to Little Havana (I'll walk if I'm okay for time) as I've booked a Walking Tour which embraces you in Cuban Culture. It also brings you to places where Cuban Cigars are made, Cuban Food and a lesson on some historic Cuban sites. Looking forward to it!

Once this is done. I might stick around the neighbourhood to explore it a little more, but eventually, I need to get to the Downtown (I'll most likely walk) area as I've booked a Cruise from Sunset to darkness. This should last about an hour.

Once done, I'll explore downtown. I've noted that I should visit Over/Under, Mama Tried and The Lost Boy venues for a drink and some food. Thankfully these are located near to each other.

Once tired, it's an Uber/Lyft home.

# Day 3 - Wynwood, Biscayne Bay and Miami vs FSU in Hard Rock

Uber/Lyft again, this time to see the Wynwood walls. I booked a tour for about $15 and it takes about an hour. Looking forward to it! I had considered buying a ticket for the Buggy Tour, but it was $50, maybe it's worth it?

I'll then visit Gramps Bar for a bite to eat and a bottle of beer.

Walk to the Museum of Hip-Hop. I'm a big Hip-Hop fan, so getting to visit this should be great! I haven't bought a ticket yet, I think it's about $15. I'm also considering visiting the Museum of Graffiti. I'm undecided since the walls will already contain plenty of artwork.

Uber/Lyft to Biscayne Bay and visit Flannigans, which I know is a meme on this Subreddit. I think it's the Rib Rolls I have to try. Anyway, I'll watch the NCAAF games while I'm there as it's not too far from Hard Rock Stadium and have a beer or two.

Uber/Lyft to the stadium. I'm banking on this game being a late kickoff, but FSU doesn't look good at all, and the Miami Hurricanes do. I've a feeling it may be a 3:30 PM kickoff which means I'll have to alter my plans for the day entirely. My seat is at Midfield, in the nose bleeds, but close to the front of the section. It's the Hurricanes' sideline, so no sun issues regardless of kick-off time.

I was at the Georgia Tech and FSU game in Dublin, Ireland and purchased an FSU T-shirt. It's Irish branded and has the team's logo, will I be okay wearing this T-shirt or will it cause trouble? I'm hoping it'll be a conversation starter with people on the day. I'm looking forward to seeing the Miami team, the QB Cam Ward has impressed me over the past 2 weeks.

Once the game is done, I'll have to head back to the hotel. This might be an issue of traffic, but I have an early start on Sunday.

# Day 4 - Dolphins vs Cardinals in Hard Rock

It's an Uber/Lyft to the Miami Dolphins Tailgate near the stadium. A friend who lives there has kindly invited us along. This means I'll need to be there from around 10 AM to 10:30 AM.

Meet my buddies at the tailgate, enjoy it and enter the stadium for the game.

Here's the kicker, I'm on the side where the sun beams down. I read so much advice that I shouldn't do this, but I got a great offer on a seat at midfield so close to the field and I'm on the Cardinal sideline. Other options were in Row Z of the Dolphin sideline and cost more money. I am not sitting with my buddies, but that's okay.

After the game, the evening is wide open. I'm going to do whatever my friends want to do, which means probably going to Mid-Beach or South Beach to watch the evening games in a bar. This will be costly, but it's only one evening.

When it's home time, Uber/Lyft of course.

# Day 5 - South, Mid and North Beach, followed by Heat vs Pistons

When I decide to crawl out of bed with probably a hangover, I plan to visit the island. I plan to start from the bottom (South Pointe Park) and walk northwards for the day. Google Maps says this is doable in a few hours, but I have until 7 PM with pit stops here and there, so I'm in no hurry.

Maybe I'll rent a bike to explore South Pointe Park?

So, I've drawn up a list of sights I should see along the way on my walk, starting south and moving north, please see below:

1. South Pointe Park
2. Visit Ted's Hideaway
3. Miami Beach Boardwalk
4. Ocean Drive and Art Deco
5. Flamingo/Hummus
6. Mac's Club Deuce
7. Espanola Way
8. The Abbey Bar
9. Collins Avenue
10. Holocaust Memorial
11. Sunset Harbour (Maybe?)
12. Lost Weekend Bar (Maybe?)

Once that is all said and done, it's an Uber/Lyft to the Kaseya Arena for the Miami Heat and Detroit Pistons game. I'm sat pretty high up and far back, but hopefully I enjoy the game. Basketball is a sport I loved when I was younger, I even supported the Heat because Dwayne Wade was my favourite player, so it's a pleasure to get to see the team, live!

After that, it's home to bed.

# Day 6 - Advice Needed, No plans made as of yet

I'm considering either travelling to Fort Lauderdale or to the Miami Everglades, but honestly I am totally undecided. I'm open to any other suggestions from you locals, as well!

The Everglades was my original plan, but 2 people have told me it wasn't that good. I'd be doing the typical tourist thing - boat ride, a wildlife show etc.

Fort Lauderdale looks fabulous from the pictures I've seen online. I will have to travel there by train, though. When there, I think I'll do a cruise which lasts an hour or two.

# Day 7 - Hop on/Hop off Bus Tour, Airport and Home to Ireland

I've decided on going with the bus tour so I can take in the sights one final time and stop off at some places which I never got to see over the 6 days. I'm lucky that my bag will be stored away somewhere safe, so I won't need to worry about it until it's time to go to the airport.

My flight is at 10PM, so I have the entire day to see everything one final time.

# Other things I feel I should add

I've stumbled upon a list (Sorry, I've saved this post as a draft twice now) I curated with questions I'd like to ask locals. Please see below:

* What food should I get in Flannigan's? Rib Rolls or something else?
* I'm not a big beach guy, meaning I won't be going swimming. However, I will of course take a trip to the beach for the sights, to take photographs and all that.
* I wouldn't mind trying Argentinian food. Are there any good spots? I don't want to break the bank either, just try some Argentinian beef!
* Could someone recommend a good sports store? Basically, a big store which sells MLB, NHL, MLS and to a lesser extent NFL merchandise but not limited to Miami based teams... If such a place even exists!

I really can't think of what else to add right now. I just want to make sure I get this post to be right (Please don't delete AutoBot..). I'm not stressing about the trip or anything, I'm just looking to make sure I see/do as much as I can while there. If you've made it this far into the post, I sincerely thank you for reading and hopefully you have some feedback for me.

Looking forward to visiting!",96,16,9843,1818,1

6 days in Tenerife ,"This was our honeymoon in mid September.

Buying agent's BAC has a protection period after it expires.

But also there is a 90 day protecting period after the contract elapses where I have to pay if I buy a similar property as specified above.

  
I have not seen this when interviewing other agents and asking for their BAC. And wonder ow to proceed. This is a blanket BAC from their brokerage. The ""protection period"" clause seems a bit encompassing since it in of itself is 3 months. ",85,14,618,110,0

Best places to add to my first multi-stop travel,"Im 22 years old and have decided to travel to (so far) 6 countries back to back, with around 5 days spent in each country.

So far i’ve decided to kick it off with going to egypt first, then head to Thailand, then China, then Seoul and finishing it off in Japan.

Im very young obviously so money is scarce, i’ll have enough for the flights, and i’ve made the budget of $1000 for accommodation/food. I plan on staying in cheap hotels / hostels most of the time, with thailand being the only exception as it is so cheap there to book a decent airbnb.

Im very early into the planning, and i will most likely get this trip done in either January or February. With the months in consideration, i know i might have to remove/add some destinations i just havent thought of yet. Thats were this post comes in! I was hoping i’d get some great recommendations that would fit this backpacking trip.

im excluding mexico/brazil and every country in that region as i just dont feel experienced enough to navigate well through there.

My main goal is to experience rich culture but also see some beautiful landscapes (hence China and Egypt)

Neighbors had patio approved by zoning because there are no retaining wall regulations. ,"
Hello all,

I live in a suburban neighborhood with an HOA near Nashville, TN. My neighbors decided to build a deck and raised patio. The patio is about 4.5 feet tall and one corner is 6 inches from our shared fence. We know that zoning in our area requires a 10 foot setback so we talked to the neighbors, then we talked to zoning. Everyone at zoning told us the same thing, they need to take it down. 

Well, here we are months later and somehow the neighbors have had the patio approved by the city. The zoning administrator said it’s a retaining wall and apparently Nashville has 0 codes about retaining walls so you can truck dirt in, build whatever you want and call it a retaining wall. We went higher up and they said the same thing and that they need to “add some codes.”

There’s even a 20 ft drainage easement that goes through their property they somehow got approval to ignore! And we now see flooding in our yard. 

So we were told by the city we can file an appeal. 

The HOA is considering approving it to avoid a legal battle. 

We’d like to provide some evidence to the board that this does affect our home value and ability to resell, but aren’t sure how to go about it. 

Do we have any other options? It literally feels insane that they can have this tall patio so close to us that they can literally sit and just look down at us while their dog barks. I mean we bought in an HOA for some security and now they’ve got their little pervert patio and we’re just stuck?? ",88,14,1489,281,0

Muni Inspections - Feeling Burned - Community Anger Poll,"Hi - we sold a house for $425k in an older community in the St. Louis area after living there six years. House appreciated over time but nothing too crazy.

We had a number of muni inspection findings after a clean private inspection from the buyer, including the need to install risers on stairs people had used for 100 years without issue.

These findings ended up costing $6k, no big deal to us in the grand scheme of things but completely unanticipated. And the time spent to tick and tie each issue was brutal

Buying a renter occupied house,"Hi all! My wife and I found a great house in our budget, but of course there is renters currently occupying the house. Their lease goes until May 2025. Our own lease isn't up until June 2025 so that actually works out pretty well.

We are considering locking in this house since price have softened quite a bit in our area and interest rates are coming down. We fear that by May the market will have heated back up.

I am told that the tenants are aware that the house is for sale, and that they themselves are looking to buy a different house in the next 6 months. Theoretically there should be no problems with them moving out come May.

I am worried though about my mortgage. Would this be considered an investment property since I will not be occupying the house for \~6 months? Would that affect my interest rate? Also would I need to get a special landlord insurance?

Is this a bad idea?

Thanks in advance!

Asking tenants to move out prior to putting house on market ,"Well, getting ready to sell my rental house. Tenants have been there about 9 years.

And no I will not put it on the market with tenants still in it if at all possible. It would cause me to lose way too much money. 
I have thought about offering cash for keys just to keep it easy and fast. 

With the way the prices have raised over the years, it would not be an investment for anyone else. It needs to go back to being owner occupied. (How it was when I bought it). 

We thought we may move back one day, but it doesn’t look like it now.

Unsure of listing price ,"We have a 1000 sq ft 2 bed 1 bath house in Ann Arbor, MI. If you’re familiar with the area you’ll know that cost of living is almost comparable to Chicago due to the demand of wanting to live in a cultured bubble of safety near UofM with good schools.

Since August, the market seems to have turned with houses sitting for longer or needing to reduce their prices. My realtor is not a local (regretting that now) and seems convinced that $350K is a good listing price. The caveat is I see some 3 beds 1 baths at 1000 sq ft listing for $330-350 and sitting/lowering price. Our house is unique in that the curb appeal could not be better and we have lots of high end upgrades like crown molding, trex decking, Motawi tile fireplace surround, and more. It’s a beautiful house, and anyone who has ever come over has said as much. 

My gut says list at $330K and get more interest instead of listing at $350 and getting less interest, possibly having to reduce the price.

Are my parents out of touch about giving out their information to lenders/brokers or is this the norm?,"Basically my parents haven’t been in the house market for over 20 years…. They’re trying to move in the next 6months, but they refuse to give out their information to any lenders/ brokers beyond like a gross yearly income and a screen shot of their current credit rating….. They have “exceptional” credit (highest scores you can have I guess) but any ways. 

they don’t trust any one with their personal information and don’t understand why they need to give out all their information to get a quote on how much of a loan they qualify for or what interest rate they will be quoted.  We spoke with one lender today and she wanted their W2s for the last year, pay stubs for the last two months, pictures of their drivers licenses and their credit info, documentation of their current bank account balances and a bunch of other information before she could give them an idea of what they qualify for or an interest rate. It’s safe to say, they are super freaked out now because they are really protective of their private information and don’t understand why they need to share this much information just to get a basic quote when they don’t even know if they went to commit to doing business with that lender or not. Ideally they would like to shop around and get several quotes so they can get the best interest rate. 
In their case they would be looking for a conventional loan. 

I guess my question is, is this the norm? Are they going to be expected to give up all of this sensitive information to every single broker/ lender they reach out to just to get a quote? Idk enough about this to be a voice of assurance or not so I would really appreciate if others could weigh in here. 
I can’t tell if they are right to be skeptical or if this is just how things are now and they are just out of touch

Thank you!

AZ Real Estate Exam,"After completing my licensing exam I figured I’d give you my thoughts and ideas about the 3 tests you must complete to start your journey in Real Estate

90 Hour Pre Licensing Course: 
I took my course through Aceable agent which was all online. I thought the course was very simple to use and I enjoyed watching the videos and being able to listen to the chapters. The class itself was very simple and straight forward. In my opinion they teach you all what you need to know for the tests. 

The test: 
(I had an earlier post regarding this because I was terrified of taking this test as you only have 2 attempts before you are required to restart the class) The test itself was very easy. I had taken the practice tests on the class website 4 times. Each test being 180 questions long. I also took the smaller practice tests for each chapter (I believe 27 chapters) 3 times each. Along with the Prep Agent website. I passed on my first try with an 83%. Had I not changed a few answers at the end I would’ve had a 90+. But a pass is a pass! 

The Writing Contract Test:
I took this test shortly after the final course exam so that everything was still fresh. With this test as you may know it is unlimited attempts. There was virtually nothing to really study besides the study guide given to you. Having no real practice tests it was difficult to really study as the study guide is a mere 6 pages long full of definitions you already learned. Because I had studied so hard for my first test I figured I’d be able to pass this test first try. I was wrong.. I went in blind and failed the test with a 76% as it is only 25 questions and you must receive a 80% percent to pass. I took the test again a few minutes later and passed. Helpful hints: pay attention to the wording and know your definitions of easements, time, possession trust, trustee, trustor etc.. Wasn’t very difficult in all honesty

The License Exam:
For this test I figured I’d just study again through Prep Agent, Aceable Agent. I repeated the same process by taking the tests over and over again memorizing the questions and answers. As the test date was approaching I went on Pearson Vue and decided to spend the $20 to take their practice test. It is 80 questions and only 1 test. There is only 1 test form as well. I took it after receiving high grades on my other study tests and received a 62/80. It tells you what categories to focus on and what you scored in those categories but doesn’t tell you what answers you got wrong. A took it again and received a 75%. Figured I was good to go on the actual test now. I studied and studied all the way up till the exam. Walked in to the testing center and was shitting bricks. I was stunned with what was on the test. I felt so unprepared. Even after spending a week and a half solely studying for 6 hours a day. The wording was much different from anything I’ve seen before on my other practice tests. It took me 4.5 hours to finish because I reviewed the test 4 times. 195 question test x 4 . Each time I went over a question I was more confident in my answer.. I scored a 66%. Again the rest doesn’t tell you what answers were wrong or right just what you scored on categories. Boy was I bummed. I went back to studying the next day. This time with a different approach. I read somewhere on here that a website called The Night Before The Exam was very good to study so I tried that along with Prep Agent. Swapping back and forth between the 2. I spent another week studying 6 hours a day. I took the second test with much more confidence and did it under an hour and a half.. Failed with a 74%. Bummed was an understatement but I was soo close. I buckled up my studying and was able to review my last test on the answers I got wrong. Took my 3rd test 2 days after my 2nd. It was much harder than any other test I had previously. It was as if every difficult question I’ve had were all thrown into 1 test. During the test I thought to myself “ I definitely bombed this test “ Long story short. I somehow managed to pass! 

Highlights: Prep Agent I found was useful. Not perfect but very useful. The Night Before the Exam was extremely helpful in the wording and understanding of topics. And lastly if you have the money for it I would suggest taking the Pearson Practice Exam a couple times so that you are familiar with the wording in the actual test. Good luck and thanks for reading!

I recently contacted the Schiphol Airport Porter Service (Amsterdam) to arrange assistance for an elderly family member who needed help with their baggage. To my surprise, they told me that the elderly person has to collect their bags from the luggage belt themselves because porters are not allowed to pick up luggage from the belt.

Honestly, this seems pretty useless. If an elderly person can lift their bags off the belt, how hard could it be for them to push a trolley afterward?! The whole point was to provide assistance where it's most needed, but it seems the service doesn't cover that crucial part.

Has anyone else experienced this or encountered the same issue with them? Any advice on alternative services would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance.",70,11,785,126,1

Prague Christmas market,"Saw a post on facebook today talking about a day trip to Prague Christmas market


I am relatively inexperienced in the world of Christmas markets, but looking at flights it seems doable.


Has anyone been to Prague Christmas market before? Is there any better timewise? Are the evenings/nights better than day time? 
Is that essential to the ambience/experience, in which case an overnight is needed?

Or is it doable and worth it if only for a day?

Home buying question,My fiancé and I are getting married in May and are deciding what we want to do. We are either going to stay in our apartment for 3ish years and save for our forever home or we’re going to buy a condo right after the wedding and save for our forever home over 4-5 years. In our area the condos we’re looking at are around $350K-400K and our forever homes are around $600-700K. Would it be a dumb idea to buy only to live in it for 4-5 years then either sell or rent the condo out or should we just stay in the apartment and save for our forever home? ,20,3,550,112,0

I have three weeks to fill between England and Berlin in Nov. What's off the beaten track?

I want to take my time while also seeing as many cool things as I can before I fly back to the my side of the globe.

  
I've got some ideas of what I want to see: definitely spend time exploring London and Berlin, stop off somewhere in the Netherlands, look into stopping off in Scotland or France (but I bet it will be very cold and dark in Scotland!). I'm super interested in the history and the culture, so looking for museums and old architecture, and anything else that will be a fun memory.

  
So my big questions are:

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

Group Investment Property Purchase?,"

I am wondering the best way to purchase a property as an investment between 3-4 people who will be sharing the costs of rehabbing the 4 unit apartment building. I'm in California if that matters. 

I have an idea in mind that we will each produce what we can in funding and get a hard money loan - fix up the property enough to then qualify for a conventional mortgage with an FHA owner-occupied loan that's low interest/down payment (by moving in myself for at least 3 years), then rent out the other units at profitable market rates and hold the asset for a few years or sell at a big profit down the road. 

What's the best way to set this up? Should we form a trust or LLC with the 3-4 members and terms of repayment of investment plus interest once profitable? Who would I even talk to about this?

Thanks!",35,4,813,152,0
"Seller breached contract, now what?","I'll try to make this short and to the point, but there are a lot of moving parts.

We are supposed to close today on a property.  
The property has a home, a 2500+ sqft shop, and a very large pole barn (that has a lot of junk and debris inside).  
At one point the shop was used to commercially grow marijuana. It had a mini split AC unit, fully working fans, grow lights, hvac system, heating, water tanks etc.

In our contract, our ONE condition was that the shop be included as is, and all equipment stay, everything inside stay. We would allow the pole barn to be left as is (they wouldn't need to clean it out) so long as everything in the shop stayed.

Well today we went to do a final walkthrough and the shop had been ransacked. Mini split had been removed, grow lights gone, vents gone, everything was gutted and trashed. There's shit everywhere and they basically took everything valuable and left everything else in shambles thrown around.

We found out that the sellers agent told the seller that she could take whatever she wanted? (clearly didn't follow the contract)

We're kind of at a loss right now. The value of the shop is now significantly lower, we would have to do a considerable amount of work to restore it to working condition.  
Should we hire a lawyer?





Edited to add:
Exact wording from contract

PERSONAL PROPERTY: Only the following personal property, in ""AS-IS"" condition and at no stated value is included: (describe)
*ALL EQUIPMENT AND ITEMS IN SHOP SHALL REMAIN.”

Purchasing from OpenDoor - advice needed! ,"My boyfriend and I are trying to buy a house in CO from OpenDoor and we’re running into some issues. We’re in love with the house and the neighborhood and it seemed to be the best quality home in our price range. We just got our inspection results and they aren’t looking so good. 

The roof needs to be replaced, the furnace fills the house with smoke when you use it (the inspector was afraid to even try the A/C because of the furnace), the water heater is 5 years past due for replacement and the water pressure is way too high so a water pressure regulator needs to be installed. We don’t have the results of the sewer scope yet, so we don’t know what that looks like. 

The house was built in 1994 and flipped jut a month ago by OD. We’re worried that they’ll simply refuse to fix anything or they’ll just concede on the price which we can’t do because we won’t have money for big repairs until we sell our condo. The roof age alone makes the house essentially uninsurable in CO. We just aren’t confident that OD will make the necessary fixes (at least the roof and furnace/possibly AC). 

What can we expect from OD? It seems like they tend to just concede on the price, but that isn’t doable for us for all these fixes. Are they more likely to begrudgingly agree if we keep pushing since some of these issues impact the livability of the house? Any other buyer would get to this point and find the same issues… is it worth it to fight for it? This house is basically our dream home… any advice would be appreciate. ",42,7,1523,288,0

Do these tactics work?,"My husband and I are looking for a bigger place. We checked out a house last weekend during an open house… We have a realtor but only were semi-interested in the place, so we went to the open house instead of having him do a showing (informed the seller’s agent upon arrival that we have a realtor). She was super cool, friendly. No pressure. 

She told us the sellers want to sell quickly. Admitted to us that the house needs some updating and whatnot. 

The house was listed less than a week and was dropped $40k in price. Another two open houses scheduled for this weekend. My husband went back just for a closer look. This time, the seller’s agent sent her niece (also realtor) to do the open house. Niece made sure to act like she didn’t care about his presence and told him “oh yeah, we reached out to some investors. The house will sell in the next couple days.” 

As he was looking around, she was talking to another associate of some sort, loudly saying “oh yeah, they’re probably going to write an offer today….” (about someone else). Cool. We better hurry and send an offer right away. /s. 

My point is, do realtors really think this is going to work? The “we called the *investors*… Faceless people with lots of money. We don’t need you.” Cool then. Sell to an investor for much lower than ya want to get… they’re going to want a deal if the place needs work. They’re not going to pay current asking just to break even or lose money after updating. House is listed only slightly lower than recent comps. Just annoying. Then don’t do an open house? 

My husband was hoping to get a little more info on the place, and then if we decided it was worth it, have our realtor make some calls. We are slower to make big decisions, which is why he went back a second time (this time, without two toddlers). The neighborhood is semi-desirable as far as location to downtown/central Phoenix… but other homes in the area are just kinda sitting. So there’s not really a fire under us for this specific house. It’s nice, but does need some love.",22,4,2044,376,0

25M US Citizen considering trip to Caracas,"So why the hell would I want to go there? I get that its a level 4 travel advisory and honestly a huge part of my brain is screaming at me to not go but I also don't know if its something I can avoid. My grandmother who spent years in the united states and played a large part in raising both my sister and me moved back to Caracas in 2012/2013ish. She was not here legally and I don't think there is likely any chance of her being allowed back into the united states. She is mostly blind and has a hard time moving around so I also don't think it would be feasible to have her travel elsewhere and meet her somewhere outside of the country.

I am white as hell and barely speak Spanish (understand a bit just cant speak much) which absolutely doesn't help.

Feedback on 3-week Mexico itinerary,"Hi there - my SO and I are visiting Mexico from mid Nov to early Dec. We will be there for just over 3 weeks, which hopefully gives us enough time to explore 2-3 regions and have a good variety of experiences (cities, beaches, etc.). This is our high-level itinerary so far:

**Days 1-5: Mexico City**

* Including day trip to Teotihuacán

**Days 5-8: Bacalar** (fly to Chetumal from Mexico City, then bus to Bacalar)

**Days 8-11: Valladodid** (ADO bus from Bacalar)

* Including day trips to Chichén Itzá/Rosalia Chay Chuc/cenotes)

**Days 11-14: Merida** (ADO bus from Valladodid)

* Including day trips to Uxmal/Ek-Balam/cenotes

**Days 14-17: Oaxaca City** (fly from Merida)

* Including day trips to a mezcalería/Monte Albán/Hierve el Agua/Pueblos Mancomunados

**Days 17-21: Puerto Escondido** (ADO bus from Oaxaca)

* Including day trips to Mazunte/Zipolite/Chacahua National Park

**Days 21-23: Mexico City**

Have done quite a lot of research but wanted to check with those in the know if this itinerary makes sense or if we've missed anything! Some specific notes/questions:

* We've booked flights in and out of Mexico City (from Europe), besides that pretty open so far
* Have already cut a few places out (e.g. Puebla/Cholula) so the trip feels relaxing, but is this still too much? Or anything amazing missing?
* Don't plan to hire a car - happy to do it, but it doesn't seem necessary for the places we're visiting?
* We like exploring cities and walking (museums, markets, etc.), LOVE food and drink, and appreciate natural beauty
* Want some beach time but not into all-inclusive resorts/sleepy towns with nothing else to do - so thought Puerto Escondido/Bacalar were good options (aware Bacalar is not a beach, but think it counts as lazing by the water vibes)
* For beach we also considered Holbox (but were put off by bad reviews of sewage problems/flooding, power outages, mosquitoes, bad service, etc.) and Isla Mujeres/Cozumel (but hear they are too touristy/similar to Cancun/Tulum) - any other perspectives on this?
* Neither of us are particularly into archaeology/visiting ruins - does this mean we have too much time in Merida/Valladolid? Thinking we might just visit 1 or 2 of Chichén Itzá/Uxmal/Ek Balam and not all of them (similarly with the cenotes)
* We also briefly considered doing Jalisco (Guadalajara, Tequila, Puerto Vallarta, etc.) instead of Yucatan

From reading several threads on the topic, it seems like the approach should be something like:

1. Before making an offer, get pre-approved with several potential lenders
2. Make the offer using the pre-approval letter from the lender I like best (not necessarily the best rate)
3. Once I have an offer ratified, take the offer details to all the potential lenders and get a concrete loan estimate from each of them, with exact rate and closing costs
4. Take the best rate / closing cost / APR loan estimate to the lender I like best and ask them to match (or get as close as they can)
5. Ideally, they match the terms and I go with them instead

Landlords: would you allow tenant to renovate unit?,"Suppose you have a long-term tenant under rent control. They've been tenants for 40 years, far longer than you've owned the building. They pay on time and cause no problems. During this tenant's tenancy, the unit has received no maintenance, but as long as the unit is legally habitable, you are under no obligation to perform any maintenance.

The unit is habitable but shabby, to say the least. The hardwood floors are original, 96 years old. The kitchen sink, original, is almost rusted through. Over the years, the plaster walls have been repeatedly painted, as well as wallpapered and, at some point, textured, forming a thick crust. The natural alkalinity of plaster has dissolved the innermost coat of paint, and as a result, the crust on the walls is cracking and can easily be peeled off.

The tenant is requesting to fix all this at their effort and expense. They offer to hire someone licensed and insured to do the work. They acknowledge that spending money gives them no extra rights or privileges. In the alternative, they offer to move and suggest a cash-for-keys deal. In truth, if the unit were renovated, it could easily rent for twice what the tenant is paying. The unstated alternative, of course, is for the status quo to remain. The tenant could live another twenty years.

So whatever we choose, we probably wouldn't want to spend a ton of time in large metropolitan areas. We tend to like the more outdoorsy, scenic areas for vacationing. 

I would really love some advice, travel planning tips, anything that anyone can provide. If there is another location that would also work well for us I would greatly appreciate that. Thanks in advance!",47,8,1068,192,1
Bought home with undisclosed unpermitted structural work. Recourse?,"Hi all,

My family just a bought a house in MA which seemed darn good (and still is in many respects) and we moved in two months ago. We waived the inspection contingency (because eastern Massachusetts...) but still had one done. The inspection flagged a few items as needing to be done relatively quickly but only a few things that were egregious and we could rationalize how we'd need to do the work sooner rather than later anyway. As it turns out, we have since discovered that they made several severe structural modifications to the home that affect its load carrying ability.

To give you a flavor (there are others but these are what are weighing on our minds right now from a cost perspective):

1. Removing structural columns in the basement without reinforcing the load bearing spanning beams (we can find at least 3 points that have had columns removed over a span of &gt;25 feet)
2. Removing a load bearing wall on the second floor and resting the support column for the new posts directly on the floor joists
3. Improperly installing support columns in the basement either by not resting them directly on the wood beam or by using temporary columns instead of permanent ones

I'm fortunate enough to have the money and time to address many of these issues either myself or with the appropriate contractors and specialists (pulling and closing permits along the way, of course). We have been addressing the most pressing issues first (support columns to foundation floor and furnace) but these are starting to add up (think \~25k thus far). Our worry is that once we get into the structural issues on the second and third floor (which have caused pretty severe leans in the upper floors of \~3 inches over 10 feet towards the center of the home), we may be looking at six figure repair bills just to address necessary and severe structural issues. This is because we can no longer just go into unfinished space but need to demo ceilings, refinish rooms, etc. to fix the issues.

My question: Do we have any recourse if the home was represented as having no known unpermitted work by the previous owners and we can tie the work to them (in some cases with direct admissions of them having done the work themselves). The work was done after 2005 in all cases. I've put off asking the town permitting department directly for fear that they tell us absolutely nothing has been pulled in 30+ years and now we have to disclose that fact if we go to sell them home in the future.

I have a feeling I know the answer, but just wanted to get an outside perspective. Thanks all!",67,8,2581,451,0

"How to purchase a house under $100,000 without a kitchen?","Hey, I'm not currently buying at the moment but I'm trying to do research before I dive into the market. There's a house I'm looking at for $65,000 in Lynchburg, VA and the bones look good overall but it doesn't have a kitchen. I've learned that credit unions and local banks would be the best bet to get a mortgage under $100k, but now I'm learning that most banks won't lend on a home without a kitchen. Do you think that a credit union would do the same? I don't want to do an FHA loan because I've wood worked before and want to build the cabinetry myself, plus my brother is a contractor so he could answer any questions I had along the way in doing cosmetic renovations around the house. We want to be able to move in and slowly renovate the home ourselves over time, so the FHA route doesn't really work for that since you have to hire a contractor (my brother doesn't live in state so it wouldn't be possible for him to help in that way). I estimated I have enough room in a line of credit I already have to purchase the basics I would need to build something like the kitchen cabinets and countertop so I wouldn't need to take out another loan for those items. 

So if I wanted to do something like that, is there a specific route I could take? 

Also, does anyone know if we'd be able to legally live in the home before the kitchen is finished? From what I've read it's probably a no, but I thought I'd ask because we'd be relocating to town so we'd have to get an Air BnB or hotel until we finished the kitchen then, which seems like wasted money if we already own a home technically. And we'd be fine with using a hot plate or slow cooker until the kitchen was ready. But I'm guessing that's a no. ",57,10,1710,331,0

"Connecting through Miami International on Friday, should I change it?","I'm flying from South America to Chicago via Miami on Friday the 11th, and this hurricane that's brewing has me worried. 

It's not supposed to hit Miami as of right now but that could change. Also Friday is like 2 days after the estimated landfall that's going to be on Wednesday and it should've dissipated by then but I don't know how much.

What worries me is that if the area surrounding the airport floods then they're probably going to close that airport. 

It's very important that I get to Chicago on Friday so I can't move the trip to next week. 

It's going to be me and my wife but we're in separate reservations. Hers is paid with cash and has a strict cancellation policy and mine was with miles and has a flexible cancelation policy. 

I have the option of flying through Houston instead, which will give me a little peace of mind but we would be forfeiting her ticket and losing that money. The thing is that I should make the decision today, bc the price is still kinda reasonable. 

So my options would be, waiting it out and leaving everything as is, but risk my trip getting upended by the hurricane, or losing my wife's ticket money and just changing my ticket and buying a new one for her (but risking that Miami would be unscathed and I spent all that money for nothing)

Can someone help me understand my capital gains situation? Our house has shot up in value but we're downsizing. Details below. [CO],"Talking about primary residences here.  So we bought a house for $750,000 ten years ago, it's been our primary residence for ten straight years.  We've put about $250,000 into it over the years, so let's say our cost basis is $1M.

"If You Can Handle India, Can You Handle Egypt? A Solo Traveler’s Experience","I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",75,13,2624,452,1

Looking for some advice on a crazy situation involving my family home,"This is a pretty bizarre situation that several realtors and lawyers we’ve talked to have never been in.

So about a decade ago, my parents had to declare bankruptcy, and got screwed over by a scummy lawyer that intentionally filed the wrong class of bankruptcy. This resulted in my dad going a while without insulin for his diabetes (this may be relevant later), leading to significant damage to his heart. One day they woke up, they were informed the house wasn’t protected, and had to provide $30,000 (the remaining cost of the $200,000 home they had been paying off since the 90s) within a week, or the house was gone. 

My mom’s sister stepped in, and “purchased” the house. She had arranged with my parents that they would pay her back monthly, basically rent, until she was made whole (and my parents would also be responsible for paying the property taxes as well, which they did). I was told that the purchase was a little murky and the lawyers had to leave the room when the deal was signed.

After around 5 years pass, my parents approach my aunt, after calculating they had paid her back plus some interest, about receiving ownership of the house. We had issues with properly filing insurance claims through my aunt as well, as when severe weather events affected the house (we live in Houston, Texas), she would send out a friend of hers to fix things that seemed out of his ability. My aunt basically says “sure, you can purchase my house for $180,000”. My parents are floored, and both parties lawyer up. Our lawyer advises us we may have claim to our house due to some Homestead Act, and that we should try to pressure my aunt with court.

Eventually, my parents and my aunt go to mediation, where my aunt refuses to negotiate. They spend a whole day trying to make offers to which my aunt would not budge. Paying for the lawyer starts to get expensive, but luckily this lawyer is a family friend who gets flexible with payment. My Dad gets laid off by his new company out of nowhere after being there for years, and ends up filing (and successfully settling) an age discrimination case, but unfortunately he could not afford his heart medication for a month during all this and takes a serious step back health wise. He finds a new job, but gets let go shortly after being hired, and ends up in the hospital for a week where he loses a bunch of weight. He finally finds a new job (which seems like a much better fit for him, that also offers a life insurance policy that conveniently would cover the price of the house). 

My parents and my aunt go to court for a second mediation. At the beginning, our lawyer informs us we shouldn’t go to court, and that the case needs to be settled, and that he won’t be willing to represent us in court (it seems like this case is costing him money that he won’t be making back at this point). My parents are shocked again, and my mom storms out of court, but they say they understand and offer 180,000 for the house. The mediator comes back and informs us my aunt is now asking for $280,000, as she now has familial debt to repay (I guess that’s how she could afford her lawyer this whole time).

Eventually, they reach an agreement. The deal is that they have 90 days to qualify to purchase the house at $235,000, and if they don’t qualify in 90 days, they agree to sell the house in the next 90 days, where my aunt gets the first $250,000, and then my parents get whatever is made above that (the house could go for anywhere from $278,000 to $370,000 according to OpenDoor, but there’s some significant repairs required that will likely cost a chunk). If no deal is reached, i believe the agreement states that anyone living on the property is expected to vacate, and they are to return to mediation. My parents agree to this primarily because their combined income is comfortably enough to qualify for the house. My dad signs, and my mom does as well but she was not present for a lot of the case (as she kept storming out of the court room)

3 days later, I get a call from my mom to check on my dad and find him dead in our living room. He started his new job the day before, and was extremely dizzy and fell the night before. Doctors warned a fall could kill him because of his meds, but he was scared of going to the hospital again and losing his new job. He started his new job on the day before, signed up for benefits but apparently the life insurance doesn’t kick in for 30 days (and we couldn’t get any through his last job, so we’re at zero i think). He mentioned he felt he needed to lower his medication due to weight he lost in the hospital as well, but didn’t get to.

It looks like my mom can not afford to qualify for $235,000 by herself. Ironically, it looks like the most she could qualify for herself is $180,000 (I believe she makes around 47,000 a year between 2 jobs). I’m a recent college grad (I’m a music teacher, not a lot of money) and have only been working for a year and a half (and honestly, I don’t know if purchasing this house is smart for me). I live with my partner who could theoretically qualify with my mom, but they also are very hesitant about purchasing the house (houses are expensive, the place needs some pretty big repairs, and often we struggle to get along with my mom). We also have a few roommates lined up and are getting ready to move out, and fear if we don’t move out now, we may not still have the roommates lined up in a few months (we may have them still, just can’t really predict things like this).


Is there any world where we can save the house without my partner or me trying to purchase it with my mom? My aunt refuses to talk to us and there’s been issues communicating with our lawyer since my dad died, and we only have about a month left to qualify if we want to try. I’m just looking for my options or solutions, and want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation. Is there a world where my mom can keep this house by herself? If not, do you think it’s smarter for me to walk away, or to spend a few months here trying to repair it and sell it with my mom so my partner and I walk away with some of the profit, as well as making sure everyone is in a spot where they can afford to move out instead of being at the behest of the courts?

TL:DR my family home was legally(?) stolen by my aunt, and my parents agreed to purchase it a week before my dad died. Now my mom can’t afford it, and I don’t know what to do.",69,12,6448,1212,0
Neighbor with security cams chasing away buyers by lying that I am a felon?  ,"My neighbor is going up to potential buyers or workers when they come to view the property and telling them that I am a felon, I have an arrest warrant, or my property sale is a scam.

Can’t pick a destination for a short holiday in Europe,"My boyfriend and I want to go on a short trip in mid-November and we can’t decide on where to go!
We are willing to spend up to four (rather three) nights depending on how much there is to see.

- Edinburgh
- Copenhagen 
- Lisbon
- Budapest

Refinancing at current rates ,"Good Morning! 

My partner and I bought our home over a year ago. At the height of the interest rates (7.5%) mainly due to the market being in a stand still. I always heard buy when others are scared. I saw a worthy investment for my first home. Now rates seem to be hovering at 5.5%. 

Does having a large amount of equity help with refinance rates? Does it play any role at all? We have excellent credit but want to wait until we are done renovating our home before refinancing as we need to get another appraisal. 

I am just questioning if having a large amount of equity will help us when it comes to refinancing? If I had to be conservative we have at least 200k+ of equity. It was in dire need of repairs which we handled on our own (architect partner, my dad owns a company in the trades).

Thoughts on how to upgrade from condo to single family home?,"Howdy! Really hoping that I may be able to tap into the wisdom and expertise of more seasoned homeowners on this forum :) 

A bit of background. I am a 40-year-old single man. Back in May 2021, I went under contract to purchase my first home (a new build 2 bed/2bath condo in a suburb of Denver). I closed in the Fall of 2021. I locked in at an interest rate of just over 3% and paid about $325K for the property.  

My lifelong dream has been to own a single-family home. I don't necessarily want a large home as it's just me, but I'd love to buy a smaller home with a yard where I can have a garden. I'd even be open to a townhouse with a small fenced in yard. Townhomes with yards and starter single family homes in my area start at about $450 to $500K and go up from there. 

When I purchased my condo, I had a salary of just over $60K, but I've worked hard over the past few years and recently secured a promotion. I am now making $108K ($123K with bonus potential). Looking at online mortgage calculators, it looks like this salary puts me in the range to possibly upgrade to a townhome or single-family home. 

I've only been in my condo for 3 years, and my understanding is that ideally it's best to stay in your home for at least 5 years. I'm not sure how accurate they are, but some of the mortgage rate forecasts that I've been reading are forecasting that mortgage rates may drop below 5% and could even get closer to 4% in 2027/2028 (I take those forecasts with a grain of salt as there are so many variables, and no one has a crystal ball). Regardless, I likely wouldn't plan to buy another place for at least a couple more years. 

I'm looking for advice as to how I can prepare myself to be in a position to upgrade in 2 to 3 years. I've worked very hard to improve my financial situation over the past couple years. Last month, I achieved a financial goal of having a six-month emergency fund in place, which I feel really good about. Now, I'd like to open a second high yield savings account to start pumping money into so that I can come to my next home purchase with as high of a down payment as possible. I'm thinking it would be wiser to save my down payment as opposed to investing? Also, thinking long term, I wonder if it would make sense to eventually rent out my condo since I have such a low interest rate on it, and take out a second mortgage for my next home purchase, or would it be better to sell the condo and roll the equity into my next down payment? 

Lastly, I feel like I'm getting a late start in life on all of this. I feel behind for my age, and I'm desperately trying to catch up. By the time I purchase my next home, I will be nearing my mid-40s. I'm new to all of this, and I worry that I've missed the boat in a lot of ways as I didn't buy real estate when I was younger, and before home prices exploded. I think I'm just needing some encouragement and some good advice as to where I should go from here. Any tips from anyone else who has been in a similar situation? Should I just keep saving as much as I can, then be ready when the right opportunity comes along? Anything else I should be doing to get myself in the best situation possible?

Did my realtor misadvise me?,"Realtor

Put offer in on a home that was originally priced at 300k, but went down to 290k about five days ago. I’ve been considering it as an option the entire time it’s been on the market. Because no offers had come through yet, I decided to offer 285k. I asked my realtor if I should pay closing costs (my own) and she said absolutely. The seller’s realtor apparently said he liked the offer, but the sellers have had to adjust their expectations a lot so it was hard to swallow. They’re going to all meet tomorrow night and will have a response to us by 6pm. Assumedly this is to hopefully get other offers in. 

After thinking about it and researching, I don't get why she didn't suggest I pay 291k and ask that the sellers pay my 6k closing costs instead of what I did, which is offer 285k and pay my own 6k closing costs out of pocket, which is in addition to the 6k of 'pre-paid fees' I'll have to pay in cash.

I acknowledge I very well could be wrong here but it’s my understanding that if I ask the sellers to cover the closing costs while increasing my offer price by that amount, they would still get the full sale price at closing which is good for them. If I pay the closing costs myself, it reduces the net amount they receive from the sale because the total amount they get at closing includes the sale price minus any seller concessions (like covering closing costs….). It seemed counterintuitive at first until I understood it (which I think I do).

My goal is ultimately to minimize my upfront costs (while being reasonable about my monthly payments which I already had an estimate for and was ok with)… while being as attractive to the sellers as I can.

I’m holding some space for there being a piece I’m missing because I am obviously not savvy at this, but I think by sending that offer, it looks like I’m prioritizing and trying to negotiate for a lower purchase price even though it’s not beneficial for either party. Even if I were better off and just had that kind of cash to drop to make my monthly payments a little lower, I wouldn’t want to do it because it’s less attractive to the sellers and sends a confusing message. At the end of the day it looks like I’m either aggressively trying to tell them I think the home is still overpriced or I just don’t understand the market.

My realtor initially called me when she heard back from the other realtor and that's when she told me the sellers had a hard time swallowing my offer and that they were going to meet with their realtor tomorrow night. She called me again a bit later saying she thought about it and thinks I should maybe increase my offer by a few thousand to 'get them moving,' and also mentioned that they would specifically get back to us by 6pm tomorrow (not sure why she didn't tell me that the first time). I said no, if I increase my offer now and find out someone else places an offer tomorrow, I'll potentially up mine even more knowing I'm competing, and if no one offers, then I would have just raised my offer for nothing. They're going to hold out until 6pm tomorrow for other offers whether I increase mine or not, because it's the smart thing to do. It would be different if I increased and said they had til 10am to accept or not or something (which I didn’t think of until we were off the phone, but also needed a second to sort through things).

I wonder if she just called me to suggest that because she realized she made a mistake/didn't weight the options correctly and would have addressed it if I agreed or if she really just thought that was wise.

And maybe in the end I'm wrong. But I'll find out when she calls me in the morning. Bloody hell.

Thoughts?? Am I overthinking it??",28,5,3696,684,0
Looking for Advice on my Rough St. Lucia Itinerary,"Hi all, my partner and I (man/woman) are planning to do a 7 day trip to St. Lucia this December. The rough plan is as follows:

Arrive at Hewanorra Airport, take a taxi or some form of transport to Castries. Stay for 3 or 4 nights. Couple of beach days, exploring Castries, trying the different food, museums, etc. Maybe a night out at a bar/club if that's even a thing. Possibly take the ferry to Fort de France for a night in Martinique, not sure if this is worth it or how it would work.

Take some form of transport to Soufriere to stay there for the remainder of the trip, so 3 or 4 nights. Beach days, exploring the town, and we want to hike the Gran Piton. Then fly back out through Hewanorra.

Does this make sense as an itinerary? Is there any challenges we may face to look out for? What about lodging and transport? Thank you all for any help.",50,9,854,161,1

I don’t want to live in my home anymore but I have a great interest rate,"Hi, so I bought my 1br/1.5bath duplex down  condo in 2016 in Chicago for 176k and I’m really wanting a place with more sunlight. My interest rate on the house is 3.8% and I pay a little over a 1k a month plus HOA. My building has a rental cap and discourages renting out and idk that I’d really want to be a landlord. Would it be incredibly stupid to sell my place and buy again in the city?

"Anyone know of any beach towns similar to Sayulita, Mexico? ","If anyone on this sub has ever been to Sayulita, MX and found somewhere with some similar vibes?

I had a trip of a lifetime there a few years ago unexpectedly. Despite Sayulita’s struggles around sewage, trash, and being a bustling party scene, I found a lot of magic and wonder there.

Realtor’s Mistake on Commission - What Are My Options?,"
I’m in the process of selling my home, and after some deliberation, I chose a realtor who I thought could handle the job. However, I’ve noticed that they don’t seem to pay much attention to detail when it comes to paperwork, and that’s starting to become a serious issue.

The current problem is that I signed an Exclusive Seller Brokerage Engagement Agreement with the realtor, where we initially agreed on a 5% commission. So far, so good. But when it came to the listing agreement, they mistakenly entered a 2% commission. I flagged this mistake, and the realtor assured me they would correct it and resend the form for me to sign.

Fast forward to now, the agent sent me the revised listing agreement—except it still had the same 2% commission. The rest of the document was correct, so I went ahead and signed it. To add some context, I had previously sent them an extensive email pointing out the small mistakes I’d been noticing and asked them to take more care, so we wouldn’t run into these issues.

Now, with both parties having signed the listing agreement showing a 2% commission, my question is: Is the realtor legally bound to honor that 2% commission? Or can they refuse to list the property unless I agree to change it to the 5%, despite the fact that I warned them about these kinds of mistakes?

For reference, the realtor has been in the business for nearly 30 years, so this isn’t exactly their first rodeo. I’m curious if anyone has faced something similar or has any insights on how this might play out legally.",54,9,1533,269,0
How is this Switzerland itinerary for Jan?,"Me and my family will be in Lyon over January and we want to spend a week in Switzerland. It'll be me + partner and 2 kids (6 and 10).

we probably don't want to ski - but we do kind of want to see mountain sides and pretty lakes and build snowmen and go tobogganing and do touristy things.

Is this a reasonable itinerary?

Day1 -&gt; Lyon -&gt; Lucerne (5 hours train) so get there at night  
Day 2 -&gt; Lucerne (go up to Mt Rigi or Mt Titlus - would this be too hard on a 6 year old?)  
Day 3 -&gt; Lucerne (maybe take a day trip to go into Zurich since only an hour away)  
Day 4 -&gt; Take train to Interlaken (3 hrs travel so only a half day by the time we arrive)  
Day 5 -&gt; Interlaken (maybe a day trip to Grindelwald)  
Day 6 -&gt; Montreux (2 hrs travel so probably there mid avo and there explore the city and lake)  
Day 7 - Montreux (maybe go to Glacier 3000)  
Day 8 -&gt; Take train back to Lyon (5 hours so will get there at night)

Is this at a reasonable pace? Should I spend more or less time in certain places? I'll basically have three bases (Lucerne, Interlaken and Montreux) - is this too many bases? Should I cut it down to two (Lucerne and either Montruex or Interlaken) and try to do more day trips from these places? My concern is with kids, it's kind of a hassle every time I have to move out of one hotel to another.

Finally, any places I've omitted here that you think I should put in? For example, I've picked Interlaken over Zermatt mainly because Zermatt seems like the resorty and expensive version of Interlaken. I've also omitted Zurich other than a maybe day trip just because I figure the best part of the Switzerland is in the country side and not in the city - although there might be more kids activities in Zurich)",42,7,1761,343,1
Destination indecision - thoughts wanted,"Hoping for some insight! Talking a two week trip at the end of November but can’t decide where. Getting close to being too late.

About me:

Traveling alone, single mid 40s male.

East Coast USA based.

Generally I love big cities but I also lean much more towards relaxing more than adventure. Beaches are ok. Hiking does nothing for me.

Which also means I generally don’t like more than 2 cities. 3 at a push. 1 is even fine if there are a bunch of day trips.

Museums are ok. Love street food and foodie stuff (non gourmet) in general.

Love things like replica markets. Love places like Akihabara.

Love animals so something like a town full of deer or monkeys or seeing elephants etc sounds great.

Pretty tall so long haul is hell unless I get a bulk head seat. This makes flights more expensive for me due to buying upgrades to get those seats.

Safety is huge for me. Hence why Colombia or Brazil or something doesn’t really interest me.

Would enjoy some dates while on vacation. At the very least mingling with locals. I love meeting people from different countries.

Destinations I’m considering most:

Asia:
Usually prefer Asia. 

Have been to Japan 3x already. Over a month in Tokyo, couple weeks in Osaka. Have been to Yokohama, Kyoto, Nara, and Kyoto already. I could spend a year in Tokyo honestly. But also feel like I should go see more places which would be Hiroshima, Nagoya, or Hokkaido next, preference wise. I also am conversational in Japanese and have a friend I might be able to see a couple days there. It also feels like a waste to learn Japanese and then not go to Japan. But it also feels silly on the other hand to only ever go to Japan. Catch-22 I guess. 

Philippines. Beaches! Manila looks chaotic but fun. People seem insanely friendly. Cebu area couple be cool. I’ve kind of been scared off of the infrastructure there but I don’t think that’s a huge deal just sort of an annoyance.

Thailand. 3 messages a day sounds great. Easy metro in Bangkok. My favorite type of food is Thai. Amazing looking old ruins and temples. This was my first plan before I started second guessing myself.

Vietnam maybe. Love the food.

However, SE Asia in general is about 30-35 hours each way which one, is insane (Japan is only around 17) and two, I lose two to three days of vacation to planes and airports. I also don’t sleep almost at all on planes so i might be going days without more than a few hours sleep and lose even more vacation time.


Americas:

Costa Rica. Just seems nice. I don’t know.  But is two weeks here too much?

Europe:

Portugal. Have always wanted to go. Looks great. Affordable.  Great food. Also I have a friend who would come see me for a weekend here which could be fun. 

Spain? So many great cities to see like Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastien, etc.

Italy. Would love to see Tuscany and Rome and Naples. Pompeii is a major bucket list place. Great food. Bucket list in general it’s freaking Italy. The ruins, the museums, the food, the countryside, it all just seems great. Same friend that would meet me for a weekend in Portugal would also be willing to meet for a weekend in Italy. 

But I’ve been hemming and hawing for like six weeks now. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m annoying friends by constantly talking about it and changing my preference even multiple times a day. I just cannot make my mind up. So figured I’d get some advice from people that have done a lot of traveling on here. Or even people that haven’t and just have opinions! I have to make a decision soon or I’m gonna screw up and see nothing but way overpriced flights. I’m already getting close to that I feel like.

Any thoughts or help making a decision or advice on the act of making a travel decision, which never used to be this hard I’m not sure why I’m torturing myself this year, is appreciated!",40,5,3829,673,1
Should I buy down points on my mortgage?,"Should I buy points on my mortgage?

I’m buying a new build and I got 50000 in incentives towards either buying down points or paying down principle

50000$ buy down = 4.75% rate

Paying down principle = 5.5% (technically)

Does that means mortgage rates will be around 4-5%?

Feeling overwhelmed - Process of turning basement into additional unit (commercial)?,"I own a 4 unit, mixed use building. Its 2 residential units (top floor), 2 commercial units (ground floor). The building also has a walk-out basement that is fully finished (2 entrances/exits), but unoccupied. The building was built in the 1930s. I am very confused about how to go about turning the basement unit into another legally rentable commercial unit for the building?

  
Where do I even begin?

  
Areas of confusion are; 



certificate of occupancy. This CofO, its issued for the entire building, not for each individual units in the building? If thats the case, to add another ""unit"" to the building I would need to get a new CofO that specifies the basement as an additional unit suitable for occupancy? Is this a correct undestanding? OR do I pursue a seperate CofO just for the basement unit itself?

  
Building code, fire code, and grandfathering. The basement, for the most part, meets the current (2024) building code requirements for minimum ceiling height. However it has beams, ducts, and pipes, that at specific points reduce the ceiling height to below the current building code requirements. However, the building was built back in the 1930s and code then was much different than now obviously. Does this mean these code ""violations"" are likely just grandfathered in and therefore not an issue UNLESS we were to completely rennovate the basement (which we will not do as its already in great condition).

  
How do I know if i can have this basement unit become a ""legally"" rentable commercial unit for my building? What is the step by step process for making this happen? Assuming no intention of doing any rennovations as the unit is already in suitable finished condition. How do I determine what aspects of building/fire code would the unit absolutely have to comply with? Should I hire an independent commercial inspector to come in and tell me what things would need to be brought up to code? OR, should I instead have the city itself send an inspector and have him tell me what needs to be brought up to code to get a CofO issued for the unit?

  
Sorry if I seem all over the place here, just struggling to understand the process and would appreciate anyone with insight on this to give me a step-by-step process of how I move forward with figuring this out.",84,11,2293,399,0

HoA is destroying me! Help!!,"So I bought a condo this past March in Massachusetts, there is an HoA. Its roughly 600/month. The housing complex has been here since the late 80's.

There is no basement  or attic as it is one floor single family dwelling within the hoa.  we think the culprit is the carpeting and possibly the sub floor. We are in the process of getting quotes for the remediation but there is very little about online about smuts.   My questions are as follow:

Would this type of mold cause a VA assesor to fail as it's not visual? (you can smell the cat that use to live there but their is no visual mold) I've tried googllng how assesors do their testing and it's not showing much.

If it didn't fail the va assesment, could we still walk and not lose our earnest money?

Because it is a sellers market , we had to go over asking and the sellers agent is saying they have other offers that are giving comparable offers with out an inspection so they are reluctant to negotiate  doing any work to the house. Should we ask for mold remediation prior to closing? We are slated to close october 28th.  Our inspection window closes tuesday (this has been extend once already). And do we have any rights to ask under what conditions the remediation should be done. Like What if they want to remediate with out pulling the carpet? is that foolish?

Now that they know there is mold do they to disclose it other potential sellers? How much does this type of mold remediation cost? Lastly, if we wanted is it an option to ask the bank to hold the remediation money in escrow and get the loan approved?

We've learned a lot from this process and there's a lot I wouldn't do again but we really want this house but my husband and I are both immunocompromised.  We can't go back in time - so telling what we should done won't be helpful but advising what we should do going forward would be much appreciated.",51,9,2058,381,0
FIL needs out of Trailer mortgage with Ex,"My FIL recently split with his girlfriend who he owned a trailer with. The break up was/is messy. It was on land that he owned solely. He did not want to keep the trailer, he wanted to let her keep it to be able to downsize and also cut off all connection with her. Mortgage company stated she would have to sign off in order for him to remove his name from the mortgage. She has made it clear she will not sign anything. Well a couple days ago he went back to his land and she had removed the trailer. While on one hand he’s happy she did the work of removing it from his property considering he wanted to start over with a smaller trailer, she’s still refusing to have his name removed from co-owning it. Per her texts she just wants to reconcile so we believe this is the only tie she has to attempt that. How do we go about getting him off this mortgage?

Did my real estate tell me the wrong information?,"Hello,

I'm a first time home buyer and my real estate agent for the most part has been great to work with. However, after purchasing the house a couple of weeks ago it looks like there might have been a couple of things she told us incorrectly.

For instance, I asked if the garage storage which is bolted on top of the garage would be staying as well as the tv mount. Instead of telling us since they're nailed to the house they would be staying (contract only stated Tesla charger and personal belongings would be removed) she asked the sellers agent and then told us they would be removed. 

It looks like there's also other things they removed from the house leaving a lot of places to patch up. Is this something I should bring up to my agent, especially since it's been a couple of weeks since closing? Or should I just move on.

Travel companions and learned helplessness?,"Have you ever traveled with someone who’s well-informed and confident in their everyday life, but becomes weirdly complacent as soon as they go somewhere else? For example, not looking up basic stuff like time zone, cash vs card use, electrical outlets, and currency(??) before they leave the country? And they expect to just be kind of carried along like a kid whose parents are taking them to Disneyworld, or else they are shocked (shocked!) when things don’t operate exactly like they do at home?

I have a feeling that because everyone has smartphones, we feel like we don’t have to prepare a lot in advance because we  can always look it up if we need to. The problem is when some people feel so secure in this that they just…don’t. 

Anyway, it’s ultimately a very low-stakes complaint, and it’s also on me for not asking more detailed questions in advance about how my companions like to prepare for a trip. If people start treating me like their unpaid trip coordinator/mom in the future, I think I’ll just shrug and pretend and pretend I’m out of data.",43,5,1061,186,1

Single-Entity Ownership HOA rules?,"Hello!

I’m in the process of buying a condo in an 8-unit HOA as a first-time homebuyer. We recently received a decline letter from our lender (conventional loan) due to a single-entity owning more than 2 units, which is prohibited for Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac loans. 

https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/sel/b4-2.1-03/ineligible-projects

We fixed this, though, because an “investor” who already owns 1 unit will now be closing on 2 additional units after us, instead of before us, which salvaged our financing. However we learned that no lender would be able to approve financing for the condo with a single entity owning the 3 units. If relevant, this is in MT, USA.

We don’t see the condo as our forever home and plan to sell in ~7-10 years. Is there any way we can sell the condo in the future? Should we back out of the contract because of this?",34,4,851,141,0

3 week US road trip ideas,"Hey all, am hoping to get some route suggestions for a 3 week road trip in 2026 from Chicago - New Orleans/Dallas or Kansas City (at a pinch). 

Firstly, I'm travelling with 2 women who insist we take in the bridges of Madison County - I see these are best visited in Spring . Was thinking of doing the Indy 500 as well and also want to try to squeeze in Memphis/New Orleans and either Dallas or Kansas City (probably prefer Dallas?) for the Fifa Football World Cup (games in these cities scheduled around 14-17 June). Would love to make it to the F1 grand prix in Austin, Texas on 21st June but this may be pushing things.

  
Will most likely hire decent size SUV for the trip and stay in bnb's or the like along the way. Not necessarily attracted to big cities - happy to go off the highway to find local gems along the way.

Is this just how it is?,"So I’ll do my best to keep this short…

We have outgrown our current house that we bought in 2017. Thanks to the increase in home prices we have a nice chunk of equity in our home that we can use for a down payment on a bigger place. 

We’ve gone through the usual buying and selling process up to this point. Pre approval, got our house on the market, toured homes, put in an offer on a home we like, got an offer on our home etc. 

We were initially going to go with a conventional loan on the new home, but due to some things that came up throughout the process we are now going FHA. 

We are now 3 weeks out from closing. We’ve done our inspection on the new home. The buyers of our home did their inspection. ROCs have been signed and we are getting ready move on to appraisals. 

Well this morning our mortgage guy calls and says “hey, we can’t do FHA on that house due to the 90 day flip rule.” The seller of this home is an investor and moved the home from one LLC to another before putting it on the market. So now we are being told instead of closing in 3 weeks, it’s going to be pushed until the end of December. 

My question is, why wasn’t this caught earlier? This seems like something that should’ve been reviewed before parties agreeing to move forward with FHA. 

We explored going back to the conventional loan route, but the debt-to-income ratio is like right on the line and I’d have to pay off some debt at closing and it puts the closing cost just outside of what we can afford. 

If that wasn’t enough of a hurdle. About an hour later the mortgage calls again and says he reviewed one of my documents I submitted and that it says there is a lien on my current home and that we won’t even be able to sell it so the whole deal is most likely off. To clear this up, our family went through something tragic, one of my loans defaulted and I was served papers. We went to mediation, reach an agreement and I’ve been making payments since. In the document about the repayment plan that I sent to the mortgage guy it mentions that a lien “could be” issued but never was. I even confirmed this with my attorney. So he’s jumping to conclusions and now saying he needs to look into mortgage guidelines and see if we are even eligible for a mortgage. Again, why wasn’t this caught and brought into question earlier??

So all that to ask the question in the title. Is catching things like this at this stage normal? And shouldn’t these things be looked into by the real estate agents and title companies and not the mortgage company? Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated. We are feeling defeated at the moment. ",23,6,2638,498,0

What's the logic for vegetarian special meals on flights??,"After yet another flight with a subpar special meal, I need to understand once and for all the logic behind how the airline (or is it the crew?) decides what meals to serve, specifically for lacto-ovo vegetarians.

I don't eat meat or fish, but I very much love eggs and cheese. Yet, time and time again, despite requesting a lacto-ovo meal, I get what closely resembles vegan food. It's usually some grains with veggies, vegan-friendly desert and sometimes even vegan butter. I have tried getting the Indian meal and that's been hit or miss with the quality too.

What's interesting, though, is that most airlines now offer a choice of at least 2 dishes during their regular service - one of which is usually vegetarian - with much better-looking starters, mains and desserts. I'd say I regret ordering the special meal 8 times out of 10 these days and only do it on the off chance that this specific flight won't have a veggie option.

My question is - why do they even bother giving someone who has requested an LOV meal something different to what's served in the standard service in this situation? I'd totally prefer just eating some pasta and real cheese instead of a dry bed of rice and some steamed veggies. It just seems not worthwhile for the airline to go through the trouble of giving someone a special meal that's more restrictive diet-wise when there's a meal that perfectly fits their criteria already available.

I'm sure everything has a reason, but it just seems so odd to me!

EDIT: to clarify - I don’t feel entitled to the exact meal I ordered or any special treatment. As someone with a dietary restriction who travels to many meat-heavy countries, I’m very used to finding something I can eat and enjoying it. I just wanted to see if there was a rhyme or reason to why special meals are the way they are so that I could adapt better.

An experience in Texas this week with new rules,"Saw a listing for a lakehouse on Zillow. Called the LISTING agent.   I’m an attorney and I’ve done more real estate closings than most realtors, so I did not want or need a buyer’s agent. However, I retired last year and I had not kept up with the rule changes. 

Anyway, when I called the LISTING agent, I was called back by an associate in the listing agent’s office who started talking to me about the property. I assume I’m dealing with the person I’ll be negotiating against. Then he offers to be my agent. 

Dual agency is illegal in Texas, but the workaround is that a brokerage can have one agent act as a seller’s agent and one act as a buyer’s agent. It’s still usually a stupid idea rife with conflicts that makes the industry look terrible, but again, I (incorrectly) assumed I wasn’t paying this guy directly, I was already fine with the asking price, and I can look out for myself. I figured at least he had a quick line of communication to the seller’s agent since she probably signs his paychecks. 

“My” agent had no idea what he was doing, but I didn’t care - he got me in to see the property. He did not have me sign any agreement before that happened, which is apparently against the new rules. 

So I informed him I wanted to offer full asking price, and I told him it would be a cash deal. No contingencies for financing. 

He tried to talk me out of offering full asking, and he eventually succeeded. But 20 minutes after I leave the property, he tells me there has been another offer. Again, I’ve signed no agreement with him, I’ve made no formal offer. He says the offer is $2k under asking, so maybe I should offer full asking. 

I honestly assumed this was a lie that his boss (ie, the seller’s agent) told him to tell me, but since I’d wanted to offer full asking anyway, I told him to draw it up. 

Then he sends me his buyer’s agreement and that’s when I got up to speed on the new rules. 

What it said was that I would be responsible for paying 3%, but he assured me that really he was getting 2% from the seller’s agent (ie, his boss, lol). And I’d only be paying 1% cash. 

I told him if that’s the case, let’s put that in writing, and I drafted a provision that would allow him to get 3% but only obligated me to 1%. 

Obviously, at this point I’m irritated. I wanted to deal with the seller’s agent directly and I have this dumbass in the way. And now I have to pay him just to get an offer drawn up. But I’m in a conference all week, it was time sensitive, and against my better judgment, I signed the buyer’s agreement. 

Then he sent me the contract offer to sign. It had a million mistakes and omitted information, so I fixed those documents and signed them. My wife (co-buyer) had NOT signed them yet when I get a call from “my” agent who now informs me that there is a better offer. 

Ok, so before my offer is even signed by my wife, he’s telling me that somebody else has offered a better deal than full asking for cash. Why would somebody do that unless (a) he informed them about my offer which wasn’t even an offer yet; or (b) he’s just lying to get me into a bidding war with myself to drive the price up so that the broker gets a larger pie to slice up. 

This is when I told him I was not comfortable - he had conflicts, I didn’t feel like he was on my team, and I’d only deal with the seller’s agent directly. 

He sent me a document to terminate the buyer’s agreement and the deal is dead, because the seller’s agent won’t call me back. 

So I’m just posting for thoughts. If everything that happened here is totally normal and cool, then the real estate industry is more messed up than ever in my opinion. ",47,9,3659,702,0

Commercial/Residential Appraisal won't go Residential ,"The quick and dirty, I'm looking into a property that is zoned commercial/residential. The property started as a commercial space, was then appraised and sold as a residential space, then sold again and appraised as a commercial space.

American Food Made Me Sick When I Returned From Overseas,"Tl;dr After living abroad for many years I noticed when returning to America the food made me sick. Anyone with a similar experience? 

This happened to me twice over the course of 10 years. When I was 20 years old (2010) I moved to South Korea via orders from the US Army. The food there was definitely fresher. When you went out to eat food was freshly prepared. I felt healthier when I lived there. A large soda was like a 12oz cup. Portions were better controlled. I lived there for two years before returning to the US. When I came back I felt it in my gut immediately. Everything I ate would give me digestive issues. I’d frequent the Asian store to grab some foods I was familiar with and for the fresh kimchi. It took me months before I was use to some of the American food again. 

Flash forward to 2016, I received orders via the US army again, this time to Germany. I lived in Germany for three years. The food by far was some of the freshest I ever tasted. The milk especially. I’ve always loved milk, but after having German milk...I mean it’s the best. I had a local butcher in the village I lived in. They cut fresh meat daily, and a grocery store with fresh vegetables. I’m sure in larger cities there is more of an abundance of processed foods, but I lived in a smaller village. Anyways, I moved back to America in 2019. Ever since, everything makes me sick. I can taste like a chemical taste on some of the bread and meat products. This taste makes me not want to eat anything. I didn’t have it when I came back from South Korea. I’m not sure why now? It’s been a year since I’ve been back, and I don’t get as sick as I use to. I still get sick over the food though, and the taste thing is still prevalent.

7 Nights for San Francisco and Los Angeles?,"Hey,

I am undertaking a multi-city US tour from Toronto and I was hoping to add San Francisco and Los Angeles to my itinerary in this particular order:  

Boston (2 nights), NYC (7 nights with a day trip to Washington DC), Las Vegas (5 nights with trips to the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam), San Francisco (2 or 3 nights), Los Angeles (4 or 5 nights), and Chicago (3 nights).

I will be flying from NYC to Las Vegas and then, hopefully, from Las Vegas to San Francisco. 

How many nights should I allocate for San Francisco and Los Angeles? I'm thinking of the following:

**San Francisco:**

Day 1: Arrive from Las Vegas, hotel check-in, city tour including the Golden Gate Bridge, dinner somewhere with a view of said Golden Gate Bridge

Day 2: Yosemite and Giant Sequoias Hike Group Tour

Day 3: Road trip. Rent a car and drive towards Carmel-By-The-Sea and Monterry or undergo a Napa Valley tour. 

**Los Angeles:**

Day 1:  Fly in from San Francisco, pick up a rental car from Los Angeles airport, hotel check-in, scenic drive to Malibu and Santa Monica

Day 2: Hollywood Heights, Beverely Hills, Venice Beach, Sunset Strip  

Day 3: Theme park visit (what would you recommend picking?), along with other LA attractions (Griffith Obsevatory, Warner Brothers Studio Tour)

Day 3: Road trip to Irvine for a family visit

Day 4: Road trip to San Diego (I enjoy driving)

What are your opinions on the above? Should I exclude either or both San Francisco and Los Angeles? It would be a waste to do so since Las Vegas is so close to both cities.

**Lender:** United States Department of Agriculture – Rural Housing Service  
**Mortgage Date:** December 2, 1998  
**Maturity Date:** December 2, 2031  
**Mortgage Amount:** $80,775.00  
**Monthly Payment:** $475.52  
**Interest Rate:** 6.125%  
**Foreclosure Balance:** $168,358.27 (+ $13.13 per diem, attorney fees &amp; court fees)  
**Current Estimate of House:** $190,000.00 (Based on internet search)

From the Summons and Complaint filed by the lender:  
""...there is now due and owing and unpaid Note and Mortgage the **principal amount of $78,264.42, plus accrued interest from February 2, 2018 through April 30, 2024, in the amount of $29,931.20, plus subsidy granted in the amount of $43,214.84, plus late charges in the amount of $318.03, plus escrow impounds in the amount of $2,12.48, plus advanced property preservation and escrow in the amount of $14,505.30, for a total balance of $168,358.27**, together with pre-judgement interest at per diem of $13.13, with reasonable sum as attorney’s fees and costs of this action.""  


Based on information from the mortgage, this loan was granted pursuant to 42 USC §§ 1490A. In which I found the following...

**42 USC §§ 1490A**  
Title 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE  
CHAPTER 8A - SLUM CLEARANCE, URBAN RENEWAL, AND FARM HOUSING  
SUBCHAPTER III - FARM HOUSING  
Sec. 1490a - Loans to provide occupant owned, rental, and cooperative housing for low and moderate income, elderly or handicapped persons or families.

  
Ok... Here are my questions...

1. Should we contact the lender to let them know of her death?  
2. Is there a chance the lender would work with her father to see if there is a way to ""save"" the mortgage/become in good standing again? Maybe by paying the accrued interest and then resume regular payments?  
3. If so and he goes through probate and takes over the mortgage, would he have to pay subsidy right then? Or when he sells the house? (There is a subsidy agreement on her promissory note.)  
3. Is there no point and we should just let it foreclose and not file probate? (The deceased had nothing else other than her home.) 



Long story short... My goal here is to see if the mortgage can be saved, so he could sell it after probate was finalized to have him a nice nest egg to live on.  But, my gut tells me there's no point and to just let the foreclosure happen.

Talk me out of buying a house on a hill,"So, wife wants a bigger home. We start browsing Redfin, and one thing leads to another. We find this absolutely amazing 40+ year old property on a hill. 180 degree views.  Nautral light everywhere. Decks galore. Entertainers paradise. It has been completely redone, so nothing more to do. Perhaps add a pool somewhere.

  
The drive up on a single lane road doesn't worry me, and neither do the stairs. The horror stories of houses on hills do. This is in California, so wildfires and risks of earthquake are real; high rains the past few years mean that we don't know how the soil is. Given that the house has been completely remodeled, do not know if issues have been masked. Online reports scare me that soil reports, structural engineer reports don't mean much and that one should see the house at least past one wet season before knowing of any drainage issues...and I frankly know little about construction. Estimating insurance is a challenge...  


We love the views and the house though and can imagine living here for a long time. Is the only rational decision to step away? Or is there a legitimate way to assess the risk and factor that into the purchasing process?",39,10,1177,208,0

What are the pros/cons of a mortgage loan with a higher interest rate and no PMI vs. a lower rate with PMI?,"Hello! 

I’m new here and maybe should be posting in explain to me like I’m 5… 

I’m applying for loans and Schools First gave me a few options. First, 5.75% with PMI or second, 6.125% with no PMI

Both would give me relatively the same monthly payment and overall cost. 

Could someone explain the pros/cons of these? 

I’m wondering if no PMI is better because I could potentially refinance in the future?? I don’t know please share your opinions :)

Buyers asking for money on as-is item from inspection - advice?,"Update: we offered to have the carpet fixed but ultimately they found a house they liked better so said there wasn’t anything we could offer to make them stay 

So the carpet in the bedroom closet got ripped up by our cat. We listed the carpets as as-in in the contract. After the inspection, the ONLY thing the buyers requested was a credit toward fixing the carpet. Our realtor replied and said per the contract the carpet is as-is so we won’t be providing credit. Since then, they haven’t said anything and haven’t sent any other requests. (We would be happy to give credit for anything else that makes sense)

Our realtors have tried following up with them and they haven’t responded. Our realtor is of the belief that since they aren’t responding and didn’t ask for anything legit from inspection, they have basically accepted the inspection and we’re proceeding toward closing. 

I’m obviously not an expert but everything I’ve read online states that we have to come to an agreement by the end of this negotiation period or the contract is dead. In my head that’s what the buyers are thinking, because why else would they not respond? At the very least wouldn’t they ask about closing or something? I’m anxious. Any thoughts? ",63,11,1233,214,0

I  need travel destination ideas for a memorable trip with my grandparents. My grandfather was just diagnosed with mild Parkinsons. I don't know how long he will be able to travel as that progresses.  ,"**About travelers**:

My partner and I LOVE nature and eco-tourism, especially when it is related to the ocean and coral reefs.  I also love to go to unusual places or things off the beaten path. It doesn’t have to be the whole destination as long as there are some unique things to do. 

My grandparents are getting pretty old, so they don’t do any really do physically demanding activities, although they are still very active. This trip is significant because I don’t know how long my grandfather will be able to travel due to his new diagnosis. All of us love museums and learning about the history and culture of where we are. We are also a family of foodies. 

   **Travel preferences:**

My grandparents aren’t super adventurous when comes to locations. They don’t really want to go to Asia. I am trying to convince them to consider South America. But that’s problem unlikely.

Currently, he would still be able to do a river cruise, especially with a cane. He doesn’t have a tremor but  does have some balance issues. I have a compromised immune system, so I can’t go to countries with large outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as India. 

My grandparents have a significant amount of Marriott points to pay for this, but they would prefer to use up the two weeks from their timeshare. If we have to use Marriott points, that's okay. If we don’t do a river cruise, we have to stay at a Marriott. All of the available destinations are online. If it says “ Marriott vacation club,” it’s part of the timeshare system.

Regarding budget, I want to keep the lodging under 3500 a person. If it’s a river cruise, I can probably get up to 4k per person, but that’s a stretch. Obviously, the cheaper, the better, but it still needs to be special. We are only interested in river cruises, and we prefer Viking. But we are open to other companies if they have boats like Viking and the price is right. 

 If you have gone somewhere that you think would be a good choice please tell me about it. I appreciate everyone helping with this. ",201,37,2036,358,1

How to setup a trip through the Pacific Northwest in August with a toddler,"We are a couple with a 3 year old kid and I’m in charge of suggesting an itinerary for a trip next August. 

We are from Europe and I’m a bit tired of the sunny/hot/beach combo that was most adapted to holidays with a young child. So I’m looking into going to the Pacific Northwest and having a 3-week trip to Seattle, Portland and the neighboring parks and beaches.

I am at a loss though because I had always thought my first trip to North America would be to New York or LA, so I don’t have much info about the Northwest and what can be done there, even less so with a young child. 


So I have a ton of questions :

1. The flight shouldn’t be an issue as he’s quite fond of airplanes and car travel, but once there, would we find good activities to do with him?

2. I read that the weather was moderate during August, would it allow for day-long outdoor activities ?

3. Should I set up the itinerary around the cities and do everything on day trips or would it be better to change accommodations and stay closest to the Parks for example ?

4. Are the restaurants worth it and affordable or would it be better to just cook most of our meals ?

5. We typically go for apartment rentals as we prefer to have enough space and at least one separate room for our son. How is the Airbnb scene in the area, especially if we venture outside the cities ?

Thank you very much. I’m open to any further suggestions or tips.

USA - Looking for recommendations for early Dec travel with my parents,"My parents are slightly old, but they love to walk, and want to spend time with my 1.5 yr old daughter. I have a week off in early Dec, and I thought we'd do a fun trip together. 

I would love any recommendations, but here are some things to help narrow down -

* They've been to CA, WA, FL, VT, and Oregon quite a few times, so would prefer something else
* They prefer smaller towns over very big cities
* They are not big fans of snow. Chilly weather is fine, but if there's a high likelihood of snow, we'll probably avoid that. I know this limits us to mostly the South
* Small drives (2-3 hours) is ok, but we wouldn't want our trip to be very drive focussed (think: Pacific Coast highway). The toddler doesn't do well in cars
* We prefer to keep it domestic

"Bank appraisal came back substantially lower, what to expect?","Backstory. Buying a home. Beautiful home and property, newer, well maintained, no problems, 15 acres, a pond, new barn, but rural in the middle of nowhere. Originally the sellers listed for 700k, but it was on the market for 5 months with no bites. They lowered the asking price to 600k, still no bites, until we came along. 

We didn't care that it was so rural away from everything, but our agent felt it was still a bit overvalued, so we offered 550k, which seems completely fair, because if you moved this house and property only 10 miles closer to civilization, you'd be paying this or double. The sellers weren't happy at that price, but they accepted because they are motivated to sell (they built a new house they are moving to and need this one sold).

We are putting $125k down on the mortgage, so we will have roughly a $425k mortgage.

Anyway, bank appraisal came back, and they value the house at only $350k, $200k less than the offer price. The reason being because two factors:

1. The rural nature of the home, the appraiser can't really find any comparables nearby. There were only 3 other homes that sold in the last 13 months within the radius, and only 1 was similar in bedrooms and baths and square footage, but in our opinion was a run down dump.

2. The home we are buying has a separate inlaw apartment about 1000SF with a full bath and bedroom, but because it doesn't have a stove or hookup for a stove, the appraiser is not considering this living space and not factoring it into the total square footage like the sellers did on the MLS listing.


Has anyone else run into this before?

Our agent says this can work in our favor because we could now offer them far less for the home, but I'm worried they won't bite and might back out. They are motivated to sell, but already weren't too happy they were getting 150k less than what they originally wanted.",61,9,1881,337,0

New Zealand November Itinerary,"We’re traveling as an extended family of 6 -- 5 adults + 1 toddler -- to New Zealand for 2 weeks in late November and early December. So far we’ve only booked our international flights: flying into Auckland on day 1 and departing from Christchurch on day 16. One person is flying in from Sydney and the rest of us from the West Coast of the US. We’re going to rent an 8-seater people mover to get around. Since we have the toddler with us, long hikes or intense adventurous activities are out. We're also trying to avoid too many one-night stops/repacking with less driving in one day, since that'll probably also be rough on a toddler.

Seeking feedback on this itinerary: 

* Day 1: Arrive early, rest, and explore the city. Overnight in Auckland.
* Day 2: More Auckland or a day trip somewhere. Overnight in Auckland.
* Day 3: Do a Hobbiton tour. Overnight in Rotorua (or Matamata if it’s an early Hobbiton tour). 
* Day 4: Explore Rotorua. Overnight in either Rotorua or Taupo.
* Day 5: Long driving day to Wellington. Overnight in Wellington.
* Day 6: Explore Wellington. Overnight in Wellington.
* Day 7: Fly to Queenstown and explore town. Overnight in Queenstown.
* Days 8 - 10: Coach-cruise or fly-cruise tours to Milford Sound, day trips to Glenorchy or Wanaka. Overnights in Queenstown.
* Day 11: Drive towards Mount Cook and Lake Tepako. Overnight in Mount Cook or Lake Tepako.
* Day 12: Explore Mount Cook and Lake Tepako. Overnight in Mount Cook or Lake Tepako.
* Day 13: Drive to Christchurch. Overnight in Christchurch.
* Day 14-15: Explore Christchurch and day trip somewhere. Overnight in Christchurch.
* Day 16: Fly home.

Some outstanding questions we have:

* Any recommendations for an Auckland day trip for day 2?
* Any recommendations for a Christchurch day trip for day 14 or 15?
* For days 11 and 12, is it easier to find accommodation for 6 at Mt. Cook or Lake Tepako?

Finally, the activity we want to do but can’t easily fit into the itinerary is the TranzAlpine train. Some thoughts we had on how to fit this in:

* Do a roundtrip daytrip from Christchurch on the TranzAlpine on Day 14 or 15, which seems redundant. This seems the easiest, and not everyone in our party needs to commit to the train day.
* Go up the West Coast from Queenstown towards Greymouth, drop the car off, then train to Christchurch on day 12 or 13. This would unfortunately mean missing Mt. Cook/Lake Tepako or having to backtrack to visit it.",30,4,2448,419,1

Flight Cancellation - Re-imbursement of Expenses and Compensation Question,"I am a Canadian traveller who was in Venice.

On September 21, 2024, I was informed by email at 7:00PM that my flight was cancelled with RyanAir flight number FR782. The flight was supposed to flyout September 24, 2024 which is less than 7 days notice. The flight cancellation was due to a third party strike.

As I am a Canadian, I was unable to phone RyanAir to find a new flight without incurring roaming charges and when I saw the cancellation email that same evening, RyanAir customer service was closed. I then rebooked a flight using an alternative airline that costed double the price of my original flight as this was the most reasonable flight out of Venice that I could find under short notice.

I have read the EU airline passenger regulations. I understand that the flight was cancelled due to a third party strike so I am not entitled to any compensation, however, I am unclear if RyanAir is required to reimburse me for the new flight booked. I have not requested a refund yet from RyanAir. It says that RyanAir is supposed to find alternative arrangements, but if they are unable to, then I am required to find the arrangements and submit expenses for reimbursement, however, as I did not contact RyanAir first, am I only entitled to have a refund of the original RyanAir flight?",74,9,1295,227,1

Sellers lied about solar panels being paid off and now refusing any solution,"UPDATE: 9/27/24
they are now trying to give us only 3k credit. Opinions?
—————————————————————————————

(from Long Island, NY) We are first time home buyers in the worst situation. The contract is already signed and the seller always told our agent that the solar panels were paid off.
Turns out they lied and there was a lien on the home and the panels went into bankruptcy because they couldn't afford them. They were leased to own so they had to pay monthly till they own them. To outright buy the panels it's 14k. (a ucc3 was filed and the LIEN IS REMOVED)

Mind you they are 10 years old. Why would we want additional debt on old panels.

We don't know what to do, they refuse to credit us in any way. The contract has been signed and we don't want to lose our deposit of 50k because they outright lied about owning the panels. Also in our contract it says

""60. (delete if not applicable) In the event there are currently solar panels installed on the house the buyers) agree to take the premises in its existing condition and will assume the responsibility of the monthly payments for the duration of the contract under its current terms and conditions and/or Lease Transter Agreement. If the title company requires a OCC Financing Statement Amendment (Form UCC3) to be file prior to closing to clear any existing liens subject to the solar panels, the buyer agrees to sign any documents required by the solar panel company to effectuate said transfer of the existing contract into the buyer's name.”

the lawyer and my agent told us that this is normal since we want to own them, and we didn't think much of it since we were told they were paid off.

After weeks of arguing with the sellers my lawyer emailed me the attached. What should we do?

Email:

This is the current scenario...
1. To payoff the panels, and own them outright, the price would be around $14,500
2. To payoff the next year service would be around $6,500
3. If you chose not to utilize the service and activate the panels, your cost would be $0 (you could remove the panels at any time without a fee to Sunrun)
I suspect that in the very near future, the seller will issue a Time of the Essence letter and try to force us to close.
At that time, our options would be the following:
1. Agree to close and elect one of the options above, or,
2. Reject the TOE, under the argument that they misrepresented the balance and costs of the panels.
If you choose the 2nd option, they would likely seek to default us and liquidate the deposit. You would then have to initiate a legal action to dispute their claim.
I cannot guarantee how a court would decide this, but I can tell you that it would be time consuming and costly.
I have informed the seller's attorney that you do not desire to pay anything to Sunrun. I suggested that they issue a credit to you. They have refused.

We are at an impasse.




EDIT:

this is the current correspondence between the lawyers 

Lance- my lawyer

Gerri - sellers lawyer.


Gerri: 
Lance,
Your client signed a contract agreeing to assume the balance of the solar contract. I’m not aware of the discussions that took place between the parties, however Buyer should not be relying on any representations made by the agents or the sellers and are responsible for doing their own due diligence. 
Additionally, the solar panels were not operating at the time of contract, which is the same condition they are in now. 

If the seller owned them outright, then there wouldn’t be a monitoring or servicing agreement, so your client would still be responsible for purchasing a plan. 

Additionally, sun run advised that your client has continuously stated that they want nothing to do with the solar panels  

What is the resolution your client is looking for here? 

Lance:
I’ve said this several times. 

They do not want to accept these panels with any balance due upon them, as was represented to them. 

Your client can provide a credit to the buyers for the cost of the panels, which would put the buyers in the position that they would have been if your client’s representations were accurate. 

They want nothing more than what they bargained for. 

Gerri:

What they bargained for? What about the terms of the contract that they reviewed, signed and agreed to? 

Please clarify, is buyer requesting:
A credit for the estimated pre-payment of solar use for the remainder of the of the term which is $6184 and includes the monitoring and maintenance plan; or 
A credit for outright purchase of the equipment which is $14,187 and does not include a monitoring and maintenance plan (This is essentially what exists now at no cost to anyone since it was discharged in bankruptcy)


Lance:
Option 2.

Gerri:
Your clients are trying for a money grab at this point. The result of option 2 would put them in the same situation as presently exists. Solar panels on roof with no monitoring or maintenance contract. 

Lance:
Or, would allow them to renew the contract, pay the service fees, and utilize the panels. 

They are not looking for more than they negotiated for. 

Your client can also elect to terminate this contract and return the deposit, if they wish. 


End of emails.

The only proof we have is a email from the sellers lawyer admitting that he was trying to obtain a payoff letter but found out theirs bankruptcy.

Their lawyers email:
Lance,
After not having success in obtaining the payoff and UCC3 and in further speaking with the sellers, we are advised that both the 2d mortgage and solar panels were discharged as part of a bankruptcy which sellers didn't previously disclose to us as they interpreted this to mean that both accounts were satisfied. We are requesting a lien release from BofA and have submitted a request to the bankruptcy department at Sunrun to determine what our options are to proceed. The solar agreement was a Power Purchase Agreement through 4/1/2035. Would buyer's consider assuming the solar agreement? I don't believe we will have sufficient funds to payoff the solar loan.

Seller Delayed Closing What now?,"I’ve recently gotten approved on a home in NY after offering a large sum of money above the sellers asking price. From beginning to end the process has been fairly smooth, sellers were asking if us “the buyers” were good to go 2 weeks before closing but told us to wait until they give the go ahead. We were given the go ahead, got our loan approved, rate locked, closing should’ve been the first of October.

October 1st goes by, sellers agents don’t give us a consistent answer as to when to close. Come the second week, we’re told the sellers are waiting for a reverse mortgage payoff. We were expecting a  closing by the 8th of October but doesn’t seem like it’ll happen either. 

My realtor and attorney are in the dark. We call everyday and don’t get a legit response. 

What is your expert take on this?
Will the home actually close?

There’s no contingencies in place that say it wont. 
Sellers are delaying without giving us an accurate date or even acknowledging an extension. 

My rate lock expires on the 10th, 3 days from now. 
I’ll have to pay out of pocket for an extension, can this be reimbursed from the seller?

I have tons of questions, becoming inpatient since we’ve told our current landlord we’re moving out the end of the month.

How often do homes check all the boxes?,"I recently moved from California to MA. I was very spoiled in that my California home really was my “dream” home.

We now are looking at homes in MA. Finding ourselves either looking at:

1. great bones, amazing wow/take your breath away architecture but a lot of remodeling (kitchen gut/bathrooms/paint/deck).
2. being at a very top of budget to check all boxes
3. A really nice home that needs some work but besides location being on a different side of town than we want (nothing wrong with part of town it is in) it is really very nice and checks all other boxes and well within budget.

Advice Buying Home With Partner,"Hi all!

FIRE practitioner here but wanted to see if I could gauge some advice or steps from folks in this Reddit on how to go about a situation.

A little about me: I mortgage an investment property in Florida, it's not paid but I've been able to dock a fair bit of money into it and while the property is losing money technically it is nearly balanced in the rent and cost of it.  I debated selling it last summer but because the market is very saturated I had trouble and the offers I got were just plain ludicrous so hoping the market comes back there. Not putting anymore into it than I need to currently in case I end up taking a hit on the equity as it's in flux at the moment. I've been saving a lot and am looking to invest in a place of my own.

**More importantly,** I've been in some bad relationships so I know the ins and outs of what to look for in a partner, but am currently in a very good one.  Trial and error, therapy, etc have led me to a good partner I've been seeing for 2 years I moved into her place in Rhode Island a year ago, and love the home. 

My partner mortgages the home, is gainfully employed and is getting her Master's.  She is driven but as we know wages sometimes outpace the cost of living. In short, she can afford the home but is ""house-poor"". She bought it with an ex-husband who signed it away to her at the divorce (lucky!). I do pay her rent but we prorated a lot of that to her to pay off credit card debts and now she is debt-free. In short, I've been helping her also become Financially independent with no debt etc.

It's a long journey for her but **I'd like to buy half the equity in her house.  She needs to refinance this summer anyway according to the agreement upon her divorce, and while I pay rent I don't feel a ""stake"" in the home.  I do help out, I'm not a freeloader, we share responsibilities, I repair things, I mow, and I help a lot but for once I'd like to ""own something"".  I have enough to buy my half outright and she offered to refinance for the original loan amount with me not the new value of the house, it's a win-win for her and for me as her bills would get cut in half.**

**BUT I'm drawing dead on what the process is...where do I start? A Real Estate Lawyer, the Mortgage Lender?  Any help on the process would be great.**

  
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, We will never be getting married. We have both decided on this and are happy with that situation. Also, I told her whatever we decide she has first rights to buy the house in the event of the breakup and can buy me out for half (assuming we can write that into a contract).  I really don't care and see this as only fair as it was her home to begin with.

Deed seems to be incorrect,"I have a family deed dated 2003 that has incorrect wording that we just discovered when updating a trust.

The abstract of the title and will are 1/4 and written correctly. The other partners are in agreement on the 1/4, no problems there. The attorney who created the deed has passed. I suppose I could track down who took his place. The state is Iowa. Where would we start to get the deed wording corrected? The deed is part of a family partnership. TIA.",26,5,819,153,0
Vietnam Itinerary Help (13 Nights),"Hi, we will be in Vietnam 13th-26th October (13 nights), we had an idea on where we wanted to go and how many nights to spend in each but when it comes to actually planning it, I am not sure if we should drop Hoi An so it doesn’t feel rushed. We want to be able to relax and enjoy ourselves and not feel like we are constantly on the move. This is the plan currently:

13th: Arrive late in Hanoi
14th: Hanoi 
15th: Fly to Da Nang (night in Hoi An)
16th: Hoi An (lantern festival)
17th: Overnight train to Ninh Binh
18th: Ninh Binh (arrive in morning from train)
19th: Ninh Binh
20th: Return to Hanoi (for Ha Long next morning)
21st: Ha Long Cruise (overnight) 
22nd: Return to Hanoi (for Sapa next morning)
23rd: Sapa
24th: Sapa
25th: Hanoi
26th: Flight home (evening)

This results in a total 5 nights in Hanoi, 2 nights in Hoi An, 2 nights in Ninh Binh, 1 night in Ha Long, 2 nights in Sapa, and 1 on a train. Should we drop Hoi An since it is rainy season there and extend stays in Ninh Binh/Sapa so it doesn’t feel rushed and we have more time to relax or does this itinerary seem ok? Ideally we wouldn’t have to return to Hanoi from Ninh Binh to get to HLB but it doesn’t look like there is a bus that’s reliable enough to make sure you get there for a 2D1N cruise. We want to keep Ha Long Bay even though it may be overrated just because of how iconic it is.

What is the first thing you noticed when abroad for the first time?,"
I remember my first two international trips, the first to Mexico on a cruise ship when I was a child, and the second to Paris as an 18-year-old.

During my first trip to Mexico, I was young, ignorant, and had grown up in a very homogenous state. As we approached Mexico, I noticed the TV in our cruise ship cabin started broadcasting in Spanish. The commercials were no longer in English, and I found that fascinating. I remember seeing what I thought was a giant peninsula with a wall as we neared Progreso, and in my naivety, I assumed it was the U.S.-Mexico border. I was very unaware back then.

Paris at 18 was an entirely different experience. Stepping off the plane, I walked through the jet bridge and saw small European cars zipping around below me. It immediately struck me that I was far from home. Inside the airport, I saw French police with their distinct uniforms, which reinforced how foreign everything felt. I was traveling alone and found myself in Terminal 2E—a giant red terminal. Seeing all the alcohol for sale, I asked if I could buy some at 18, and to my surprise, they allowed it. I had a vodka and orange juice at 8 a.m., legally, and I felt like a true adult.

Shortly after landing, I boarded a nonstop flight to Marseille. The plane flew low over rural France, giving me a view of the lush, green countryside. When we arrived in Marseille, I looked out the window and was met with the sight of cerulean waters and orange-roofed buildings—a striking contrast to what I had seen before. The city felt wonderfully eclectic and vibrant. It was an incredible  experience.

Lowball Offer on Our Dream Home,"Hello! We have found our dream home in the suburbs of Vancouver, Canada. We want to make an offer, but we believe the property is extremely over priced for the area...

The sellers originally listed the house for $2.5M back in Spring 2023. This house is also a new home (nobody currently lives there). We have seen the house twice now and brought someone to do a little inspection to see why it may be sitting still after 1.5 years unsold. Everything looks ""by the book"" and nothing major stood out to them in terms of why it may be sitting unsold after 1.5 years.

We are selling our property in Vancouver and are getting most of our funds from that sale. 

We think the home isn't worth more than $2M and we would be comfortable with paying $1.8M for the home since it also requires paying GST since it's a new home. 

Is it worth putting in a ""low ball"" offer on the home since it's our dream home? What is the likelihood that they would take an offer $500+ K lower than originally priced? My realtor seems to think we shouldn't even try if it's lower than $2.3...

Is it a waste of time to put in an offer at $1.8?",31,6,1118,210,0

Backup Offers?,"Can someone explain how Backup Offers work?  We’ve had are home on the market for almost 40 days and have had some really good showings.

It says Accepting Backup Offers. What does this mean exactly?

Does it mean the potential buyer submitted a low offer and they accepted with the hopes someone else would make a higher offer? Can the seller accept a higher offer during this period?  If it is contingent on the sale of the buyers home, would our offer be stronger if we go Under Contract on our current home?",14,2,688,127,0

Where to Travel in November,"I am looking for some advice on where to travel this November. I am coming from Canada and wanting to go somewhere in Western Europe from the 10th - 24th and have narrowed it down to five possible places: Scotland, Northern Spain, Germany (Bavaria specifically), Switzerland, or Austria.

AL:Is my title company allowed to change the price of title insurance after closing?,"I'm in Alabama, and I recently sold my house. Before the sale, our title company told us the cost for the Owner's Policy of Title Insurance would be $75, and this amount was reflected on the ALTA Settlement Sheet and in an addendum we signed. Both I (the seller), the buyer, and the escrow officer signed these documents.
Now, after the sale has closed, the title company is claiming we owe $1,000 for title insurance instead of the agreed $75. They're saying they can change this amount because of the Errors and Omissions Compliance Agreement we signed. (Typed below) However, this unexpected charge brings us below the profit threshold we needed to make the sale of the house worthwhile.
Is this legal? Can they change the cost after closing despite what was listed and signed? We had a signed agreement, and this large discrepancy is significantly affecting our financial outcome.

Critique the listing + switching agent re-list strategy (US-CA),"Hello, we're at a point where the house has been on the market for a while and showings are becoming quite sparse.

3. Would it be wise to switch agent and re-list still in the dwindling fall window or just pull it for the holidays and bring it back in January?

Morocco 9-day itinerary tips,"Hi everyone! Me and my partner are going to Morocco for a 9-day trip in November (including travel days), it's our first time there and I would like some tips! It's his birthday week and we're trying to get a balance between going to a few different destinations but also not having a vacation that feels rushed. So far, I'm thinking of doing Marrakech, Essaouira and a 3-day trip to the Sahara Desert, possibly spread out like this:

  
Day 1: arrive in Marrakech around 9am, walk around Marrakech

Day 2: Marrakech

Day 3: first day of desert tour

Day 4: second day of desert tour

Day 5: third day of desert tour

Day 6: Marrakech -&gt; Essaouira

Day 7: Essaouira

Day 8: Essaouira -&gt; Marrakech

Day 9: last walk around Marrakech and fly back around 10pm

  
Alternatively, we could go to Essaouira as soon as we arrive, do Marrakech and end with the desert tour, but as my partner is quite keen on the tour, the above itinerary gives us some leeway in case anything goes wrong with the original plan. So, my main question is, does this itinerary make sense? Could we add any other place without being too rushed? Should I arrange the days any other way?

  
Then, regarding accommodation, is the best way to find affordable riads booking/hostelworld? Are there any other places I should be looking? I've seen some comments in old Reddit posts to just go and walk around and find a riad while there but I think we'd both feel a bit anxious about that honestly! 

  
And about the desert tour, I know we can find plenty of options on GetYourGuide, however, are there any good tips of specific agencies?

Mortgage Reinstated - New Close Out Letter?,"I fell on hard times and missed several mortgage payments. I received a reinstatement letter from my mortgage company and paid in full before the deadline. I have confirmed with my mortgage company that my account is in good standing &amp; have a current statement showing one month's payment is due on 10/1/24. 

The reinstatement was paid on 9/9/24 and I most recently spoke to my lender on 9/19/24. I just logged into my mortgage online account and see a new document posted to my account on 9/20/24 (nothing has come in the mail yet). The letter is another Close Out Letter from the lender. It says something about my account being behind, but doesn't list an amount. (It's identical to the original close out letter I received, which I then called to reinstate.)

I'm so confused and in a panic. I quadruple checked &amp; I paid the full amount listed on the reinstatement letter. My account is not behind. I'm going to call the lender in morning, but would love to hear opinions on why this may have happened. 

After confirming several times with my lender that my account is in good standing, I told the rep we can close out the application that I had previously started for assistance. I was told my account is up-to-date and will remain in good standing as long as I make my monthly payments each month moving forward. I won't have an issue making monthly payments moving forward. Maybe something was messed up when I closed the assistance application? I don't understand at all. ",43,7,1490,262,0

What to do if the Airline Company ls unresponsive after they lost your baggage and it has been over 35 days ?? AirSerbia - worst company ever,"On August 24th, I and my two kids were traveling back home to New York from Croatia. We were flying with Air Serbia from Pula, Croatia, and had a connecting flight in Belgrade, and the final destination was JFK, NYC.

First, Belgrade - NYC was 9 hrs long flight. All the TVs in the airplane were broken, and there was no USB outlet at the seat to charge phones or iPads - I believe every parent knows what it means for kids to be on nine a 9-hour-long flight with no electrical devices. Besides that, three toilets out of the six we had access to were broken. And the cherry on top - their catering company messed up marking the meals, so there was no way they could give you the correct meal without opening it and checking what was inside - so the entire flight was very interesting. Anyway, we landed safely, and I just wanted to go home after traveling for 17 hrs with two small kids. But the worst just started. Our two checked suitcases did not come. We filed a report at JFK as soon as we landed and headed home. I was not worried since we are frequent fliers, and it happened multiple times that our luggage was lost, but it always arrived fast without any issues ( Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Lufthansa - amazing customer service ).

I checked the Air Serbia website, and there was a claim for luggage lost over five days and over 21 days. I also got their email when we left the airport with a link where you can check the status of your bag. For the first five days, I checked daily, and every day, it was the same response - no information about your luggage. After six days and the same status on the bag tracer, I submitted my first claim and called the customer service number provided on the website. There was no response to my email, and the agent over the phone gave me three different numbers - all Belgrade locations to call regarding it, saying that "" Air Serbia is not in charge of the baggage. Instead, they are using 3rd party to handle it "". Nobody responded to any of those numbers - ever. 

Today is the 39th day that I don't have any information on what is going on or anyone reached out to me. I filled seven claims, submitted multiple expenses that this delay caused, reached out to 6 different email addresses, and wrote to their CS on Instagram, and the only response I am getting is: Due to a high volume of requests, it may take longer than expected to receive a response. Our colleagues from the reclamation service will do their best to keep your waiting time to a minimum and get back to you as soon as possible. 

I posted on my Instagram story what happened and had 13 ppl reaching out that they went through the same thing with AirSerbia :(((((/ one of my friend who is originally from Belgrade sent me an email address that is at their LOST AND FOUND office door in Belgrade ( ???? ) and after I sent an email there, they responded that my baggage was still in Belgrade ( ???? ). When I asked for additional information - nobody ever responded! Please help if you have any advice on how this could be solved. I waste so much time and energy and do not know what to do next!!

Thoughts from a broker/agent,"I’m a real estate broker in Utah and I’ve followed this thread. I love hearing stories, although it seems like there are a lot of horror stories. I had some thoughts I wanted to share… 

#1 - I always felt like, as a real estate agent, I was respected. I help people navigate what is usually the largest financial transaction of their life. In following this thread, I can see a lot of people feel like real estate agents are slimy, shady, overpaid and overall similar to a used car salesman. Yes, there are a lot of bad agents. There are agents that are not worth what they’re paid…but also, there are a lot of really good agents. Do your research! Interview multiple agents when you’re searching for someone to represent you. I feel like my job, as an agent, is to make the transaction as smooth as possible and ensure my clients are protected and their best interests are always first. I frequently use the commission I’m paid to help facilitate this. I have paid off buyers’ tax liens so they could close/qualify (they said they’d pay me back, but they never did - which is fine, I still made money). I have paid for repairs out of pocket. I have personally helped clean out houses, clean up yards, haul trash to the dump, etc. I have paid for appraisals to be rushed. Just this week, my clients were buying a home and needed a few extra days for closing. It was inconvenient for the sellers. I asked what I could do to help ease the burden - I ended up hiring a junk removal company to help clear out a shed and garage that the sellers were having a hard time. I made their life easier so they were willing to make my client’s (and my) life easier. I have reduced my commission when the appraisal came in low. I don’t say this to toot my own horn or say how awesome I am - I say it because if you’re agent isn’t going above and beyond to make the process easier for you, they should be. I get its hard/impossible to fire an agent mid-transaction, and sometimes you find out how bad of an agent you’re tied to until it’s too late. But interview lots of agents, ask them what they’ve done with other clients to ensure a smooth transaction. There are really great agents out there.

#2 - Real estate laws are VERY state specific and also VERY contract specific. It’s sometimes difficult to give good advice on here without knowing your state. Your agent should be an expert in your state. There are a lot of federal laws, but there are a multitude more state specific laws.

#3 - In most states, there are real estate brokers &amp; real estate agents. Real estate brokers are agents how have taken additional education, training and experience. Agents work under brokers. If you have a problem with your agent, don’t be afraid to involve the broker. Broker &gt; agent. Your listing agreement or buyer/broker agreement should list the broker. As a broker, if I get a call from an agent’s client, it gets my attention really quick.

#4 - Mostly everything is negotiated/negotiable. This includes commissions. There is no standard. There is no normal. Yes, typically it falls within 1-3%. There are agents who will only work for 3%. They may say “I know my worth”. Everyone is able to conduct their business how they want. Personally, I have and would never let my commission influence any decision I make in a transaction. Currently, with the recent changes, I will say: My fee is 3%. This is most commonly paid by the seller, but not always. In any offer, we will ask the seller to cover the fee. If they agree to an amount less, I’ll take whatever they’re offering and I won’t force you to cover the difference.” Every agent is different. If you aren’t satisfied with the agent’s response to commissions/compensation, keep interviewing. You will find an agent willing to work for whatever fee you’re happy paying. Yes, you could “get what you pay for”, but I think you can find really good agents that are willing to make the numbers work…. Which brings me to 5.

#5 - Are agents overpaid? Sometimes. There are transactions that go super super easy and smooth and I’ve been paid 3% and I’ve felt like my compensation far outweighed the number of hours I worked. On the flip side, there are times I’ve worked for months and month, showed 30+ homes, written 5+ offers, spent hours and hours, nights &amp; weekends, away from my family…and been paid $0. It’s part of the business. Some are easy. Some are really hard. Compensation doesn’t always align with how hard or how much I worked. Not sure what the solution is. Some agents do work on an hourly rate, some on a flat rate, and some on a percentage. Find an agent who you feel comfortable with.",28,4,4648,841,0

Received Clear to Close from Seller but not Closing until Monday but a Hurricane is Coming Wednesday ,"I’ve been in a closing that has been delayed multiple times due to the buyer switching lenders. We finally received the clear to close and final HUD-Statement. Did final walkthrough on Friday. I have personally  talked to their lender at this point who told me we have the clear to close and everything is set to close on Monday due to the title company needing time to get everything together (we got the clear to close and everything late afternoon Friday). Big problem to all of this is where directly in the cone for Hurricane Minton in Florida which is supposed to come on Wednesday.

My questions is once you get a clear to close is insurance already bonded at that point or will the Hurricane defer closing until after the Hurricane? I had the understanding that we were essentially just waiting on the title company to complete the deal and no other outstanding conditions were left but I am unsure if a hurricane can stop the close from happening even if set a couple days before it comes.

Copenhagen/Denmark/Oslo/Bergen in late June w/ Kids - Recommendations Needed,"Hi All,

Planning a family trip with the wife, and 2 kids (7 year old and 9 month old).  Looking to do the summer...fairly open June-August, was originally looking at July and August, but I did read about how July is super packed with tourists, and August is European Holiday so no that much better.  So now I am looking at late June.  Also read that everything may be closed during midsummer, so looking to head over as soon as that is done.  Currently thinking:

Arrive Copenhagen \~ June 24th, 2025   
Travel to Stockholm - June 28th, 2025

Travel to Oslo - July 2nd, 2025

Travel to Bergen - July 4th, 2025

Depart for Home on July 7th (can fly direct from Bergen back to USA, via connection in Oslo or Copenhagen so don't need to account for another separate ticket)

  
Questions I have:

1) Would you make any changes to the routing?  

2) I know the weather won't be as warm as July or August, but will it be non-pleasant in June (I know nobody can predict it, just historically)

3) Do we need a car in any place, or can we get around with public transport?

4) To minimize the amount of hotel times, can we stay in Bergen and still do day trips to experience the Fjords?

5) Flåm Railway looks amazing, how would you work that in to the above?  With 2 little kids, I imagine we will have 2 suitcases + stroller, etc.

Selling dad's house after his death,"My dad died a couple of months ago and I immediately had several people interested in buying his house. It's very small and needs a lot of work so I'm selling it ""as is""  by myself. The estate is in probate and my dad didn't have a will so I had to wait until I was made administrator to sell. 

One person looked at it before I got that and was interested. After I was made admin, I had an appraisal done by a realtor so I let a couple of other people know that I was ready to show the house. He appraised the house at 68k with the lowest I should go at 60. If I decided to have the realtor sell it, he'd list it for 79 so I went with 70 as an asking price in hopes that I'd at least get the 68. 

As I should have, I didn't let the first person that looked at it know the price for some reason, and another just that I was ready for him to see the house. However, the second person I actually showed to offered to buy for the 70 I asked and we filled out a buyer's agreement as it was the best deal I thought I'd get and I'm pretty sure of that.  As I said, the house needs a lot of work. 

I'm just trying to figure out how, or if, I need to tell these other people that I've already sold. Everything has gone so quick and I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just glad to be rid of that house that I had no desire in keeping. 

Thoughts please.

I will get a realtor but I'm unsure how negotiable a house price can be. The townhome has been on the market for 90 days and was originally listed for 630 and dropped to 600. How much do you realistically I could bid. I was thinking to offer 570 but I'm unsure if that seems like too low of an offer. I don't wanna rent a crummy apartment for a year or two only to move and have the house prices jump after interest rates lower. The Zillow estimate of the place is 585k",42,8,793,160,0
Is it worth staying in a hostel in Kuala Lumpur?,"Hey all,
I'm kicking off a solo adventure around a few spots in SEA with a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and was wondering if its worth staying in a hostel or if I should just go with a regular hotel. Price is not really an issue because I was looking at a private room in the hostel anyway and its only about $20-30 difference with respect to the hotel. In particular, I was considering the mingle hostel in Chinatown but they have a not insignificant amount of reviews about bed bugs in the dorms so that's got me a little concerned. 

My main reason for considering a hostel was more for the social aspect as opposed to saving money. And I will be staying in hostels at later destinations in my trip through Loas and Cambodia.

To travelers who have been to KL before, is it worth trying to stay in a hostel or should I just play it safe and start off in a hotel? 

Thanks in advance for all your input.",48,10,907,173,1
Would you sell your house if the only thing you disliked was the location?,"And by location I mean I usually have to travel out my neighborhood (15-30 mins away) to go to parks, venues, stores, restaurants, etc I enjoy and go to frequently. On top of that, some of my neighbors don't take care of their homes so it makes our neighborhood look really trashy even though it;'s a pretty decent area. Outside of those 2 things my house is perfect. It's in an area with the best schools in my district and I have a low mortgage rate.

Defect notice work not satisfactory ,"Should I delay closing? (Defect report)

Long story short I close in a week and the seller has completed all the fixes we asked for but there’s one specific thing that I’m not sure how to proceed on. 

On the defect notice we said that the electrical service entrance was degraded and needs REPLACED (important detail). The electrician instead wrapped it in electrical tape. Which is not what we agreed upon but it was done by a licensed electrician. 

I close in a week and I let my agent know that I wanted it brought up to see if the seller would agree to a credit so I can fix it myself. We haven’t heard back from them but I’m preparing for the worst. 

So my question is if they say no to providing me a credit what recourse do I have. They DID sign the defect notice agreeing to the fixes which stated it needed REPLACED. Is there anything I can do about it? I don’t want to walk away over this one little thing when everything else is fine, but I don’t want to get screwed over and I want them held accountable for what they agreed to do. I’m thinking of hiring a real estate attorney but I’m not sure if it’s worth it this close to close. Any relevant advice welcome!

I will give updates on the response I get from the sellers as I know more!

Best country in African for Safari? ,"Looking for potential African safari vacation for my family. Did a bit of research and so far see that the top 3 countries are Tanzania, Kenya, or South Africa. Was wondering if anyone had any experience with any of these and had any recommendations. Looking for my safari to be around a week give or take, in the summer months, so June or July. And really I just want to just see some nice wildlife. I’m also wondering if there’s any recommendations for certain national parks or game reserves. Or for specific tour guide companies/agencies. Additionally after the safari we want to go somewhere coastal we were thinking Zanzibar if we go to Tanzania, or Cape Town if we go to South Africa. I’ve heard the crime situation in South Africa is pretty bad, but I’m not sure how bad it really is because I know people (especially tourists) tend to exaggerate. I’ve been to a few third world countries already and am by no means one of those people who will avoid a country because of the crime factor, unless it’s truly really bad, (think like Syria, Somalia etc). Anyways, any recommendations will be appreciated!

Applying for Japanese eVisa on applied PGWP status.,"Earlier this year, my friends (permanent residents of Canada) and I (a recent university graduate with a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) application in process) planned a trip to Japan. We purchased non-refundable airline tickets and hotel accommodations in May, with our intended arrival in Japan on December 28th.

When we initially tried applying for an eVisa, the consulate’s website stated that applications could only be submitted within 90 days of the intended entry date. On September 29th, we submitted our applications. However, a day later, I received an email from the consulate office informing me that our applications were cancelled due to insufficient documentation.

Upon further inquiry, we were told that our itinerary lacked details and that we needed to submit an itinerary form via the consulate's website. Additionally, the email stated that my study/work permit had expired or would expire during my travels, and I was advised to reapply once my PGWP is approved. In my original submission, I included my expired study permit along with the PGWP receipt confirmation from IRCC, which seems to have been insufficient.

I have two questions:

1. My final destination is India, where I am a legal citizen (proven by my Indian passport), and my flight itinerary shows that I will depart Japan directly for India. Why should my current residency status in Canada be a concern in this situation?
2. Is there any way to resolve this with the consulate office? I have tried calling them multiple times over several days but have not been able to get through.

PS: We are residents of Whitehorse, Yukon and the closest Japanese Consulate Office we have is either Vancouver or Calgary.

The sale of my house closed yesterday, so the title company handled the payoff of my mortgage and then the rest of the money was deposited into my bank by the real estate attorney per our state’s law. It wasn’t a wire transfer but they were certified checks- as the buyer put down 20% and financed the rest through a mortgage with a known bank. Yesterday Bank of America issued a hold on the funds because there “they are likely to be returned”. Apparently the system tried to put them through at 2:30 this morning and the same message came up.

Anyone who has an “M” Visa for China…looking for some advice.,"I’ve been seeing mixed things and want to make sure I do not get denied entry to China or anything when I get there.

On the visa application, it asks if you have ever been convicted of a crime in China or any other country. 

I have an underage DUI charge (misdemeanor) from over ten years ago. 

Initially, I was going to check “Yes” and try my best to do the requirements to get a Visa if I don’t outright get rejected right away. 

Then, after talking to multiple people, the advisement is to check “No”. There is no background check to submit, and China cannot check. 

I would be lying on official Chinese documents and I would be afraid of being denied entry at the border even if I had a Visa for whatever reason.

The era of condos as a starter home in the housing market might be over ,"I posted in my local real estate forum about all the trouble I am having finding a small condo in my city. My budget is realistic, but I am finding few building are eligible for loans. 

Where I live has a ton of condos in buildings built from 1960-1980. That is most of the condo inventory. There are some patterns in these buildings:
- expensive things need to be replaced now: roofs, elevators, stucco, staircases, electrical, and plumbing 
- most buildings have a large contingent of long term owners (15+ years in the building, often longer)
- a large portion of the residents are seniors that are now fixed income, 20-30% is typical. And they don’t want to increase their expenses 
- another large portion of owners have owed long enough it is simple to have a cashflow positive rental (most building are 20-30% renters)

This means HOAs are at risk due to:
- low reserves
- costly ongoing construction projects
- high percentage of renters 

All red flags for lenders. 

This means, some buildings can only sell to cash buyers, many buildings are ineligible for FHA, VA, and other lower downpayment programs if a lender is willing to deal in the building. 

Which ends up limiting the buyers to investors, folks with equity to use for a large down payment, wealthy buyers with a lot of cash. And not so much first time home buyers trying to get started in the housing market. 

That feels pretty concerning to me. We already had the issue with boomers holding on to the homes so there aren’t starter homes.  And now it also looks like, condos, a typical starter home, is out of reach as well for many buyers.  ",72,16,1617,284,0

Dear Customer

We wanted to get in touch to extend our apologies and explain the reasoning behind the changes to your travel plans, which you will have received notice of in a recent email.

Every airline relies on its suppliers and manufacturing partners to ensure it is able to maintain its aircraft so that they can operate as planned. Safety is always the number one priority.  Unfortunately, Rolls-Royce, our engine supplier for our fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft, is experiencing challenges due to global supply chain issues, resulting in the late delivery of engines and parts for our Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This means we currently have 787 aircraft on the ground and unable to fly. We’re not the only airline experiencing this issue and are doing all we can to work with Rolls-Royce to resolve the situation. 

We’re incredibly disappointed and sorry that we’re in this position, and that it has led to the cancellation of your flight. We know this will be extremely frustrating, but we wanted to give you as much notice as possible of this issue so that we’re able to get your plans back on track.

Estimation of if this is worth doing,"Hi everyone! So we just bought a Quad Level home (a little over 2100 sqft not including basement) for $400K and we are both in our mid 20s so planning for the future. Right now it’s a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom. Main level where front door opens is the parlor room, dining room, kitchen, and then Upstairs 3 bedrooms and 1 dual vanity full bathroom (shower and bath). One bedroom is slightly bigger which is the only thing that makes it a master, and the bathroom is for all. Below the main level is ground level, and the bedroom down there is connected to the garage and has a door to go to the backyard so it’s better suited to an office and then the informal living room/movie room is the living space of that floor. There is also a full bathroom with just a shower. I will say the entire home has been recently updated so we have no projects we need to do. Bathrooms and kitchen are all quartzite that look like Marble and regrettably everything is white and black. I plan to paint and wall paper to add color but the only stuff easy to change I know that’s all what sells. 

My question:

The fourth level under ground is an actual basement and is also where the laundry room is. There is the perfect amount of space to finish it and make an actual nice laundry room, a larger bedroom with onsuite full bathroom and walk in closet and then a very large storage room with the space left over. Piping is already in place for all of this but not sure what it would cost to finish it. While we’re living here the idea is that each future kid would have a room plus a guest room, and we would make our master in the basement. I know a lot of people would not prefer that, but I think the fact that there’s not really a master bed/bath/closet it may make sense.

Would this increase the value of our home or at least break even? If we WANTED it to increase the value of the home would adding the escape ladder cut out infront of the window so it can formally be counted as a 5 Bed 3 Bath house vs 4 Bed 2 Bath house? Or  bc it’s quad level &amp; there’s only 7 steps to the main level and an outdoor exit right there would even be necessary. I know this would work best for us and allow us to stay in our starter home maybe 15 or so years. It’s also in the most desirable part of the city so it should sell fast no matter what we do to it.


Another questions is really, do people value having an actual Master Suite that much? Or would it be easier to just add a small bedroom, decent closet and a half bath, and then the actual nice laundry room and leave the rest storage. I have no problem with having the master in the basement as long as there IS one but idk you guys would know better than me what actually sells.

I know that’s a lot, happy to make a separate post follow up with photos of how it is now. This is not our forever home so we will be looking at this like sellers. I do think I should point out that most of the homes in the area are 3/4 bed 2bath houses selling for $350k-$500 k. And then the larger homes tend to go for $600k-1.2MM",36,7,3048,597,0

Renting a car in the US as a Canadian and I have some questions.,"I am flying to Vegas next week where I have a whole 12 day trip planned out with my girlfriend. My hotels, flights, and car rental are already booked and paid through Booking.com. We will be picking our car up at the Las Vegas airport through the company Fox. I have never rented a car before, let alone in a different country so I’m a bit stressed about the logistics.

Here are my questions:

-  I will have my Canadian passport, Ontario drivers licence, printed voucher, and printed insurance invoice with me. This is everything the booking says is required but is there anything else I should bring?

- In the fine print of the voucher, it says that I may need proof of original licence issue date if my drivers licence has been renewed. My girlfriend says this isn’t a big deal and I don’t need to do this. Is it really a big deal if I don’t have this? It would be a headache and extra expense to go to the service ontario and figure this out. 

- assuming my flights go without delay, I will arrive at the airport at 10:30pm and my car rental from fox is scheduled to be picked up at 11:30pm. I am worried I didn’t give myself enough time to deal with finding my checked bags and dealing with customs or whatever. Can I just call the place in advance if I’m running late?

- We are scheduled to stay at the Luxor hotel for the first 3 nights but we will only most likely be checking in at like midnight - 1am the first night. Is this worth calling them in advance?

Strategy help to negotiate with seller? ,"I am under contract on a nice 3bd 2ba home built in 1999. My offer was pretty simple: full asking price with a 45 day closing and 10 day inspection period. 30yr conventional with 20% down. The sellers are elderly and have been trying to sell this home for a little over 1yr. Starting at $520k and dropping down to $475k. They went pending once in August and that buyer walked.
  
I have 5 business days left for the inspection period, and have found 2 items that I'd like to negotiate with the seller. 

1. The water pressure in the home starts strong and in a matter of seconds tapers off. The home is on city water, and I don't think it would be possible to do 2 water tasks at once. Ie take a shower and wash dishes, or run the sprinklers and wash machine at the same time. The issue occurs with hot and cold water. The inspector thinks it is likely a broken valve. I would like to ask the sellers to resolve this issue before closing.



2. The roof is original to the home. I got 2 bids for the roof, ranging from $15k-18k pending the materials used. The roofer expects the roof has about 3yrs left. The original roof is making my home insurance quotes much higher than originally expected. I would like to ask the seller to contribute $10k in either price reduction or closing cost credit.

How would you negotiate this? What are the potential strategies?

Seller provided wrong fencing data on MLS can i sue them for financial losses? WA state,"Seller provided wrong fencing info on MLS, can i sue them? Anyone did this before?

Hi All, my seller/selling agent on MLS data stated that home is fully fenced. Few months after buying house we came to know that one of the fence may be completely owned by neighbour. We have 3 neighbours, seems like other 2 side of fence is ok as its shared.

We painted the fence thinking its ours and neighbour complained its their fence and replaced the fence and asking us for money(around usd 2500). 
Also we this portion is now different color than our paint of rest of fence so at some point we have to put new fence for that portion and paint with same color again(2500 usd around again)

The seller or seller agent are not responding to us now whether they paid for that fence or its shared or not.
Can i sue them in small court for 5000 usd?

PS - turns out part of the fence, is on my side of property line, does it change anything?",87,16,928,172,0

What can be done with absolutely worthless land?,"Some years ago, I inherited some absolutely worthless land in Louisiana.

I found records showing that mineral rights were leased to an oil company in the 1970s. That lease has long since expired, and I’m guessing they found nothing.

Planning a trip to Ireland / Scotland.  First time to either country but from the YouTube research, I'll probably be back to see more of the scenery lol.

I was planning to rent a car.  

So my questions are this - which country would you do first?  What are some drives or loops that you would recommend to see the scenery in either country?  Is there any self-led audiotours that someone can do for either country? (Ie like guide along tours or action tour guide apps)

Also, how would you recommend traveling between the 2 countries - from my research, it looks like plane or ferry (if I did ferry, it looks like you can catch a bus between belfast-galway which goes from city center to city center via the ferry)

Can a seller's realtor blacklist a buyer? ,"For context, I'm in Quebec Canada. We have been looking for a house for 8 months with little luck.

Cairo really doesn't deserve the bad reputation.... ,"As the title says

Egypt is an r/travel  hall of famer when it comes too 'don't travel there its horrendous' (generally alongside India and Morocco) 

 I have been to one of these other places (Morocco) - Marrakesh and Fez, which I do  consider dreadful, as I can honestly not even count on 1 hand the amount of honest interractions I had in 6 days. Everything was some sort of scam, not too mention people constantly bothering you, following you, trying to approach and give you wrong directions among other things. 

From what I have read, Cairo is Morocco on steroids, so I was expecting the worst when I went there...

  
I have been to Cairo twice in the last months, and I really do not understand the bad reptuation at all! Granted the city is filthy dirty and the poverty is dreadful,  but the people are absolutely FINE. I have not had a single bad experiance in over 12 days in the city, (travelled all over the city, tourist areas and normal areas), and people were overwhelmingly friendly. This includes walking in extremely run down areas / markets, riding public buses and being the only obvious foreigner in sight for hours in some areas and walking after dark. People driving by would regularly shout out 'hello / welcome' with zero other intentions other than to be friendly. 

  
Note I am visiting (Arab)  family in Cairo, so have spent time with them, so PERHAPS that could be part of the reason for the discrepancy with other travellers. However I am 25M white, and my mum is 55 and white, and we spent plenty of time walking alone without them, including after midnight through public areas without a single issue.  So even time spent wiethout them there was zero issues. 

I have found Egyptians to be overwhelmingly kind and friendly, and nobody ran up the prices at anytime trying to scam us (we always checked with our inlaws who live there). The only negative experiances I had were at the pyramids - probably the worst ran tourist site ive ever been too. And also passport control leaving Cairo, 2 times running they messed up my wife's passport and tried to charge her for 'overstaying her visa'... Which turns out was pefectly valid on both occasions. 

The only place I had any mild hassling was the Khalili tourist street, outside main tourist areas - zero trouble

"First time home buyer, need help with water damages","Hey everyone how's it going. I'm 23 and currently looking at houses to buy. I have my pre approval letter for 200k, and that is my price range and budget as all expenses would be around 20% of my income. 

I've found a few houses, one in particular that caught my eye. 1300sqft with a single car garage, a nice front yard and fenced in backyard. It's a brick house. My area was hit by Hurricane Helene, so lots of rain happened over the past weekend. One thing I noticed on my tour today was what appears to be water damage coming from the roof, down to the kitchen ceiling and walls. I saw slight paint peeling, slight yellowing on the popcorn ceilings as well as a crumpled up tarp on the roof where I can assume the water was getting in.  The kitchen windows were also open I'm assuming to air it out.The roof also looked like it was overdue for a replacement. 

Should I even mess with this house? It's listed at 209k, but I'm trying to figure out how I can talk them down due to the damages, or see if they can file an insurance claim to have the roof and water damages taken care of.

Advice on using VA loan effectively. Not urgently buying. Just looking at options. ,"Using the VA loan to get into real estate. What is the best option?

I know va loan only works individually unless married. What would be the best way to go about us working together to get financially independent in this way? Also we are both single, never married, no kids. I'm 30 and he's 24 years old.

Orange County Home Buyer - Buyer’s Agent or No?,"Td;dr:
1. Buyer’s agent necessary?
2. Correct to think about offer as 103% of our offer if we don’t use one?
3. OC attorney / title rec?
4. If we use a buyer’s agent, what % on a $1.7-2.0M home?

We know who we would use if we were to use a buyer’s agent - a realtor that helped us negotiate the lease for our current rental home for no charge.

Question is, do we really need a buyer’s agent or should we put an offer in without one clearly stipulating the buyer’s agent portion should be credited back to the seller? So a $2,000,000 offer, which would be $1,880,000 net to the seller assuming 3%/3% seller/buyer agent, would actually be $1,940,000. Can someone please tell me if I’m thinking about this correctly?

Finally, any recommendations around whether we should use a buyer’s agent? I am in real estate private equity and my job is to negotiate things, and I’m a previously-licensed real estate agent from another state (though admittedly I worked almost entirely on rentals, owned a brokerage shop in college). Can I get away with just having a good real estate attorney / title company? If so, bonus points for any recommendations in Orange County.

12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

Apartment Complex Basement,"
I am currently in the beginning stages of a planned 24-unit apartment complex. I have developed 1-4 family homes, but have an opportunity to do something larger thanks to a recent rezoning of a property I own. 

I’ve figured I can put a roughly 80x80 building on the site. There is an existing building there and this would sit essentially in the same spot but the new building will be slightly larger. The current building has a basement that I’ll need to rip out to put I. The larger one. But that has me thinking….should I even put one?

There’s obviously advantages to having the extra space. I could find ways to add additional revenue through storage locker rentals or other ideas. Plus, if you’re going to do it now is really the only time to do it. You can’t really go back in after the fact and add one if you decide you need it later. 

But there are also drop backs. Basements have a tendency to have moisture and humidity issues. It bumps up the cost a good amount over a slab. The front door would require steps to get into the building, etc. 

So what are your thoughts? Basement or no basement?",26,3,1110,204,0

However when I went down to our county office, they made it seem like it was illegal for me to acquire a property that way, through taxes. They said They put foreclosure up for auction and thats like the only way I can try to acquire an abandoned property… I have heard of plenty of people doing delinquent taxes here recently. 

To me it seemed like they were just trying to wait it out to acquire the land themselves. 

Any information? I live in NC if that helps.

I appreciate all of the help and information, especially resources and examples. I was definitely misinformed! We are going to look for auctions in our county and try to reach the deceaseds family directly. ",15,2,1130,206,0

Selling a house that is not mine but the legal way ,"Hello everyone.

I live in France and my question is extremely simple.

If I see a house that goes for 550K€ from a particular (no agency)

Can I create a post on a real estate forum where I’m selling the house for 700K€?

Once someone called me to visit the house, I’m calling the real owner and explain the situation : I give him the 600K (50Kmore than original price) and I keep the 100K€ left.

Removing spouse’s name on passport mandatory?,"Indian citizen. Travelling to croatia in early 2025. My passport (renewed in 2019) mentions my spouse’s name. I have since (2023) gotten divorced.

I assume the schengen visa application form does ask for marital status, would the conflict between my passport and my form likely to get my application rejected?

7 Week South America Itinerary - June and July 2025 - Feedback Welcome!,"I will be travelling with my girlfriend to South America for 7 weeks starting in mid-June 2025 as part of a gap year. We're both 21, and are looking for an itinerary that is realistic based on transport links within the region, and not too strenuous while still being quite ambitious. We'd like the trip to include a real mix of experiences, including nature, culture, activities and also some relaxation. We'll be on a moderate budget, staying in budget double accommodation where possible and not splashing out - but with room to spend on activities/trips that really interest us.

The proposed itinerary (which admittedly has changed a lot during planning) is as follows:

Arrive in Lima from San Jose

**3 nights in Lima (possibly 1 in Huacachina)**

-&gt; Flight to Puerto Maldonado

**2 nights in Puerto Maldonado**

**3 nights in an Amazon lodge**

-&gt; Flight to Cusco

**6 nights in Cusco**

-&gt; Night bus to Puno

**2 nights in Puno**

-&gt; Bus to La Paz

**5 nights in La Paz**

-&gt; Flight to Uyuni

**2 nights in Uyuni**

-&gt; Bus to San Pedro de Atacama

**5 nights in San Pedro de Atacama**

-&gt; Bus to Salta

**5 nights in Salta**

-&gt; Flight to Buenos Aires

**6 nights in Buenos Aires**

-&gt; Flight to Iguazu

**2 nights Iguazu Falls**

-&gt; Flight to Rio

**6 nights Rio de Janeiro**

-&gt; Fly home to UK

Within the places where we'll be staying longer will of course be room to go on a few day trips to areas of interest.

I know that it is ambitious, but we've experienced travelling on a more intense schedule than this before (although that was in Europe) and I think that 5-6 nights in a lot of these places will be more than enough. It is always our intention to go back to the places that we like best, and we will be looking to do a more substantial visit to Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the future (not necessarily at the same time!) - this is *not intended to be our one and only experience of each of these places*. On the other hand, if we were never able to go back for whatever reason, then we will know that we saw as much as possible without rushing it *too* much.

Based on this I'd be very grateful to receive any feedback at all - good or bad - particularly if anyone has had experience with visiting any of these places/travelling any of these routes. Any any general tips would also be gratefully received.

Thank you! :)",71,13,2378,397,1

"Looking for advice, TAP or KLM for a trip to Brazil?","Hi everyone, I want to travel to Brazil (FLN, return from BSB or GYN) from the Netherlands (AMS) in March. The only viable options seem to be TAP (via Lisbon) or KLM (via São Paulo or Rio).

Something that's important to me is possibly being able to get assistance. I'm autistic, I can take care of myself so it's not a necessity but it'd help a lot. I know the sunflower lanyard is known with KLM but TAP doesn't seem to be trained with it. I'm not sure if it's known with the domestic airlines in Brazil.

I also have some questions about the São Paulo/Rio airports. What's it like having to switch from international to domestic flights? Do I have to check in all over again, is it far away? Is it easy to find English speaking personnel? This is one of my boyfriends' worries since I don't speak PT very well.

I saw I'd possibly have to do a ""self-transfer"" in Lisbon, what is this like? Also, does anyone know if TAPs prices ever lower again? The price recently got raised and hasn't gone down again.

To me the TAP flights seem easier, times are perfect (good layovers too!), but I'm not sure how reliable they are. I read a lot about baggage rules, but I don't mind putting in extra effort to make sure I'm not going over the limits. To be honest, I'd do that no matter the airline.

"I've searched a lot, to arrive Spain (Tarifa or Algeciras) from Morocco (Tangier), still got some questions.","Hi travelers and dear local fellows,

I am planning a trip to Morocco and in my plan, I'll take the ferry from Tangier to Tarifa, then local transportation to Malaga. Simple answer to this route, rather than just fly away, is that I wan to try something fun, and the Strait of Gilbralter is on my checklist as well. The date of this route is expected to be on Oct 31 or Nov 01.

However, I'd like to consult your experiences if I should do Tangier-Tarifa or TangierMed-Algeciras.

I will be staying in the town of Tangier, for the eve.

Besides, I am a bit uncertain about the local transportation between Tarifa and Algeciras. Rome2Rio tells me that there are regular bus routs operated by local transportation company. My concern is that what about the fare and how should I pay the ticket? Does it take credit card? or I should buy the ticket somewhere?

After arriving Malaga, I will be staying Malaga for 2 nights and then fly back. Should I book my day tour to Granada and Alhambra?

Is the real estate market today harder to break into than it was 10 years ago?,"I’ve been saving for a while and managed to pull together a decent budget recently. I’m thinking about getting into real estate, but everything I’ve been hearing lately is making me second-guess the timing. Everyone seems to say the market is way more difficult now than it was 10 years ago—higher prices, tougher competition, and more regulations to deal with.

Back then, it seemed like real estate was a solid investment with relatively predictable returns. Now, people are warning me about razor-thin margins and how hard it is to even break even, let alone turn a profit. I was hoping to get into property flipping or maybe rental investments with a $30,000 win I had on Stake, but now I’m not so sure.

For those of you who’ve been in real estate for a while, how do things compare today to a decade ago? Is it really as tough as everyone says, or are there still good opportunities if you know where to look? I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether now’s the right time to jump in, or if it’s better to wait for the market to cool off a bit.

Huge down payment - how to execute ,"Long story short my wife’s parents are giving us $200k for a house. I’ve done a budget and determined that with our monthly income, monthly expenses, emergency fund, etc, we can afford a $525k house AFTER we use the $200k to knock the loan down.

Shared Gas Meter between two houses in NYC,"So my family and I are looking into buying two houses right next to each other in NYC that are quite interesting.

Assuming a VA Loan,"Hey there,

Curious if anyone has any tips here. We’ve fallen in love with a house of our friend’s and they haven’t listed it yet but just announced they are prepping to sell.

Please help! Not sure what to do!,"Sorry in advance for the long post! 

The back story:

In the end of 2022 my husband and I were house hunting with a realtor. We got under contract and our lender pulled out and ended up being a shiesty individual who was not doing things legally. Because my husband was self employed we struggled to get approval from another lender. We ended up accepting that it wasn't the right time to by and held off. My sister became a real estate agent in the beginning of 2024. After becoming an agent she connected with the agent we worked with before and was signed up to have her as a mentor and signed on with their brokerage. Over the following months my sister expressed second thoughts about real estate and not exactly liking the mentorship, but didn't express much about it to me other than that. She had begun applying for jobs outside of real estate and I wasn't really sure if she was even still working with the brokerage or communicating with them. 

The situation:

We were looking for some guidance on if we might be eligible to buy now and were told the best thing to do was apply for pre approval and that if you weren't approved they could tell us what to work on to get approval. We applied with an online lender that we had applied with during 2022. It is a well known online lender. This lender still had part of our application info on file including our agent info and we simply updated our info. What I didn't know what that they would automatically forward any denial or pre approval to the agent listed. Last time we applied the guy sent us the approval letter via email to forward to our agent. As a surprise to us we were pre approved and that online lender sent the pre approval to the agent immediately. She reached out right away and was like ""Oh are we ready to buy??"" I was put on the spot because I didn't know she would be told like that so quickly. I felt bad because she had shown us multiple properties and even got us under contract last time so I went with it and said yes. Since she was my sisters mentor we talked about her having my sister help with showings and other things on the deal and that my sister would be compensated. I wasn't sure how the mentorship worked and if they had some type of agreement to split commissions on things like this. I assumed this would mean my sister would be paid in some way if we purchased. The agent did ask me if ""my sister was still in real estate because she hadn't heard from her in a while"" and I thought my sister must not be working with her anymore - she tends to ghost people instead of addressing things head on.  I told my sister right away and assumed she would reach out to the agent and discuss how the financials of that would work especially since I told her the agent said she hadn't heard back from her. My sister did not reach out. The agent did not reach out to my sister. The agent started showing us properties and my sister didn't really say much to me or act excited to be involved. Along the way of seeing properties and working with the realtor, she seemed different this time. Less friendly, less willing to pull comps or try and negotiate deals on overpriced homes that had been sitting for a while. It felt like we were bothering her every time we were asking to see a home. It seems as if she just wants us to settle and buy something right away. This is our first home purchase and I want to make sure I've done all my research and make a smart financial decision. We are spending $400-500k so it's a big purchase. The agent will ask me if I want to put in an offer on a home we saw and if so how much and I'm having to ask her to do things like pull comps so I can make an informed decision. My husband and I haven't been happy with the service or the vibes the realtor is giving off this time around. My sister reached out to us last night and said she felt it was a betrayal and stab in the back that we didn't sign her as our agent and said that since our current agent was her mentor that she would've been involved and received some of the commissions and that it would've greatly helped my sister get established and make some kind of income. She said that we should've come to her before the realtor and that of course as my sister she should've been our agent. I tried explaining that the pre approval sent so quickly and that we were put under the spot and felt guilty with the previous agent and tried to ensure my sister would be compensated and involved in some way. My sister didn't want to hear it and didn't care and continued to go off about how f\*cked up it was and that it shouldn't have been handled that way. We aren't happy with our current realtor, but we signed an exclusivity contract. We are in a weird spot. If my sister would've come to me in a calm way and explained she was hurt early in this process we could've avoided signing this contract and made her our agent. The fact that she didn't reach out to her mentor right away and say ""hey my sister said she was approved and wants me involved in her home search, how are we handling commission"" didn't help. The agent also didn't reach out to my sister and say ""hey your sister is pre approved and signing on with us do you want to take on most of the work and split a percentage of this commission"". I'm at a loss as to what is the right thing to do here. We aren't in a rush to buy, but want to get under contract before the end of the year and close before March of next year. 

Please share your advice or what you would do in this scenario. AGAIN sorry for this long rant, I just felt the details were important. ",33,7,5606,1077,0

Looking for Culturally Interesting (or shocking) Places in India ,"Hi everyone,

I’m planning my next trip to India and would love some recommendations for places with rich culture and history. I’ve already been to:

* Delhi
* Agra
* Jaipur
* Udaipur
* Kolkata
* Andaman Islands
* Bodh Gaya
* Varanasi
* Khajuraho
* Chennai
* Mahabalipuram

Out of all these, I found Varanasi and Bodh Gaya the most interesting because of their strong spiritual and cultural vibes.

I’m looking for other culturally rich places to explore, and it doesn’t have to be a super popular tourist spot. I’m particularly drawn to places that give you chills or a sense of cultural shock—those unique, deeply immersive experiences.

Any suggestions? Most likely I'll be exploring north-west part with the next trip, but your answers doesn't have to be limited to that area.  
  
Thanks so much!",65,10,801,124,1

Survey shows more land than entered into contract for,"I’m in contract to buy a house in Arkansas, and we paid for a survey. The survey came back showing .28 more acreage than was listed and when we asked about it we were told that the seller had “gifted” or maybe sold that portion of land (to the neighbor) but when I look at the county assessors website it doesn’t show the reduction from 1.85 to the 1.57 we thought we were buying. I asked my realtor to get with the sellers agent and get some kind of explanation in writing cause it sounds kind of sketchy to me, but my realtor said I’m not likely to get it. 

It sounds like something isn’t or wasn’t done right and I don’t want to find myself in a legal situation. What documentation would show the portion of property as legally transferred? Can the seller just ask a new surveyor to re-draw the lines without that portion?

Recourse for bank holding onto property for more than two years?,"There is a property that we’ve looked at when it’s been listed for 7 years now. We bid on it back when it went on auction in 2017, but they wanted too much. It’s been left to rot, and it looks like whenever it’s been more than two years, they sell it for some amount to another mortgage company and then weeks later buy it back for 0 dollars. One of the banks involved is Citi who apparently was fined 30M for this in 2019. We want to make a fair offer for it, but it is quite dilapidated after years of neglect, and they want even more than what the reserve was back then. We offered something low thinking they would work with us to find a middle number, and they went down less than 5k. Has anyone had success prying a property like this away from the bank for an amount that makes sense? It’s got such great potential, and it’s a shame for it to just rot.",64,11,859,170,0

Utilities off in a fixer upper we looked at,"We are looking to buy a fixer upper in the town near us to fix up and maybe rent out.  It needs some clean up work but the bones and foundation are good.  It had a newer (last 10 years) electric panel and furnace.

The main thing I am nervous about is all the utilities are off so I don't know if the electric, water, plumbing, and natural gas work.  

We told our realtor and we would like to put a cash offer on the house, but would like to make sure all the utilities still work.  Our realtor got back to us and said the previous owner seemed very poor but would looking into how much it would cost to turn the utilities back on to test them.

We really like the house and it is pretty cheap. So I was just wondering if this is something to be concerned about, is there a process for checking the utilities in a situation like this?  Is this something we can sign a contract on but with the stipulation that these things are verified before closing?

Removing HVAC - Foreclosure - Homeowner Deceased,"I have a relative who took out a loan though his bank for a HVAC unit for his daughter's home.  She was making the payments, but unexpectedly passed away earlier this week.  Unbeknownst to her father, she has been in default for several years and the lender began foreclosure proceedings on her house in May 2024 and it has not been finalized.

In South Carolina, HVAC units are ""fixtures"" to the property and stay with the property when it is sold. But the property hasn't been taken back by the lender yet.

Can my relative remove the HVAC system from her house?  The deceased purchased it in full (with the loan) so isn't the unit technically hers?

Either way, the father is going to begin payments since it is technically his loan.

What's the allure of the golden triangle of India besides Taj Mahal?,"As an indian, who has done it all I found it very anti-climactic and exhausting. The golden triangle represents the worst of Indian tourist traps. I understand the perspective of poverty porn for some people who wish to feel better about themselves and visit the old part of delhi which is imo a horrible place for travel unfit for international tourists. However, it seems incredibly masochistic to subject yourself to the torture. Furthermore, people get discouraged by their bad experiences and get so demotivated that they leave halfway without seeing the more beautiful parts of India. Delhi belly is not even something that only happens to international tourists. I got the runs within 4 days of arriving in Delhi. I am genuinely curious because there are established tourism infrastructures around the other parts of India as well. IT'S not like the golden triangle is the only well connected route for travel. if you go to the South you have the Nilgiri hills, Malabar coast and the religious temple route. If you go to the Northeast you have tea gardens and various nature spots. if you go further North you have the Srinagar, Kashmir; Leh, ladakh and the Dehradun, Uttarakhand route. Similar routes for East and West. These routes literally take less than a week to travel through and are quite easy with a good agency to take on. 

If it is air travel then Mumbai or Bangalore have almost equivalent if not the same level of connectivity as Delhi. with two new international airports opening near Delhi and Mumbai respectively it's going to be a cut to cut connectivity comparison anyways.  ",68,12,1602,273,1

What could my MIL be scheming? ,"Sorry if this doesn't belong in this sub, but it is real estate related. I want to make it clear that I'm not asking for relationship advice.

Background context: Unfortunately, I have a MIL who hates me and is so upset that my husband and I bought a house together ""without consulting her first"", that she vowed to never step foot into our house. She's furious that I'm on the title. To this day, she hasn’t visited, skipped out on our Thanksgiving dinner, and has made no effort to see her 15-month-old granddaughter unless we drive more than an hour to her house. For some context, she's extremely overbearing, controlling and will throw a tantrum to get her way. Also, money is a huge deal to her, and she’s always had this belief that women are out to take financial advantage of their husbands (which honestly feels like projection to me). She thinks I'm riding on the coattails of my husband's success (he's a surgeon) despite the fact that my husband and I both work FT and have solid incomes, each making well into the six figures. She hates that I'm living a comfortable life and wishes I could suffer more (yes, she actually said that).

Out of nowhere, my MIL made a proposal to my husband. She told him she has some extra cash lying around (about 400k), and would like to either 1) invest in our house, and if we sell one day, she would take a percentage of the profits, or 2) she could loan us the $400k at a 3% interest rate to help us pay off our mortgage faster and save money. She claims it’s a low-risk way to park her money, and that it would benefit us too. I don't think she expects us to add her name to the title, but who knows. Her reasoning doesn’t sit right with me, especially since there are many other avenues that could easily give her a better return with less risk, like a CD. It feels odd that she was so opposed to us buying this house, but now wants to be financially involved.

I’m firmly against the idea due to how she’s treated me in the past, and I don’t trust her motives. She is crazy and has started lawsuits for really trivial matters. My husband, on the other hand, is disappointed because he sees it as a way to save a significant amount of money. We bought the house just over a year ago with a 6% interest rate, and living in a VHCOL, our mortgage is around $7k/month. Sure, we could save some money, but I don’t think it’s worth the potential strain it could cause in our relationship.

I have already said no to her proposal but out of curiosity, I want to know what others think her true intentions might be. **I'm wondering if there is some obscure real estate law that would allow her to have leverage if she loaned us money?** I can't help but to think she is scheming for a way to take more control or maybe she's found a way to screw me over. I just don't believe her motives are out of the kindness of her heart.

Update:

Thanks everyone for your comments. I feel validated that I'm not overreacting due to my biases against her. Accepting the offer was never on the table for me. My husband actually told her no as soon as she brought it up. I do agree it's her way of asserting control or gaining some kind of leverage. She often thinks 10 steps ahead so I wouldn't be surprised if she's trying to position herself ahead in case we divorce or something. ",31,7,3315,618,0

Advice needed on my condo,"I created this account to remain anonymous. I own a condo in a busy and touristy part of a Midwest city. I’m moving out of state for a job. I listed my condo (A) for sale about a month ago. I priced it below the price of another active listing (B). At the time there was one (C) already in escrow. Here is the price hierarchy: C &gt; B &gt; A (mine). All 3 belong to the same HOA. A couple months before that, another unit sold at B’s price.

In term of condition, C is upstairs and recently remodeled the kitchen and repainted. I’d like to think my condition is pretty good but just a little outdated compared to C (~ 80% vs C). Mine and B’s conditions are about the same and both are downstairs.

I’ve had 2 showings, of which one made an offer below asking. I ultimately rejected it because I thought my listed price was more than fair (cheapest). The lack of showing is worrying and I think buyers are now just waiting for rates to drop further. Location is certainly not an issue. To be clear, I’m paying my seller agent 2.5% and willing to pay buyer agent 2.5%.

Following my realtor’s advice, I just reduced the price by 2% but don’t think this would do anything. I prefer selling. But I’d rather rent it out than selling it out of desperation. I understand that finding a good property manager and be an out-of-state owner is not easy.

What do you all think? By the way we have not had an open house. Not sure if any serious buyers would come in either.

Sellers refusing to vacate house after closing ,"Update: we told them we aren’t closing unless they are out of the house. Their realtor is still saying they will not agree to close unless we agree to let them stay. I highly doubt they will breach the contract and risk losing out of their other house so I will keep you all updated on what happens next. Either way, we are not closing until they are out of the house. Thank you all for your advice. I have read every comment and appreciate your input so much. It’s helped me tremendously. 

++ 

I’m closing in two days and the seller’s realtor suddenly told our realtor that the sellers needs to stay in the house for a few more days until they close on their home. We asked to push the closing back and they are refusing to do that. They said they will not leave no matter what. They said they will not pay us rent for the time spent there either. They are willing to give money in the form of a security deposit though. 

My thought was just to close on the house and tell them they need to be out, and if they’re not then call the cops on them if they don’t leave. My partner doesn’t want to do this because of the bad impression it will make on new neighbors, the drama of it, etc. 

Our realtor is suggesting we just ask for more money in security deposit and say we keep the money if they are not out by a certain date. The sellers also do not want us there while they are living there, so just to be assholes we would plan on going over anyways and making them feel as awkward as humanely possible to encourage them to leave ",47,8,1534,300,0

Debating paying a large sum on my new rental property?,"We recently closed on an investment property and paid the first mortgage. We put 25% down but I was still stunned to see the breakdown. I knew interest is the biggest part but this just feels so out of place for me. 

$290.08 went to principal and $2,417.23 to interest 

380k loan at 7.62%. I already have it set to pay additional $800/month to bring it down to a 15 year pay off. We intend to refinance in 6 months when we are eligible to do so. But I still can’t stomach this much interest. 

I have 100k in a money market account. Do I take a chunk of that to throw at this mortgage to decrease the interest immediately? Is there any formula to see how much of a chunk would make the biggest impact? I’m thinking there has to be a threshold where after a certain amount it plateaus. My thought is meet in the middle and throw 50k at it and leave 50k in the market.

GMAC Mortgage With Maturity Date of 2013 Not Discharged,"Purchased home in 2018, but had buy title insurance since previous owner had a mortgage with GMAC mortgage, that went out of business around 2009 and was never discharged.

Need some opinions on my USA itinerary for next year ,"
Hi!
I am planning a trip to the US with my best friend for next year in May. We’re going for 3 weeks. We’re from Australia 

Could I have some opinions on how our itinerary looks so far? 
Our main priority is New York which we don’t want any less time in. 
We don’t really want to skip any places but just want to know if the amount of time we’re spending in each place sounds like enough or if it’s too much. 
We land and leave from LA - hence why we’re back there at the end. 
We won’t be using a car and will be flying to each place. 

Los Angeles 4 nights
New Orleans 3 nights
New York City 9 nights 
San Fransisco 3 nights
Los Angeles 2 nights

Thank you!!!",53,11,663,129,1
Morocco is a two edged sword,"Well after spending two weeks in Morocco together with my Girlfriend I can write some things that might interest people who are looking for a trip to Morocco.

We are both students in our 20s, we‘re from Europe, so therefore I think I am gonna speak for a majority of people here.

In total we have visited 5-6 destinations, made the standard trip from Essaouira to Marrakech, afterwards a desert tour to Ouarzazate/Merzouga, Fes, Chefchaouen and Casablanca.

Essaouira: We spent 3 nights there. It is a nice little, quiet and relaxed town on the atlantic coast. When it comes to sightseeing, it doed not deliver that much. You can take a visit to the city walls or the jewish museum. You might wanna take a look into the local art galleries but all in all - the streets of the medina are the actual sights. You feel like you have been put around 200 years back (not in a bad sense) because the old city structures are well withheld. Expect being scammed at the local bazaar but thats the first thing you learn about this country: EVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE you don‘t know the official prices you ask first. Dont be afraid to negotiate, this rule applies to every city in Morocco. Always come with some laughable 30% of the original price being told to you. It will work wonders.

Marrakech: This city, if it would not be for a few nice locals, would‘ve dissapointed me completely. Overpriced food (if you dont want to eat the same 6 dishes around the country (tajine, couscous, pastilla, harira, msemen or chakchouka) for your whole trip) which is made mostly bland - not a lot of love put into it and always accompanied by hidden fees of some sorts, men on the streets who want to make you feel lost if you cant find your destination (every time you get approached just politely decline) and overrun sights. There are motorcycles everywhere, the air quality is really! bad and being lost in the souks after 9 pm will give you an headache.

After that we did our desert trip which was the highlight- 3 days of traveling through the atlas and the Sahara desert (planned by Marrakech city life where there are some badly/costly plans are being made aswell but you really get every penny you put in there back again with mesmerizing views etc) 

Fes: I loved this city. Even though the Medina is an even bigger maze than Marrakechs is - the city is cleaner - way more historic - a lot of sights to see with total costs under 10 Euros for every possible sight in total.
Dont be afraid of people on the internet telling you that you should avoid the medina after the sun sets. We have been in the streets every day until midnight and felt (most of the time) very safe. As long as you stick to the more lightet streets, you will do good. Fes really is worth visiting as it is cheaper than marrakech and the food options are better

Chefchaouen: What a sweet little town! It reminds me of my hometown, its right beside some mountains, most of the homes are charmingly colored in different shades of blue, the people are not pushy at all and you can really relax here. You should definitely taste the local food here as it is more hygienic and way better prepared than in other cities.

All in all: some last points to consider in Morocco

1.) Not everyone are as nice as they act. If people are pushy, just avoid them. They will start conversations with „where are you from“ etc. This should (mostly) be avoided.

2.) Talk to ordinary people. They have so much to tell and talk about. I feel like people desperately depending on tourists are the nicest I met anywhere in the world.

3.) Watch out for the hygienic standards as some of the food may poison you

4.) In marrakech and Fes: Google maps in the Medina is mostly not helpful. It will try to lead you through sketchy streets where some even more sketchy people are waiting for tourists.

5.) Politely declining works 95% of the time. You dont have to fear that anything can happen to you (physically) I can guarantee that

6.) Try relying less on google and more on your ears/eyes and nose. Some recommendations are just by people who cant step out of their comfort zone

7.) Try negotiating with everything which has no price tag. And if the price tag seems dodgy, ask nicely if there is any room for price negotiation.

8.) When negotiating, dont feel bad to throw out some laughable offers. For example: if a scarf costs 200DAM (20€) tell the seller that you are offering 70, or even less DAM. It is a good starting point to meet somewhere sround your actual desired price.

9.) If someone is calling you, telling you that your destination is „that way“ or „that the street is closed“ ignore it. This will happen in Marrakech and Casablanca.

10.) Enjoy the beautiful atlantic ocean, the mesmerizing high and low atlas, the sandy dunes of merzouga,the monkeys of the ourika valley, enjoy your tajine, zaalouk, chakchouka or your Mint tea. You are in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.",28,6,4960,877,1
Anyone out there noticing a decrease in home prices the last 2 weeks? ,"I live in the Midwest and have noticed a significant decrease across the board in home prices. I’m a buyer looking for a home for my family. However I can’t shake the feeling that this is the start of a larger trend for the following reasons, feel free to offer input on what you think! 

1. Yield curve just uninverted. Typically a recession follows in some capacity. Especially when a rate cut follows (as it did). 

2. Sahm rule (unemployment recession indicator) just flashed red.

3. Car repossessions are on a significant rise. Foreclosures are too but not as significantly.

4. I’m in the top 80% median household income for my area (nothing special ~169,000 pre-tax) and have consistently been priced out of what I consider to be relatively terrible houses with major issues. I’m not afraid of fixing something up and it’s what I’ve been looking for.

5. 4/5 of every house I look at in the $230,000-$450,000 is dropping 15-30k per week it seems. 

TLDR: Recession imminent? Prices are falling in my area.

Question about special assessment ,"We’re under contract to sell our home at the end of October. We disclosed a special assessment, as we received a letter from our village in 2023 letting us know we would need to replace our lead water line to the house. Our street has been ripped up getting new water and sewer lines for a year now. We never signed a contract or received a finalized amount on the cost to replace the lead line to our home- but were told in a letter it would be anywhere from $2,500-$5000, which would be added onto the water bill over a period of 12 months. 
Initially we told the buyers we would put $5,000 in escrow for them to use whenever they received notice that the line would be replaced (probably spring 2025, but again, there’s no contract with the village and a contractor right now - it’s being bid out). 
Our realtor informed us today that the buyers financing wouldn’t accept the $5,000 in escrow… and they want us to get a private quote from a contractor to have it replaced.
Does that make sense? This would all be fine but on top of this we’ve owned a new home now for over a month while waiting to sell ours, I’m 6 months pregnant dealing with contractors  and issues galore on the new house and I really don’t want to add another thing to my plate like finding someone to bid this out. 
Any other options?

"I want to visit Turks and Caicos, but I don't have a driver's license","Hi everyone!

After five intense years of working Mondays to Sundays building my (successful!) business and taking 0 vacation, I’m craving some well-deserved rest on a beautiful beach, soaking in the sun and gazing at the turquoise ocean.

I’m considering a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands and looking to book either an Airbnb or, more likely, a hotel there. While I will mostly rest, I want to explore the island, visit snorkeling spots, restaurants, bars, and different beaches. My concern is: I don't drive. I don't have a license. I read everywhere than renting a car is essential to move around.

So I'm wondering: Can I simply rely on the cabs? I understand it can be an expensive option, but I’m willing to spend some money. Do cabs go everywhere? Is there a hotel that’s closer to the main attractions?

Thank you so much for your help.

Advice on negotiating with a seller,"There’s a very special historic house that we really want. It’s been on the market for 1.5 years with a brief hiatus of a couple months. They have consistently lowered the price by 10-15% every 3 months to where they have had it on the market now for 3 months at 22% below the original price.

We made an offer last week for 20% below their current listed price and they responded by countering with a 4% price reduction. We countered, saying it was our best and final offer, by going up to 12% below their listed price and they dropped another small 3% amount and saying it was not their final offer. We waited a few days without responding and they reached back out asking for what we thought. We told them that we love the house but can’t go that high and are now looking at other houses. They responded by asking us to counter with anything, even “$500” more (which is .03% of the price - basically nothing) because they “don’t want to counter their own offer”. Any advice on what to do here? We really want the house but can only realistically pay another 5% more than our last offer max. We also worry they are trying to control us to limit what we might ask for on repairs.",35,6,1180,222,0
Need help explaining how bad of a deal this is to a family member.,"Ive got a family member that currently rents out a house on a farm thats worth 250k at about $800. The tenant wants to buy the house, but doesnt have enough for a down payment and says they cant secure a loan at a decent rate. The tenant is asking my family member to seller finance the house over 30 years at 3% with a 7k down payment , resulting in a monthly payment of ~$1024. The request would also allow for my family member to take the house into foreclosure if the tenant misses a monthly payment. While the family member sees this deal as a way to generously help out someone(the tenant) that is getting their life started, this deal also seems like a very bad deal financially. 

The family member understands that they will have to keep track of payments and that there would be work to do if the buyer defaults and the home goes into foreclosure, but im otherwise having a difficult time explaining how bad the deal seems to be financially and the other things(even good altruistic things) that could be done with the time and money if a different deal was made.

Buyer broker nightmare ,"Please advise. Husband and I saw a listing for a property and wanted to jump on it. We have a friend who is a realtor, but who was unavailable when the listing popped up. We contacted the listing agent (directly, not through Zillow) and left a message (no answer). A woman named ""R"" from the same brokerage called us back right away and told us that listing agent ""V"" was out of town but that she could help us. She explained that the property was section 8 tenant occupied and difficult to get into because ""the tenants were being difficult,"" but that she could get us in to view it the following day at 6pm. Not wanting to miss the opportunity, we agreed. She mentioned that we would need to sign some papers but that she would explain everything there. 

We got there and were in the middle of unloading our 3 small children from the car when ""R"" handed me a clipboard and said something like ""this is a formality because of the new laws- but once you sign this we're in compliance, and then I can show you the house."" Given that we were there and wanted to see the house, stupid me just signed it. Turns out that was a buyer broker agreement. She never reviewed what was in it or gave us a copy of it. That night I googled ""what do you sign before viewing a house"" and realized what we had done. 

We decided just hope for the best and move forward with this woman because we didn't want to miss out on the property. 

Turns out she owns the brokerage, so she's not just the agent, and the seller/listing agent is also from her brokerage. We happen to know the seller personally, and he was on sight when we viewed the house (he had to open a large shop on the property so we could view it) and was pleased to see that we wanted it. 
Long story short, after a week and half of confusing back and forth, we got such a bad deal in the end that we walked away from the sale. The seller contacted us privately and was furious; explained that he was not at all happy with the way he was represented and we explained that we weren't either. 

Now we want to know how to get out of this agreement. If I submit a written request to cancel the agreement and ""R"" refuses, what are our options? We cannot wait out the length of the contract- it's 90 days with a 30 day extension and seller wants to close before the end of the year for financial purposes. Please help!",23,4,2361,453,0

Is an appraisal letter of current home value good enough for Proof of Funds?,"My grandmother is selling her house and has an appraisal letter from just a couple months ago. She plans to sell her house before buying and pay fully in cash for a new home.

Would you consider an official home value appraisal enough grounds for scheduling house tours that usually require PoF, knowing that the plan is for the buyer to have the money by the time the purchase would occur?

EDIT: I realize I probably could have added a bit more context.

She has a lot of funds not currently tied up in the house, but the issue is that it’s split across various accounts and things because she’s still working on consolidating her finances after her late husband passed. It’s been a slow-going process and I was just curious if there’s a way we can see some houses before waiting for everything to settle. We are hoping to buy by end of year, and in the area we’re looking to move to houses tend to be on the market for a few months so a house we go and see now will probably still be for sale when we’re ready to make an offer. We’re looking in the $1-1.5M price range and her current house is in an extremely desirable location and will sell for about double that pretty much immediately. She has enough cash to put at least 50% down and pay the rest as soon as her house sells, or we’ll sell her house first and pay 100% in cash, depending on timing.",76,14,1355,254,0

Compare Flighty Vs Tripsy,"Hello everyone,

  
I'm an avid traveler. I usually like to keep my flights tracked through apps. I'm not too concerned with tracking hotel stays or car rental stuff, but it's good when I need it. I usually stay at Hilton hotels and use Avis for car rentals. Unless something unusual makes me deviate from either brand, I'm sticking to them. Flights on the other hand, are usually across many airlines. I like to keep a history of my flights too, just to see where I've been, so I do like the passport feature from Flighty.

I recently discovered Tripsy, I like the UI and I like the general itinerary record. I see that there is a flight/visited record feature, so that's a nice feature. This app reminds me of TripIt. I've used TripIt before, I didn't like the UI though. I didn't like the feel of the TripIt app, but I did love their website, which I ended up using far more than the app. One really great feature, although it's a pro feature, is the expense record keeping of Tripsy. It's really nice to see that immediately and not have to do that on the budgeting app.

I could go on and on about both apps. Again, I've used TripIt, I'm favoring Tripsy out of those two. But what are your thoughts of flight/itenarary keeping of both Flighty and Tripsy? Specifically, I'm thinking of getting a pro membership, so which one feels like you're getting your monies worth?

Bizarre inspection scenario ,"We put an offer on an older house that we plan to rehab.  We are financing the home so it must meet the  requirements for livability including, water, heat, electrical, etc.  It was clear in our offer that we will be financing and due diligence with a full scope of inspections including septic, water, etc, etc.  Here is the line from our offer they signed before we engaged our inspector:  

""All investigations will be done at Buyer's expense by persons chosen by Buyer in Buyer's sole discretion. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and shall give Buyer and Buyer's agents and consultants reasonable access to the property and its systems and fixtures in order to undertake the above investigations."" 

When the inspector arrived the water was shut off so they couldn't test the water or septic.  In fact, the septic couldn't even be located based on the description given to us by the owner despite a commendable effort on the part of our inspector.  ""In the back, by the peach tree"".  Um, no.  Unless by peach tree you mean dense thicket and weeds.  

We went back to the seller with an addendum requesting the following:

""Seller, at seller's expense, turn water on at the house so septic can be inspected. Seller, at seller's expense, locate septic tank lid and clear for access so septic can be inspected. Once the above items are complete, buyer to have an additional 7 days due diligence (par 12.) to complete inspections.""

We received notice today that they declined our addendum but didn't give any further details.  One sentence: ""seller respectfully declines the addendum requests.""

Anyone have any guesses as to what is going on here?  Do they not have water?  If so, that should have been disclosed, right?  How on earth can we complete inspections?  They must surely know this is a no go for the lender.  What am I missing? Maybe they got an offer in for cash after they accepted our offer and this is their way of worming out of agreement?

Is My 3–4 Week Peru Itinerary Too Packed? Should I Skip Something to Visit the Amazon?,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.**
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise?
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!",86,16,3492,508,1

"E-SIM for south america with at least 50+ gb data? (Argentina, chile and colombia for 2 months)","I will be going south to Argentina, Chile, and Colombia for around 1 month and a half. I am looking for an E-SIM option (Iphone 14) that has, ideally, at least 20gb of data. All of the e sim options for example, airalo, maxes out at around 10-20gb, but at the price it costs an arm and a leg. More expensive than my regional plan here in Canada. 

What are some good options for this? Some applications? Should I go down south, and then talk to someone there to get it cheaper? I'd ideally like to get it setup before I head down there. ",95,17,537,105,1
How to navigate?,"My Grandma has a reverse mortgage on her home around 340k her home is estimated to be valued at 600k+

She would love to keep the home in the family so she decided to offer it to me. 

What’s the best way to navigate this? I’ve seen people talking about putting the home in a trust and me inheriting it. Does this change anything on my end rather than just buying out what she owes? 

I would have to get a loan for the 340k but for a first house I don’t think that’s a bad price to pay and have equity off the start.

She would like to live in it until she passes and just have me figure out how to set it up so once she is gone I can instantly start the process of ownership.

Asbestos ,"This is a long shot … My boyfriend bought a house built in 1950 (210k) and bypassed doing an inspection. He has not moved in yet and has been renovating the outside as it’s easier to do with nicer weather. He began to do some work inside, like renovating closets, bathrooms, etc. when renovating a ceiling in the closet of his room, this gray, dusty, gold-like substance came pouring out. He didn’t know what it was and proceeded to sweep it up. Turns out, it’s Vermiculite and around 70% of it ever made during that time has asbestos. My boyfriend is a VERY health-conscious person and does not feel comfortable living in the home or continuing to do renovations as it risks more exposure. Even if it was “cleaned up”, he still doesn’t feel safe enough to live there. He feels so lost and I feel horribly for him. He has bought so much for that home, much of which cannot be returned at this point (15k). The price for complete removal is outrageous (20k+) and it’s even outrageous to only have one room cleaned ($2500) and air test ($1200).  NYS won’t test the vermiculite, and contractors have notified him that even the joints for the drywall pose a risk ($7500/room). He’s in such a bad spot and feels like there’s no good option for him. Any information of any kind would be helpful as we are both so lost. ",9,2,1313,242,0

How far in advance for Eurotar tickets,"Hey everybody.

My wife and I are travelling to Europe in late October, early November. Starting in Paris then heading up to Brussels and finally working our way to Amsterdam with a few stops along the way.

We're planning on taking Eurostar from Paris to Brussels and maybe from Antwerp to Rotterdam and then the regional trains for everything else.

I'm assuming we can get tickets for the regional trains day of. Is that a safe bet?

My question is, how far in advance do I have to get the Eurostar tickets? Is that something I can also pretty much always get right before the desired train or should I book those soon?

  
Thanks in advance.",38,7,645,113,1
Primary or investment purchase,"$1.9M purchase primary or investment property then convert later

I’m in a dilemma… my wife and I want to move to a great area and affluent part of Orange County where the price of homes is between $1.5-2M. We are currently in contract with a builder where the purchase price is right under $1.9M and we have a few months into next year until it’s done. We are fair off and have a few rental properties in addition to our current primary. We definitely want to put 20% down which we can if we sell off a couple investment properties and liquidate assets. I also make the income for a loan amount close to $1.1-1.3M at the max.

The question is, should we put down more money to get a conventional loan for a primary or use a different loan product like a DSCR combined with a 1031 exchange to consolidate some properties to make this purchase? The goal is the move in asap but if we go with the latter option, we would have to wait the 2 year minimum safe harbor. I don’t think I’d be able to qualify for a larger loan conventionally but on the DSCR, 20% is the minimum.

I’m at a loss cuz I don’t want to pay capital gains if I can help it but I also don’t want to have my family wait out 2 years before we can move into this home. Should we just pay the capital gains on selling some investment properties or something else? Is there any scenario where one could move into a rental before the 2 year safe harbor? I will get with a tax professional but was curious if anyone here has high level insight. Tysm!!",30,4,1511,288,0
malaysia travel,"Hi everyone! I'm an Indonesian Muslim, and my girlfriend is from Hong Kong. We’re planning a trip to Malaysia for New Year after being apart for four years. I’ve heard concerns about Syariah law in Malaysia, particularly regarding mixed-gender couples in hotel rooms.

I’m wondering if these laws primarily apply to Malaysian citizens or if they also affect foreign visitors. As an Indonesian Muslim, would it be okay for me to stay in a hotel room with my non-Muslim girlfriend?

Additionally, if there are any foreign Muslims who have traveled to Malaysia with non-Muslim partners, I’d love to hear about your experiences and any tips you may have. Thank you!",15,2,661,108,1
Nervous flyer worrying about layover times ,"Hey there! I 19F am flying from London Heathrow to Luleå Sweden to visit my long distance partner at his Uni! Now I have flown on my own before to see my partner in his hometown as they do direct flights from London Stansted to his hometown but the issue is this is my first time flying on my own where I have to get a connecting flight. I fly from Heathrow at 6:40am to Stockholm Arlanda which will land at 10:05am on the 30th Sept. I have a 1 hour 40 minute layover and then I should fly to Luleå at 11:45am. My parents and myself concern is that I might not have enough time eg ( security waiting times , passport control or flight is delayed) and might miss my flight? Of course it’s not the end of the world if I do and I will just catch the next one but it would be a headache. I forgot to also mention I am flying with SAS airlines! I have googled as much as I can like I have downloaded the map of the airport, I’m gonna buy fast track as well if I have to! So do you guys think I will be ok 🙃",43,7,1001,208,1
Argentina: Buenos Aires or Salta for 3-4 extra days,"Hello...I am taking a group tour in Argentina and Chile. This is not my normal (solo) mode of travel, but sounds like a decent value and will be relaxing for me to let someone else be I charge.   
I have have more time available (26 days), than the length of the tour (18 days). So, I have arranged to arrive 4 days earlier and leave 4 days later than the rest of the tour group. In the first 4 days. I am flying to see iguazu falls. Should be cool and fine. So far so good.  
For the last 4 days... December 26-29.. I am contemplating flying to Salta to explore. This would give me  2-1/2 to 3 days there.. leaving out flying time. 

The tour itself will go to the parana' delta area , rocoleta cemetery area, explore one or two neighborhoods in Buenosaires and gives us about half a day that is unstructured and on our own. This doesnt seem like much time to see the city. before we the fly off to Patagonia.   

my question is this. With 3-4 extra days... should I spend them getting to know Buenos Aires better, or try to fly to Salta... which seems to be interesting and cool. In the later option I would probably lose a day due to flying.. (the flight is only 2 hours, but to get to airport and out of airport twice etc.. will shoot most of a day.

I also considered taking a ferry to Uruguay and renting a car, but I read that Uruguay is quite sedate.... So.. Uruguay? Buenos Aires more in-depth or Salta?  

BTW, this will be my first time ever in South America. and I do not speak Spanish.  
but, I am a relatively experienced traveller.

appreciate ay input.",51,9,1568,304,1
First time investing in Duplex,"Hey guys, really need some advice as it is my first time investing:

My current house, market value is $560k, I have 100k remaining in mortgage. Currently paying $1007 mortgage, $320hoa, and $4000ish in property tax. Around $1700 per month to live in my house.

Im thinking of doing a cash out refinance and get $250k (so my new cost to live at current house will be $2000 total) and use it as a down payment for a $800k duplex (2bed 1 bath per unit) in Los Angeles. 

Will I lose money if I do this?

Any advice would be appreciated",30,5,533,98,0
